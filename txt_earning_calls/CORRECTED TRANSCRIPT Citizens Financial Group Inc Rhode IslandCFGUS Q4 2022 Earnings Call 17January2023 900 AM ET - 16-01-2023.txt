Q4 2022 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2023
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning everyone and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Fourth quarter and Full Year
2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Kelly, and I'll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in
a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a
reminder, this event is being recorded.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may
begin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kristin Silberberg
Head-Investor Relations, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and
CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results.
Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to
provide additional color. We will be referencing our fourth quarter and full year earnings presentation located on
our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions. Our comments today
will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to
differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on page 2 of the presentation. We're also
referencing non -GAAP financial measures. So it's important to review our GAAP results on page 3 of the
presentation and the reconciliations in the Appendix.
With that, I will hand over to you, Bruce.

Bruce Winfield Van Saun
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Okay. Thanks, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We are pleased with the
financial performance we delivered for the fourth quarter and the full year, and we feel well-positioned to navigate
through an uncertain environment in 2023. We are playing strong defense with a robust balance sheet position
and highly prudent credit risk appetite. At the same time, we continue to play disciplined offense with continuing
investments in our growth initiatives. We are focused on building out a prudent sustainable growth trajectory over
the medium term.
I'll comment briefly on the financial headlines, and let John take you through the details. For the quarter, our
underlying EPS was $1.32. Our return on tangible common equity was 19.4%, and the efficiency ratio was 54%.
Sequential operating leverage was 1%, and sequential PPNR growth was 2.6%. Leading our performance was
2% sequential NII growth, reflecting NIM expansion of 5 basis points to 3.3%, and relatively stable loans given the
impact of a $900 million reduction in our auto portfolio. Growth was 1% ex this impact. Deposits were solid with
1% sequential growth, and our LDR remained stable at 87%.
Our fee businesses showed resilience and diversity, given a challenging environment, down about 1%
sequentially. A number of M&A fees pushed into Q1, and mortgage results were softer than expected. We
maintained stable expenses in the quarter and credit metrics remained good. We boosted our allowance for credit
losses to 1.43% of loans, which compares with pro forma day one CECL levels of 1.30%. We restarted our share
repurchase activity in Q4, buying $150 million of stock, and we ended the year with a CET1 ratio of 10% at the top

of our targeted range. For full year 2022, we delivered underlying EPS of $4.84, and ROTCE of 16.4% as we
captured the benefit of rising rates and our strengthened deposit base.
The results handily exceeded our beginning of year guide, which we included in the appendix of the presentation.
With respect to our guidance for 2023, we assume a slowdown in economic growth to 1% for the year, two early
Fed rate hikes and a Q4 cut, and inflation getting below 3% by Q4. We project moderate loan growth, partially
offset by continued run-off in our auto book of close to $3 billion. Overall, we see solid NII growth as NIM
gradually rises to 3.4% over the year, a roughly 8% growth in fees given a rebound in capital markets fees over
the course of the year, solid expense discipline with core expense growth ex-acquisition and FDIC impacts of
3.5% to 4%.
We announced today our TOP 8 program, which targets a $100 million in run rate benefits, and about 80% of that
is expense impact. Credit should be manageable with net charge-offs in the 30 to 35-basis point range, and we
expect to build our ACL to 1.45% to 1.5% of loans. We expect to repurchase a meaningful amount of stock given
strong profitability, modest loan growth and limited expectation for acquisitions, with our CET1 ratio forecast near
the high-end of our 9.5% to 10% range. Capital return to shareholders should approach 100%, and yield to
investors of our dividends plus capital return via repurchase could top 12%. So all in all, a very strong year of
execution and delivery for all stakeholders by Citizens in 2022, and we feel we are well positioned in 2023 to
continue our journey towards becoming a top performing bank.
We continue to make good progress in executing on our strategic initiatives across consumer, commercial and
the enterprise. We've transformed our deposit base and are reaping the benefits. We've adjusted our interest
hedging to protect against lower rates through 2025. Given the improvement in our ROTCE over time, we are
raising our medium-term target to 16% to 18% from 14% to 16%. We've stayed focused on positive operating
leverage. We've captured the benefit of moving to a more normal rate environment and we still have plenty of
upside in our fee businesses as market conditions improve. Exciting times for Citizens. I'd like to end my remarks
by thanking our colleagues for rising to the occasion and delivering a great effort in 2022. We know we can count
on you again in the New Year.
And with that, I'll turn it over to John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Big picture, 2022 was a strong year for Citizens with significant
delivery of strategic initiatives against the backdrop of uncertainty and volatility in the macro environment. Most
notably, we closed our acquisitions of HSBC and ISBC. We captured the benefit of higher rates with strong NII
and NIM, and our balance sheet and interest rate position were well-managed. While fee revenues were impacted
by the environment, we are very well-positioned across our businesses to capitalize on the upside potential when
markets normalize, particularly in capital markets. Mortgage margins and volumes should recover over time, and
we are excited for the growth prospects arising from our wealth investments.
We are actively managing our loan portfolio, focusing on allocating capital where we can drive deeper relationship
business into 2023 and beyond. We continue to maintain good expense discipline, delivering in excess of $115
million of pre-tax run rate benefit from TOP 7, generating 4.7% underlying positive operating leverage for the year,
and 16.4% full-year ROTCE. Let me give you the headlines for the financial results, referencing slide 5. For the
fourth quarter, we reported underlying net income of $685 million and EPS of $1.32. Our underlying ROTCE for
the quarter was 19.4%. Net interest income was up 2% linked quarter with 5 basis points of margin expansion to

3.3%, and relatively stable loans given a planned reduction in our auto portfolio. Period-end and average loans
are broadly stable linked quarter, up 1%, excluding auto run-off.
We grew deposits up 1% linked quarter and our LDR was stable at 87%. Fees showed some resilience amid a
challenging environment, down 1% linked quarter. We saw a modest improvement in capital markets fees driven
by underwriting and M&A, but this was more than offset by a drop in mortgage fees and a [ph] CVA/DVA (09:13)
impact in our FX and IRP business. Expenses were broadly stable linked quarter. Overall, we delivered
underlying positive operating leverage of 1% linked quarter and our underlying efficiency ratio improved to 54.4%.
Our credit metrics were good with MCOs of 22 basis points, up 3 basis points linked quarter. We recorded a
provision for credit losses of $132 million, and a reserve build of $44 million this quarter. Our ACL ratio stands at
1.43%, up from 1.41% at the end of the third quarter, and approximately 13 basis points above our pro forma day
one CECL adoption coverage ratio. Our tangible book value per share is up 5% linked quarter.
Next, I'll provide further details related to the fourth quarter results. On slide 6, net interest income was up 2%,
given higher net interest margin. The net interest margin of 3.3% was up 5 basis points. As you can see on the
NIM mark on the bottom left hand side of the slide, a healthy increase in asset yields continues to outpace funding
costs, reflecting the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet. With fed funds increasing 425 basis points since the
end of 2021, our cumulative interest bearing deposit beta has been well controlled at 29% through the end of the
fourth quarter. Moving on to slide 7, we posted solid fee results despite headwinds from continued market
volatility and higher rates. These were fairly stable, down 1% linked quarter with lower mortgage and FX and
derivatives, partly offset by an improvement in capital markets fees.
Focusing on capital markets, market volatility continued through the quarter. However, underwriting and M&A
advisory fees ticked up. We continue to see good strength in our M&A pipelines, including several deals that were
pushed into Q1. Mortgage fees were softer as the higher rate environment continued to weigh on production
volumes. We are seeing pressure on volumes moderating and signs of the industry reducing capacity, which
should benefit margins over time. Servicing operating fees were stable. Card and wealth fees posted solid results
for the quarter. On slide 8, expenses were well controlled, broadly stable, linked quarter. Our TOP 7 efficiency
program delivered over $115 million of pre-tax run rate benefits by the end of the year. We are excited to
announce the launch of our new TOP 8 program, and I'll cover that in a few slides.
On slide 9, average and period-end loans were broadly stable linked quarter, but up 1% ex-auto run-off, with 1%
growth in commercial, reflecting demand in asset-backed financing and growth in CRE, primarily reflecting line
draws and slower paydowns. We are seeing commercial utilization moderated a bit over the quarter as inflation
and supply chain pressures continue easing and clients are adjusting inventories to reflect this, as well as lower
CapEx in anticipation of a softer economy. Average retail loans are down slightly, but up 1% ex-planned run-off in
auto given growth in mortgage and home equity, which bring in opportunity for deeper relationships and better
risk-adjusted returns.
On slide 10, average deposits were up $1.4 billion or 1% linked quarter, with growth primarily coming from term
deposits, money market accounts and Citizens Access Savings. Overall, commercial banking deposits were up
2.4% and consumer banking deposits were broadly stable. We feel good about how we are optimizing deposit
costs in this rate environment. Our interest bearing deposit costs were up 67 basis points, which translates to a
29% cumulative beta, broadly consistent with our expectations.
We began the rate cycle with a strong liquidity and funding profile, including significant improvements to our
deposit mix and capabilities. We achieved overall deposit growth this quarter, and will continue to optimize our
deposit base and to invest in our capabilities to attract durable customer deposits. Overall, liquidity remained

strong as we reduced our FHLB advances by $1.3 billion, and increased our cash position at quarter end. Our
period-end LDR improved slightly to 86.7%. Moving on to slide 11, we saw good credit results again this quarter
across the retail and commercial portfolios. Net charge-offs were 22 basis points, up 3 basis points linked quarter,
which is still low relative to historical levels.
Non-performing loans are 60 basis points of total loans, up 5 basis points in the third quarter given an increase in
commercial largely in CRE. Retail delinquencies continued to remain favorable to historical levels, but we
continue to closely monitor leading indicators to gauge how the consumer is fairing. Although personal disposable
income remains strong, debt service as a percentage of disposable income has essentially returned to pre-
pandemic levels, while consumer confidence has stabilized as inflation has eased. Turning to slide 12, I'll walk
through the drivers of the allowance this quarter. While our current credit metrics are good, we increased our
allowance by $44 million taking into account the growing risk of an economic slowdown. Our overall coverage
ratio stands at 1.43%, which is a modest increase from the third quarter.
The current reserve level contemplates a moderate recession and incorporates expectations of lower asset
prices, and the risk of added stress on certain portfolios, including those subject to higher risk from inflation,
supply chain issues, higher interest rates and return-to-office trends. Given these pressures, we are watching our
loan portfolio very carefully for early signs of stress, in particular CRE office.
Back on slide 32 in the appendix, we have provided some additional information about the CRE portfolio. Our total
CRE allowance coverage of 1.86% includes elevated coverage for the office portfolio, while the multifamily
portfolio has a much lower reserve requirement. The $6.3 billion office portfolio includes $2.2 billion of credit
tenant and life sciences properties, which are not as exposed to adverse back to office trends. The remaining $4
billion relates to the general office segment, for which we are holding a roughly 5% allowance coverage. About
95% of the general office portfolio is income-producing and about 70% is located in suburban areas.
Moving to slide 13. We maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10%, which is
at the top end of our range. Tangible book value per share was up 5% in the quarter and the tangible common
equity ratios improved to 6.3%. We've returned a total of $350 million to shareholders through share repurchases
and dividends. Our strong capital position, combined with our earnings outlook, puts us in a position to continue to
return capital to shareholders through share repurchases.
Shifting gears a bit. Starting on slide 14, we'll cover some of the unique opportunities we have to drive
outperformance over the next few years. We have tried to be very disciplined in prioritizing the areas that we think
have big potential and where we have a right to win. So, in consumer, we've got four big opportunities. First is our
push into New York Metro. We are investing in brand marketing, doing well in the technology conversions, and
putting our best people against the market opportunity.
We are encouraged by our early success with some recent client wins in commercial and the HSBC branches
driving some of the highest customer acquisition and sales rates in our network. The full ISBC conversion is just
around the corner on Presidents Weekend, and we look forward to making further strides as we leverage the full
power of our product lineup and customer-focused retail and small business model across the New York market.
You will see more details on slide 28 and 29 in the appendix.
Importantly, we achieved about 70% in run rate of our planned $130 million of Investors' net expense synergies
as of the end of the year, and we expect to capture the rest by the middle of the year. We also continue to expect
that the integration costs will come in below our initial estimates.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2023
Moving to wealth, we launched a number of exciting initiatives with Citizens Private Client and CitizensPlus as we
[ph] oriented (00:17:55) the business towards financial planning-led advice. These should really help us penetrate
the opportunity with our existing customer base.
On slide 15, our national expansion is another area where we have a great opportunity to build on our digital
platform that has been focused on deposits for the last few years. We've moved that to a cloud-based platform
and we are adding our other product capabilities so that we can offer a complete digital bank experience to serve
customers nationwide with a focus on the young/mass affluent market segment. Where we might have only had a
lending or deposit relationships for, our vision is to build a national platform that allows us to serve our customers
in a comprehensive way.
And we have also been very innovative in creating distinctive ways to serve customers. Citizens Bank, for
example, is area where we have significant running room. We've attracted many new partners, up about 150
versus a year ago, which should really ramp the business. And we've built an industry-leading home equity
business, powered by our innovative FastLine process, which is enabled by advanced analytics and digital
innovations that have drastically reduced originations time.
Moving to the commercial bank on slide 16 and 17. We've filled in all the product gaps. Acquisitions brought us
M&A and other advisory capabilities and we built out debt capital markets capabilities organically. We've hired
some great coverage bankers and we are focused on high growth regions around the country and the right
industry verticals to serve larger companies. We also have a very strong sponsor coverage and are well-
positioned to support private equity capital. Bottom line, we've aligned ourselves with the attractive opportunities
with a full product set to drive significant market share and fee revenues.
Moving to slide 18. We are excited to announce the launch of our latest TOP program. Even as we push forward
on offense with our strategic initiatives and acquisitions, it is important to remember that a key to Citizens'
success since our IPO has been our continuous effort to find new revenue pools and realize efficiencies and then
reinvest those benefits back into our businesses so we can serve customers better.
We've effectively executed our TOP 7 program, achieving a pre-tax run rate benefit of approximately $115 million
at the end of 2022. And we've launched TOP 8 with a goal of an exit run rate of about $100 million in pre-tax
benefits by the end of 2023 with that split about 80/20 between efficiency and revenue-oriented initiatives.
Moving to slide 19, I'll offer the outlook for the full year, which contemplates an economic slowdown and the end
of December forward curve view of two 25 basis points Fed hikes before an expected 25 basis point cut in the
fourth quarter. We expect solid NII growth of 11% to 14% and we project our NIM to gradually rise towards
approximately 3.4% for the fourth quarter of 2023. Our overall hedge position is expected to provide a NIM floor of
about 3.2% through the fourth quarter of 2024 and a gradual 200 basis point decline across the curve
commencing in Q4 2023.
In the fourth quarter, we took actions to transition $3 billion of active swaps from 2023 to forward starting positions
in 2024. And we've done even more so far in January to rebalance the distribution of down-rate protection. You'll
find a summary of our hedge position in the appendix on slide 30.
We expect moderate loan growth with average loans up about 4% to 5%. We are targeting about $3 billion of spot
auto runoff as we shift the portfolio towards products with more attractive risk-adjusted returns. We expect total
average earning assets to be up 3% to 4%. On the deposit side, we see 3% average deposit growth and a 2% to

3% spot deposit decline with cumulative deposit betas at year-end reaching the high-30s. Fees are expected to
be up 7% to 9% with the capital markets rebound building over the course of the year.
Non-interest expense is expected to be up roughly 7% or about 3.5% to 4% if you adjust for the full year effect of
the HSBC and Investors acquisitions and the FDIC premium increase. If the year unfolds as we expect, we should
be able to drive about 400 to 500 basis points of positive operating leverage.
Given current macro trends in portfolio originations, we expect that our ACL ratio will rise to the 1.45% to 1.5%
level depending upon how the economy fares. We expect our CET1 ratio to land at the upper end of our target
range of 9.5% to 10%, even with our target payout ratio approaching 100%. All of this translates into a ROTCE in
the high teens for 2023.
On slide 20, we provide the guide for Q1. Note that Q1 is seasonally weak for us with the day count impact and
seasonality impacting revenues and taxes on compensation payouts impacting expenses.
Moving to slide 21. As Bruce mentioned, we have completely transformed the franchise since the IPO, executing
well against our priorities and achieving our desired performance targets. And we are ready to raise the bar, lifting
our ROTCE target to 16% to 18%. The key to the further ROTCE improvement is continuing to deliver positive
operating leverage. As we look out over the medium term, we should see a recovery in loan and deposit growth
and we will continue our balance sheet optimization efforts to focus on deep relationship lending to maximize risk-
adjusted returns.
We are well-positioned to grow fees meaningfully; and even if rates come down a bit, we expect NII to benefit
from the protection we've put on through the swap portfolio. You should expect us to stay disciplined on
expenses. Credit is projected to be stable as the economy strengthens, and we continue to focus on returning a
meaningful amount of capital to our shareholders through our repurchase program and targeting a dividend
payout of 35% to 40%. Over this timeframe, we would expect our CET1 ratio to remain within our target range of
9.5% to 10%.
To sum up, slide 22, we delivered a strong quarter against the backdrop of a dynamic environment, and we have
a positive outlook for 2023. We are ready for the uncertainty of an economic slowdown in 2023 with a strong
capital liquidity and funding position. We've taken actions to protect our NIM and we are being prudent with
respect to our credit risk appetite and loan growth. At the same time, we are moving forward, executing against
our strategy and making important investments in our business that we believe will deliver sustainable growth and
outperformance over the medium term.
With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. We are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]
Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
It sounds like you guys rebalanced some of the hedges in the fourth quarter and are continuing to do so year-to-
date so far. I was hoping you might please just expand upon how you're thinking on [indiscernible] (00:25:55)
changed since last quarter and sort of how you intend to position yourself?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll go ahead and start off. I mean, big picture, asset sensitivity last quarter was around 3%. We're a little bit
below that this quarter just given the way the outlook for the balance sheet appears to be playing out in 2023. So,
as you've seen over time, we've taken our asset sensitivity down. Most of that asset sensitivity is really driven by
the short end of the curve, which we expect to remain elevated throughout 2023. And as a result, we're looking at
some of the down rate protection that we had in place in 2023 and just repositioning that out of spot-starting
active swaps into forward-starting swaps into 2024 and beyond. So we're looking to basically push that out and
basically get that down rate protection smoothed out into the 2024 and 2025 periods rather than holding on to all
of that down rate protection here in 2023. That's the main objective and what we were doing in fourth quarter and
we've done a little bit more of that in early 1Q.
And then more broadly, we're looking at net interest margin. That corridor, if you will, we're trying to protect that
corridor with – at the low end if rates were to fall by 200 basis points out in 2024, then you'll see a floor of around
320 basis points. So you see that 320 to 340 basis points corridor being something that over time is more narrow
than you would have seen from us maybe in past cycles. So that's the main objective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. And I would just add to that, Scott, I mean, our view in the macro is that the Fed likely moves maybe once
or twice the forward curves as they'll move up 25 basis points a couple of times and then stop. And then typically
they would pause for six or seven months before they would cut. And so, if there's a cut happening, it likely
happens very late in the year and maybe it could be early next year. So, guided by that view, that's kind of why
we're pushing out that downside protection a bit.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2023
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Terrific. Thank you very much. And then just a separate question. It looks like fees will need to rebound fairly
meaningfully following the first quarter to hit the guide. I know, Bruce, you had mentioned an expectation for
improved capital markets through the year. Maybe just a thought or two on how you see the main drivers of that
fee guide as the year progresses, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Sure. So I think, really, you put your finger on it there, Scott, is the capital markets business. We've had really
strong pipelines this year. But because of the volatility, because of the fact that the Fed is still moving higher,
that's created uncertainty and just an inability to actually get the money to work from private equity or some of the
deals done because the financing hasn't been there the way it's been in the past. And so, I think as you – going
back to that macro forecast, as the Fed is likely nearing kind of the destination in terms of peak rates, I think that
starts to loosen up the markets – the financing markets. You'll see less volatility and just a lot of the businesses
kind of clocked into our pipelines and start to print and get delivered, and we'll start to see more transactions.
So, just by reference, most of the quarters this year, our capital markets revenues were at $90 million to $100
million. If you go back to the fourth quarter of 2021, we had $184 million of fees, so roughly double that level. So
we thought coming into this year that we'd have much stronger levels of revenue generation. But the good news is
we still have a great overall focus on the right sectors in the market. We've got a great team. And so, I think you'll
see that start to rev up as we see the market conditions improve.
Beyond that, I'm also quite optimistic. We've made a lot of investments in the wealth business. And again, there, if
you start to see some stability in the asset markets, we should get a kind of tailwind from that, plus the
investments that we've made. So, I feel confident about that. And then I'd say, mortgage is so washed out, I keep
thinking, it can't go any lower, and it did in the fourth quarter. But I think you're starting to see people exit the
business and capacity coming out of the business. And so, you'll start to see margins expand and I think volumes
will tick up as we go through the year, again, linked back to the Fed reaching the destination and some stability on
rates. So, those would be the big things.
I'm happy to pass the floor in here, Don, do you want to say anything else?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I think you've pretty much covered it on cap markets. I said this last quarter; I'll just remind people again. We are a
middle market investment bank. So we're not dependent on these giant transactions that need $5 billion of
financing. We do singles and doubles all day long and our pipelines are reasonably strong with a very heavy
content of private equity who is awash with cash. So there will be transactions. If you don't get [ph] regular rate
(00:31:24) transactions, you're going to get a lot of restructuring transactions. So there's minority capital, there's a
lot of different ways to skin the cat. So we're relatively optimistic about what's ahead of us in the coming year.

Brendan Coughlin A
Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I think you nailed it pretty well. I'd say, well, for the year, we're projecting slow and steady continued
progress and it's a bit of a coiled spring when the equity markets really come back. But as long as they're stable,
we should see some growth. I'd say the other bright spot is debit and ATM fees that continue to hit records both
through customer engagement and primacy and all the investments we made in the health of the franchise that's
also translating into our deposit quality. Also some restructure on vendor relationships and such that's giving us a
bit of a boost there too, so that should be a continued area of slow and steady progress. On the other side, there
will continue to be a little bit of pressure still on overdraft income and service charges, but we're sort of near the
bottom...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A

Good morning. I wanted to ask on credit. John, you mentioned that most of the increase in non-performing loans
was commercial real estate. I was just wondering, was that office related and if you can just give a little bit more
color on what your outlook is for office.

John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)

CRE coverage from an allowance standpoint is around 186 basis points. But when you carve out some of the

really high quality stuff in multifamily and credit tenant lease and life science, as you get to our general office
segment where we have very healthy coverage of around 5%. So, we are seeing some trends there that are
telling us that we should be putting away some reserves to deal with the back to office trends that are a headwind
in that space. So, you get good healthy coverage of around 5%. We are seeing some of that kick into the
nonaccrual space. I would say, more broadly, even though that goes into nonaccrual, our overall CRE LTVs are
typically around 60%. And so, you got to distinguish nonaccruals from actual loss content. And so, even though
we're putting some allowance away, we feel like that's commensurate with the loss content that we see in the
book. And maybe I'll just stop there and...

Bruce Winfield Van Saun A

And Don, do you want to add...?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
No, I'll just say for the office portfolio, but CRE in general, it's first and foremost who's the sponsor and who's the
investor. And we have a very high quality group of investors that we do business with, which are largely
institutional. Second is what MSAs are you in and where are you. And we think suburban will do better than
urban. And as we said in the comments, we're heavily weighted to suburban. So, we're going through every single
property in the office portfolio. We'll restructure a lot of them with the sponsors. We've restructured one already
this year where the sponsor contributed equity. So, we're comfortable around where we are with the coverage
ratios right now, but we'll be active in restructuring the portfolio. But we kind of like the contours of what we've got.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, can you just talk about what changed in the updated margin
guidance of towards 340 basis points versus the prior guidance of 350 basis points? Is it just the higher deposit
beta outlook?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll go ahead and cover that. I mean, I think more broadly, it's two overall comments. Really, just given the
pace and speed of rate changes and the impact on the migration of the deposit mix that we expect as you get into
2023 is really most and the majority of what we're looking at. And that migration manifests itself in two ways. It's
really the amount of DDA migration that we see as well as the cost of – relatively low cost deposits that we're
seeing not only within our platform but across the industry. So, from that perspective, just kind of marking that to
market with respect to what we're seeing and the trends in the fourth quarter and the rate and curve outlook that
we see going throughout the rest of 2023.
I would hasten to add what's embedded in there nevertheless is a transformed deposit platform that back, prior to
the pandemic, we would have had DDA percentages that would be in the low-20s compared with a majority of the
portfolio being outside of DDA, of course. But you fast-forward to where we are in the fourth quarter and we're at
28% of our deposit franchise is sitting in DDA. That's a significant increase versus pre-pandemic. And we expect
to end the year in the sort of the mid to high-20s in the DDA space, down a little bit from where we are today, but
nevertheless still very high quality.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2023
And when you add in consumer [indiscernible] (00:37:02) and consumer savings, which is other low cost, you end
up with still about 50% or more of our deposit portfolio sitting in low-cost categories. That's up from the low-40s
prior to the pandemic. So, this has been a multi, multiyear transformation of the deposit franchise. So I think we're
basically just calibrating what we expect in 2023, which was the majority of what we saw in terms of the decline
from 350 basis points to 340 basis points.
I think you could also add in what's going on with the curve and front book/back book as well. When you look at
just how quickly rates are rising, the front book originations take a longer time to contribute. And from that
perspective, we're seeing that being a driver as well. And not only the speed of – I guess, the last point I'll make is
not only the speed of rates rising, but the inversion of the yield curve is something that is also pretty – is a
headwind to front book/back book. Just to end it with, nevertheless, front book/back book is a positive tailwind
over time. We're seeing 300 basis points of positive front book/back book across securities and our fixed rate
lending businesses. That's still a tailwind and that's going to be a driver into 2023 with net interest margins rising,
just not by quite as much as we thought last quarter.

Thanks. Hi. Good morning. Wondering, Bruce, I heard your early comments about we're at 1.30% ACL day one
adjusted for the deals in the low-1.40s now and your comments about 1.45%, 1.50% year-end. I'm just wondering
if you can help us, given that you're slowing loan growth and letting the auto book run out, how do you just help us
understand what you're seeing in terms of what your CECL impact might be looking ahead versus the impact of
slower loan growth in terms of that endpoint that you're expecting? Thanks.

I'll start, John, you can pick up. But I'd say what we've done for the past several quarters is kind of keep looking
forward as to what's the macro forecast and are there any particular segments of the portfolio that could come
under stress given that the Fed has continued to push higher and the economic growth has been downgraded. So
I think there's – like I read today that over 60% of the leading economists are projecting a forecast for this year.
So, the reason that we've been building gradually is just taking that into account.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2023
I think at some point you kind of get the cards turned up in 2023 and you'll have more information and less
uncertainty. But we don't see that where we sit today. So I think it's prudent to continue to view the course, likely
course is that the ACL will go up a couple of basis points a quarter like we've done and get into that 1.45% to
1.50% range at some point, then you'll have seen whatever the recessionary impact is, and then you'll be looking
forward, and then you may get to the point where you can release some of those reserves depending on what
your charge-off experience is. Clearly, can the slower loan growth plays into that to some degree is mitigating
what the build could have been. But anyway, those are the dynamics at play. John, unless you want to add to
that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, I'll add there. I mean, just for the last couple of quarters, we've had a mild to moderate recession built into
the ACL. And so our peak-to-trough GDP decline that we have built into our models are 1.5%. That would be a
moderate recession at this point. I think the changes you may have seen in the second half of 2022, were not
quite as much on the expectation that there would be a recession as much as what the collateral value outlook
really impact was. So when you think about house prices and used car prices, et cetera, we've been increasing
the amount of decline expected. So you've got sort of the low to mid-teens declines now built into our models for
both house prices and auto prices over the foreseeable kind of a period. And that's not really driving a lot of
losses, just so you know, we've been having a lot of recoveries in the portfolio over the last year or so. And so you
might see some lower recoveries, and that'll have the – you saw our loss that's built into our loss forecast for
2023. But I think, that's an important item that you saw in 4Q in terms of our outlook for 2023 and 2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got it. Okay. Thanks. And just one quick follow up on the capital points. Your nearing 100% implies a nice
incremental step up in the buyback. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about the mix of the dividend versus
the buyback going forward. You obviously moved to $0.42 in the third quarter. Should we also think about that
you would be moving the dividend up in line with increased earnings potential as well within that context?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'd say, what we do here is, every year we're on a cadence where post-CCAR, we basically take that as the
opportunity to broadly update our capital return profile. Over the medium term, we're looking at 35% to 40%
dividend payout, and you saw that in some of our medium-term outlook. We've updated that this is going to be
more of a buyback return year in 2023 because of the outlook for RWAs. But we take a look at dividend policy
and earnings outlook and update whether there should be a change in the dividend after CCAR.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. And I would just add to that, Ken, that clearly with the uncertainty in the environment, we are being cautious
in terms of the lending of kind of risk appetite. And so I think, that in and of itself creates some additional capital
versus what we've had in prior years. I also think we still have our plate full in integration of existing acquisitions,
and we haven't seen a whole lot that's attractive at valuation that we're interested in on the acquisition front. And
so I think the combination of operating at very high profitability levels with ROTCE returns in the high-teens, plus
more modest loan growth and historical more modest acquisition activity than historical creates the opportunity,
and I think it's appropriate given the uncertainty and chance for recession, that returning capital to shareholders is

the right course of action here. So you could expect we would like to raise the dividend during the course of the
year, and we'd also like to get close to that 100% return of capital to shareholders.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Sure. Yeah. That's sounds good. Yeah. I mean, I think, overall, as I mentioned before, we're seeing deposit
migration from a DDA perspective as well as from some of our lower cost levels, but broadly the mix is superior
and improved compared to pre-pandemic. I think we're around 28% DDA in 4Q. That's probably going to tick
down a bit probably to maybe 27% or so by the end of the year. That's part of the story. I'd say, some of the
higher cost deposits in money markets and savings will be part of the run-off as well, such that you get to
something along the lines of a 2% to 3% decline spot-to-spot end of 2022 into 2023. And so I'd say that, you end
up with some, again, improved mix compared to pre-pandemic, but a little bit of mix softening as you get
throughout 2023, and I'll just maybe...

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2023
I would just add, I would add to that is that, I'd say, we did not take in as much surge deposit as many in our peer
group. We have a consumer-tilted deposit base which tends to be more stable. And so we've been monitoring that
surge deposits quite carefully, and we have seen it actually be more sticky than we initially expected. I think
where you'd see a slight run-off probably is more on the commercial side where treasuries have other alternatives
besides bank deposits to move some money out. But again, we're relatively protected there because we didn't
take in a lot of that money in terms of surge deposits. So maybe, Don, you could comment and then Brendan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I think our spot is down a little less than 2% year-to-year. We actually ended this year a little higher than we
thought we were going to because we had some nice inflow at the end of the year. But I think John said it in his
comments, we've really transformed our deposit base really off the back of our treasury services business. So
both specialty deposit offerings, we've got two that we're now in the market with around ESG, green deposits and
carbon offsets. And then just a strengthening of our DDA deposits with our treasury services business gives us
more stability than we would have had in prior years. So we feel pretty good about that projection. And in general,
we're really managing the balance sheet from a BSO standpoint, and really we're avoiding most new transactions
given just a shyness around the credit environment and the uncertainty, and we're moving clients who aren't
generating positive returns off the franchise and off the balance sheet. So it gives us a little bit of a dynamic that
we don't really need to go chase deposits because we're keeping the loan side relatively modestly in terms of how
it grows.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Without being too redundant to what John mentioned, I'd say, consumers have been broadly stable on
deposits, which is a really good thing. And the story for us is going to be controlling the mix. But all indications are
quite positive. We're looking at a lot of benchmarking data, and we're pretty confident that we're performing in the
top quartile of our peer banks in terms of retention of low-cost deposits, as well as interest-bearing deposit costs
so far in the cycle, sort of midway through the cycle. So we've got to stay disciplined and manage it well. But it's
been driven by a lot of health improvements, household growth, improvement in finder fee, mix shift to Bruce's
point, we were 45% mass affluent and above five years ago. We're now 60% of our customer base is mass
affluent and above. So the quality has been quite good.
On the stimulus front, what we're seeing is, the bottom two deciles of our customer base is essentially back to
paycheck to paycheck. So that stimulus has already burned off, and is in the rearview mirror. So the stimulus that
remains with us tends to be with the more affluent customers, whether that's actual stimulus checks or that's
balance parking that happened during COVID for not making mortgage payments and not traveling, et cetera, et
cetera. We're not actually seeing that burn-off as much as we're starting to see that rotate out of low-cost deposits
into interest-bearing, which is natural given the state of interest rates. So we're managing that really tight.
All the investments we've made in the franchise, whether it's analytics, new products, the introduction of
CitizensPlus and our Private Client Group, as well as having Citizens Access to fence off interest-bearing
deposits to maintain discipline in the core have all been really big levers for us to manage well. And all indications
we see so far is that, we're right on track with where we want it to be and dramatically outperforming where we
were last time in an upgrade cycle, and at worst in line with peers with some signs that we may be doing a bit
better, which is a big turnaround from where we were five, six years ago.

Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay. Great. Thank you. That's helpful. And then separately on the commercial real estate front, I know you've
stated 60% LTV on overall commercial real estate. Is that at origination? And then, do you happen to have
refreshed LTVs? I know you mentioned that a lot of your deals have sponsor participation, but we're hearing that
with sponsors exiting or refinancing out of certain deals that impact the LTV. So the refreshed LTV may be a
better read, particularly on the office front. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. The office, the 60% was the office LTVs in terms of not the overall CRE book. So we think those are still
pretty good. We're refreshing it property by property. We haven't gone through and done a total refresh on the
entirety of the book yet, but we're kind of working it on the maturing quarter-by-quarter maturities, and working
with the sponsors to either refinance out, inject equity or adjust the value of the portfolio. And that's what drove
the NPL this quarter. So it was really one real estate deal.

Nathan Stein Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hey, everyone. This is Nathan Stein on behalf of Matt O'Connor. On capital, so the 9.5% to 10% medium term
CET1 target range, that's well above the regulatory minimum. You've built reserves a lot, and it seems like the
conversion timeline of ISBC is going really well. So I guess my question is, why hold so much capital down the
road given solid reserves and successful deal integration timeline?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I would say, part of it is just the philosophy of liking to have a strong balance sheet. And so I think, 9.5% to
10% is a strong ratio. You've seen over time that we originally had a target of 10% and 10.5%, and we've been

kind of sliding that down as our profitability goes up. And I think the stakeholders gain more confidence that we
have a good strategy, and we're executing well. So it wouldn't surprise me at some point where we start to
manage down in that range. I think the time of 2023 today when we're looking at a potential recession to be at the
top end of that range makes sense. But once we get to the other side of that, to start to move that down and
maybe manage that closer to the bottom end of that range, we'll provide more leverage. And then at that point, I
think we could step back and say, do we still need 9.5% to 10%, or can we skinny that down a little bit. So I think
that's all in front of us, we thought at this point. Given the dynamics around 2023, it wouldn't make sense to
actually move that target range down.

Nathan Stein Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

this year. What are your expectations for other loan categories in 2023 coming off of a strong 2022? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll go ahead and start there and others can chime in, but I mean, I think when you look out into 2023, we
still see very, very strong opportunities in the commercial space and within C&I. And I think something to always
keep in mind is, our utilization is well below where historical levels would imply we should be. And so as you get
into the later part of the year, you see some recovery in investment, in inventories and CapEx and possibly M&A,
which actually provides financing opportunities. We see lots of opportunities across commercial, and that's really
one of the main drivers. When you get into consumer, we're looking at home equity being a place that we like, and
card and Citizens Pay would contribute as well. So all of that wraps up to a stable year-over-year on loans, and
back to the point around that being taking that otherwise, RWA that would have been deployed against auto and
some other categories with lower risk adjusted returns and giving that back to shareholders.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the NIM line of questioning. I think you brought down the floor for
NIM from 3.25% to 3.2%. Is that also a function of what you mentioned on the DDA migration, and the curve and
also the fact that you pushed out the forward swaps? Is the biggest variable on that number mostly the cost of
funding side, or I guess, would there be any changes to that 3.2% number if the Fed cut rates sooner?

Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll start and flip to John. It's Bruce. But I think, the two numbers are tethered together. So if the 3.50% is
now seen to be 3.40%, then your floor is going to also commensurately move lower. The good news is, in a way,
is that we've taken the bottom side of that range. So previously, it was 3.50% down to 3.20%, back to 3.25%. So it
was 25 basis points, and now it's 3.40% to 3.20%. So it's 20 basis points. So anyway, I think, certainly, John's
initial answer on the movement down has been focused more on migration, the DDA and low-cost migration, but
then also some of the impact from the yield curve on front book/back book has been the other dynamic. So those
are the things that we're watching. But John, you can pick up from there.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2023
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. So the only thing I'd add, just remember, we constructed, we modeled that 3.20%, and there's a lot of
assumptions that go into that with respect to what the mix of the balance sheet would be, et cetera. And what
we're assuming is a 200-basis point gradual decline in 2024 that would get you down to that 3.20%. And given
that we are still asset sensitive, and we haven't closed out that position, that's really what you're seeing in terms of
the decline in net interest margins. So as and when we continue to look at ways to lock in, protection against
down rates, you could see that 3.20% basis points move around based on hedging activities, as well as updated
views on what the mix of the balance sheet is likely to be in the context of what the fed does.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
It's a very dynamic process. So we look and see where the forward curve say rates are going to be. We have our
own view of that. We see what the valuations we can get and the hedge market are, and you can be assured. I
think we've played our hand quite well so far, and we'll continue to stay really focused on this.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

I appreciate that. And then separately, just on the TOP 8 program, can you unpack some of the drivers there of
the $100 million in pre-tax benefits, and maybe how quickly those can come out from the expense base over the
course of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll go and cover that. I'd say, the one dynamic to keep in mind is that, we tend to form these programs and
generate a year-end run rate benefit that will contribute for each of them. So on the one hand, the $100 million will
build throughout 2023 so that it gets to a run rate when you get to the fourth quarter of 2023. But keep in mind, we
did the same thing with TOP 7. So there's a full year effect of TOP 7 that comes in. And so when the programs
are reasonably similarly sized, you can almost use that as an estimate of what the contribution is in any given
year. And so you have maybe a combined $100 million plus contribution from the full year effect of TOP 7 hitting
2023, and the in-year effect of TOP 8 hitting 2023. And so the big drivers of that really are in couple of places.
You've got the traditional areas that we focus on which is third-party costs and vendor cost management, which is
an area that we've been − that's been contributing over the years, as well as continue to optimize the branch
network, and just being really careful about, ensuring that our organizational approach is fit for purpose with
respect to what we're trying to accomplish in 2023. So those are more traditional areas. The other places we're
looking at that have been more recent include maturing our agile delivery model away from a waterfall approach
to agile, and next-gen technology initiatives continue to contribute as well. We're working towards a data center
exit in 2025. We're looking to migrate to the cloud from our internal applications, and that's contributing in 2023 as
well. But there's a lot of very strategic sort of initiatives that are built within the TOP 8 program. We're excited
about it. It's part of who we are, and we're looking forward to deliver against that next year.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2023
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of questions for you folks. Firstly, the deposit betas that you expect to
get to the high 30s, given the pace of change in the fourth quarter and your expectation for rate hikes early in the
year and not after that, should we expect you get to that in Q1? Any color on that, on the pace of it, especially
given how rates have been going up?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean, I think, we'll not get there in Q1. That is an over the year expectation in terms of the cumulative
growth. I mean, I think you'll see the growth in cumulative betas begin to moderate and flatten out. You get the big
jumps early in the cycle, so and we began, and go way back to the second quarter of 2022, our cumulative beta
was 6%. And then, you get to the fourth quarter, the cumulative beta is 29%, so you've got 23 points just in 2022.
And then what we're looking for in 2023 is another 9 points. So this is going to – and it'll increase over time. You
won't get to 38% in the first quarter, it will gradually rise.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Deposits tend to reprice with a lag. So even after the fed pauses, you still see a little bit of upward pressure on
those betas.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
That's right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. But then does that mean, Bruce, the bulk of it is probably early on, and just a little further increase after
that, after the fed jump?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I'd say, the majority in 1H, and it continues to trickle in into 2H. And that's built into our outlook.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Different question, the second one. Fee income, your guide of about 7% to 9% growth in full year 2023
versus 2022, how much of that would you expect would come from capital markets, or at least what's in your
forecast that you're thinking, how much comes from capital markets?

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2023
Yeah. I think there's a big part of it. I mean, I think, back to the big drivers, you had capital markets and you heard
about card fees from Brendan and wealth from Brendan as well. So those are the three big ones. You'd see
mortgage really...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
A little bit of rebound.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
...potentially rebounding as well. But a big part of it would come from capital markets from the underwriting
perspective. And M&A advisory, just as we may have mentioned in the fourth quarter, we saw some deals push
from 4Q into 1Q. So that's going to support the capital markets business, which, by the way, over the years has
really become a very diversified capital markets business itself, I mean, just broadening out M&A advisory,
underwriting and loan syndications. Those businesses really tend to really diversify our overall fee outlook. But
yeah, a good part of it and a good chunk of the growth in 2023 comes from capital markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions in queue. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mr. Van Saun for

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Okay. Great. So thanks again, everyone, for dialing in today. We certainly appreciate your interest and support.
Have a great day.

Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. And you may
now disconnect.
