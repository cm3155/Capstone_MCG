Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. As you know, Jason Tyler became our CFO as of January 1, as Biff
Bowman will be retiring after 35 years at Northern Trust. We're grateful to Biff for his many contributions as a
trusted colleague and thoughtful leader throughout his time, and especially for his significant contributions as CFO
for the previous five years. I welcome Jason to the CFO role. He brings deep financial expertise and leadership
experience, and I'm confident he will be very successful in the role.
Before Jason goes through our results in detail, I'd like to comment on some of the trends we're seeing in our
businesses. Our performance for 2019 continued to exhibit foundational strength, as we executed on a number of
growth strategies while continuing to advance our digital efforts and improve our productivity. Our results for the

year generated a return on average common equity of 14.9%. We also returned a record $1.7 billion to our
common shareholders through dividends and the repurchase of 11.8 million shares.
In our Wealth Management business, our capabilities and positioning continue to resonate in the marketplace. On
a year-over-year basis, assets under management grew 13% to $314 billion and assets under custody grew 18%
to $736 billion. On the capability front, spurring some of this growth, we continue to invest in our data, digital and
analytics capabilities as well as in innovations around the delivery of goals-driven holistic advice. We also closed
out the year with the opening of a new office in Philadelphia, and we were named the Best Private Bank by the
Financial Times Group for the ninth time out of the last 11 years. In sum, for Wealth Management, it was a very
solid year of performance and momentum.
Our Corporate & Institutional Services business remains focused on executing its growth strategies, digitalizing
the business and innovating for the future to enable scalable growth. Assets under custody and administration
ended the year at $11.3 trillion, up 19% from the prior year. We continue to achieve healthy organic growth in our
core asset servicing fees within both the asset manager and asset owner segments, driven by our strong
positioning. We are also making targeted investments that are expected to continue to fuel growth in areas like
front and middle office outsourcing and capital markets. For example, we launched new capabilities in front office
solutions, integrated trading solutions, and currency management in 2019.
Finally, C&IS is executing a multi-year strategy to digitize the business to drive more profitable, scalable and
sustainable growth into the future. In asset management, we ended the year with $1.2 trillion in assets under
management, an increase of 15% from the prior year. As the industry transitions through key secular shifts, we
are delivering long-term value to stakeholders through first, strengthening our areas of competitive advantage
such as portfolio construction, quantitative research and liquidity management; second, prioritizing investment in
growth markets and growth segments such as financial intermediary and family offices; and third, shifting our
business mix to higher value-add products such as quant active, ETF, ESG and multi-asset.
As we enter 2020, we are excited about the competitive positioning within each of our businesses. We remain
focused on providing our clients with exceptional service and expertise, driving efficiencies into our business and
driving profitable growth.
Let me turn the call over to Jason, to walk you through the details of our performance.

Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Let me join Mike and Mark in welcoming you to our fourth quarter
2019 earnings conference call.
Turning on page 2 of our quarterly earnings review presentation, this morning we reported fourth quarter net
income of $371.1 million. Earnings per share were $1.70 and our return on common equity was 14.8%. The
current quarter's results included a $20.8 million charge recorded in other operating income related to the decision
to sell substantially all of the lease portfolio and a $6.8 million software disposition charge recorded within
equipment and software expense. As you can see on the bottom of page 2, the macroeconomic environment was
mixed. While equity markets were strong, short-term interest rates in the US declined; both on a sequential as
well as year-over-year basis.
Let's move to page 3 and review the financial highlights of the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, revenue increased
3% with non-interest income up 4% from one year ago and net interest income flat. Expenses increased 5% from

last year. The provision for credit losses was a credit of $1 million in the current quarter compared to a credit of $4
million one year ago. Net income was down 9% year-over-year. In a sequential comparison, revenue increased
1% with both non-interest income and net interest income up 1%. Expenses increased 3% compared to the prior
quarter. Net income declined 3% sequentially.
Return on average common equity was 14.8% for the quarter, down from 17% one year ago and 14.9% in the
prior quarter. Assets under custody/administration of $12.1 trillion, increased 19% compared to one year ago and
were up 4% on a sequential basis. Assets under custody of $9.2 trillion were up 22% compared to one year ago
and up 5% sequentially. Assets under management were $1.2 trillion, up 15% on a year-over-year basis and up
2% on a sequential basis.
Let's look at the results in greater detail, starting with revenue on page 4. Fourth quarter revenue on a fully
taxable equivalent basis was $1.6 billion, up 3% compared to last year and up 1% sequentially. Trust, investment
and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were $992 million in the fourth
quarter, up 6% from last year and up 2% sequentially. Foreign exchange trading income was $65 million in the
fourth quarter, down 17% year-over-year and up 8% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily
related to lower foreign exchange swap activity in our treasury function.
Other non-interest income was $70 million in the fourth quarter, down 6% compared to one year ago and down
17% sequentially. Other operating income included the aforementioned $20.8 million loss relating to the lease
portfolio. Excluding the lease-related loss, the year-over-year growth was driven by implementation of a bank-
owned life insurance program during 2019 and strong security commissions and trading income. The sequential
growth, excluding the lease portfolio loss, was primarily driven by favorability in the Visa-related swap. Net
interest income, which I'll discuss in more detail later, was $430 million in the fourth quarter, flat with the prior
period and up 1% sequentially.
Now, let's look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page 5. For our Corporate & Institutional
Services business, fees totaled $567 million in the fourth quarter and were up 6% year-over-year and up 1% on a
sequential basis. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $397 million
and up 6% year-over-year and up 1% on a sequential basis. The year-over-year performance was primarily driven
by new business and favorable equity markets. Performance on a sequential basis was primarily driven by
favorable currency translation and favorable markets.
Assets under custody and administration for C&IS clients were $11.3 trillion at quarter end, up 19% year-over-
year and up 4% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential performance was primarily driven by higher
markets, new business and favorable currency translation. Recall that lag market values factor into the quarter's
fees with both quarter-lag and month-lag market impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration fees.
Investment management fees in C&IS of $116 million in the fourth quarter were up 10% year-over-year and up
1% sequentially. The year-over-year performance was driven by new business and favorable markets. The
sequential performance was primarily due to favorable markets.
Assets under management for C&IS were $917 billion, up 16% year-over-year and up 2% sequentially. The year-
over-year increase was driven by favorable markets and new business, as well as an increase in end of period
securities lending collateral levels. We've had strong success within our liquidity products with significant growth
in our institutional cash funds. The sequential increase is primarily driven by markets, partially offset by a decline
in period-end securities lending collateral levels. Securities lending fees were $22 million in the fourth quarter, up
4% year-over-year and up 12% sequentially. The year-over-year increase is primarily driven by higher volumes

while the sequential increase is primarily driven by higher spreads. Securities lending collateral was $163 billion at
quarter end and averaged $164 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels increased 4% year-over-year
and were down 7% sequentially.
Moving to our Wealth Management business, trust, investment and other servicing fees were $425 million in the
fourth quarter and were up 7% compared to the prior quarter and up 2% sequentially. Both the year-over-year and
sequential increases were driven by favorable markets and new business. Assets under management were $314
billion at quarter end, up 13% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. The increases were primarily driven by
favorable markets.
Moving on to page 6, net interest income was $430 million in the fourth quarter and flat compared to the prior
year. Earning assets averaged $107 billion in the quarter, down 4% from the prior year. Total deposits averaged
$89 billion and were down 4% versus the prior year. The net interest margin was 1.59% in the fourth quarter and
was up 7 basis points from the year ago. The improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year
primarily reflects the balance sheet mix shift and the impact of lower foreign exchange swap volume, partially
offset by lower short-term interest rates versus one year ago. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income
was up 1%.
Average earning assets increased 2% on a sequential basis while the net interest margin declined 2 basis points.
It's worth noting that net interest income results in the quarter did include approximately $6 million in various one-
time non-repeating items.
During the quarter, we also added to our bank-owned life insurance program that was first put in place during the
second quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, this quarter's net interest income declined by approximately
$900,000 as a result of the additional BOLI while other operating income benefited by $1.5 million. The full
quarterly run rate will be reached in the first quarter of 2020 with an additional net interest income decline of
approximately $2.3 million and other operating income increase of $2.7 million on a sequential basis.
Looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet, for the fourth quarter, US dollar deposits represented 68% of
our total deposits. This is down from 70% one year ago and 69% in the prior quarter.
Turning to page 7, expenses were $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter and were 5% higher than the prior year and
3% higher versus the prior quarter. Compensation expense totaled $463 million and was up 4% compared to one
year ago. The year-over-year growth was primarily related to higher salaries, driven by base pay adjustments and
staff growth, partially offset by lower incentive expense. On a sequential basis, compensation was up 1%. The
sequential increase was partially due to higher salary expense driven by staff growth and unfavorable currency
translation, partially offset by lower cash-based incentive accruals.
Employee benefit expense of $93 million was up 2% from one year ago and was up 6% sequentially. The year-
over-year growth was primarily driven by higher payroll taxes while the sequential growth was primarily due to
increased medical costs. Now, this pertains to our benefits expense in 2020. Due to changes in underlying
assumptions, we expect to see an increase in full-year pension expense of just over $30 million, which represents
a 0.7% increase in our overall total 2019 expense base.
Outside services costs of $206 million were up 5% on a year-over-year basis and up 6% sequentially. The year-
over-year growth was primarily driven by higher technical services, consulting and legal expense. The sequential
increase was primarily due to higher legal and consulting services as well as costs related to increased business
volumes, including brokerage clearing, market data, sub-custody and third-party advisor fees.

Equipment and software expense of $165 million was up 8% from one year ago and up 9% sequentially. Both the
year-over-year and sequential growth were impacted by the previously mentioned software disposition charge of
$6.8 million. The year-over-year growth also reflects higher depreciation and amortization, while higher software
amortization costs contributed to the sequential increase.
Occupancy expense of $57 million was up 15% from one year ago and up 8% sequentially. Both the year-over-
year and sequential increases were driven by higher rents and building operation costs related to our workplace
real estate strategies.
Other operating expense of $88 million was down 1% from one year ago and down 4% sequentially. The
sequential decrease was driven primarily by the Northern Trust sponsored golf tournament in the prior quarter,
partially offset by increases in advertising, staff-related and other operating expense categories.
As we've discussed on previous calls, through our Value for Spend initiative that we started in 2017, we've been
realigning our expense base with the goal of realizing $250 million in expense run rate savings by 2020. Our
current quarter results reflect approximately $60 million in expense savings or $240 million in annualized run rate
savings.
Our efforts around Value for Spend and productivity more broadly will not cease as we further embed a culture of
sustainable expense management across the company. Expense management is a core emphasis and we
continue to focus on striking the right balance between productivity, growth and investing in the business.
Now, turning to full year, our results in 2019 are summarized on page 8. Net income was $1.5 billion, down 4%
compared to 2018. And earnings per share were $6.63, flat with the prior year. On the right margin of this page,
we outlined the non-recurring impacts that were called out for both years. We achieved a return on equity for the
year of 14.9% compared to 16.2% in 2018.
The full year revenue and expense trends are outlined on page 9. Trust, investment and other servicing fees grew
3% in 2019. The growth during the year was primarily driven by new business in favorable markets, partially offset
by the impact of unfavorable currency translation. Foreign exchange trading income declined 18%, driven by a
decrease in foreign exchange swap activity within our treasury function as well as decreases in market volatility
and lower client volumes. Net interest income increased 3%. Average earning assets during the year declined by
6% while net interest margin increased 14 basis points. The net result was 2% growth in overall revenue on a
reported basis in 2019.
On a reported basis, expenses were up 3% from the prior year. Adjusting for the expense charges in both 2018
and 2019 that are on the prior page, expenses were also up 3% from 2018.
And turning to page 10, our capital ratios remain strong with our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 12.7% under the
standardized approach and 13.3% under the advanced approach. The supplementary leverage ratio at the
corporation is 7.6% and at the bank was 6.4%, both of which exceed the 3% minimum requirement.
During the fourth quarter, we declared cash dividends totaling $150 million to common stockholders and
repurchased 2.6 million shares of common stock at a cost of $264 million. These two factors combined represent
a payout ratio of approximately 113% for the quarter.

Also during the fourth quarter, Northern Trust issued $400 million in Perpetual Preferred Stock at a fixed for life
dividend rate of 4.7%, callable in five years. Fixed rate dividends for this new issuance are expected to be paid on
a quarterly basis with the first dividend declared at our board of directors meeting earlier this week and to be paid
April 1 of 2020.
Given the November issuance, the initial preferred dividend payment will cover approximately five months and
therefore is expected to equal $7.6 million in the first quarter of 2020. Going forward, these fixed rate dividends
are expected to be $4.7 million per quarter.
The proceeds of this issuance were used to redeem all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock on
January 2, 2020. First quarter 2020 results will include $11.5 million in accelerated Series C-related costs.
Now, let me turn the call back over to Mike for closing comments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Before we open up the call for Q&A, I wanted to close by talking about our key financial objectives and our
performance against these in 2019. Our primary financial target is to achieve a return on average common equity
of between 10% to 15%. For 2019, our ROE of 14.9% was at the high end of that range. This was the sixth
consecutive year we have achieved our targeted ROE.
We are also focused on driving profitable growth and have objectives to achieve both fee operating leverage and
positive operating leverage. Although we have achieved positive fee operating leverage in 8 of the last 10 years
and positive operating leverage in 7 of the last 10 years, we did not achieve those for 2019.
As we enter 2020, we are continuing to rapidly evolve the company by providing differentiated services and
experiences to our clients and investing in innovative capabilities to do more for our existing clients and gain new
clients. We combine this with our intense focus on improving our productivity to profitably grow the company and
create value for our stakeholders.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust's fourth quarter
earnings conference call today. Jason, Mark, and I would be happy to answer your questions. David, could you
please open the line?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Alex Blostein with Goldman
Sachs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, guys. Good morning, everybody. Mike, picking up on the last point, I guess when you talk about operating
leverage, I guess over the last few quarters, you guys talked about getting organic expense growth to be in line
with organic fee growth, not just total fee growth. I guess question number one there, is the organic fee growth still
in the 3% to 4% kind of range as you look out into 2020?
And then secondly, should we expect you to achieve this level of expense growth for the full year sort of despite
the fact that markets are starting off on a very strong point and that should naturally create more kind of pressure,
or more tailwinds rather to fees, and I'm just wondering whether or not this sort of level of expense growth could
be sustainable into 2020?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So Alex, I think you're thinking about the framework the right way, which is, as I mentioned earlier, we are focused
on the objective of generating positive fee operating leverage and underneath that is the goal to achieve that on
an organic basis as well, knowing that that is a higher bar, if you will. But the reason why we focus on an organic
basis is because just as you indicated, when markets are stronger, we expect that we'll get more positive fee
operating leverage from that. It's more challenging to achieve that in, I'll call it, lower growth environments than
when we do have the tailwinds. But that's why it's important to have that primary objective around organic.
In 2019, we did not achieve the organic fee operating leverage. And that's something that certainly as far as what
we're shooting for, we're trying to get that so that if we would have achieved it, we would've had positive fee
operating leverage here for the year. And going into 2020, it's the same objective.
Now, as Jason talked about and can go into more detail, there are certain aspects of the expense base that roll in.
In this case pension, as he mentioned, for example, $30 million increase to the year. We still look to cover that, if
you will, and try to just focus on the productivity objectives to try to overcome things like that as well. So the goals
haven't changed. From year to year, we can have different challenges to achieve it but as far as what we're trying
to achieve, it's the same objective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. Thanks for that. And then Jason, one cleanup for you for NIR. It sounded like there was $6 million of one-
time. I believe it was a benefit in Q4. Can you flesh that out a little bit? So what are those benefits and maybe help
us bridge the kind of the right jumping off point for Q1 2020 NIR as we [ph] zone in (00:25:22) on the quarter here.
Thanks.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
Yes, you've got the headline number right, it was about $6 million. It's a combination of a couple of different items.
There's some [ph] premium in (00:25:34). And then one thing we didn't headline much but we did have a payoff of
a loan that was on non-accrual. We picked up another $2 million in interest on that. And then the FTE adjustment
was a couple of million dollars higher. So you add those factors together and you get to the $6 million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, guys. Can we just talk a little bit about the period-end balance sheet? It really kind of spiked.
Should we take that as just sort of transitory, because if you look at average balances, they weren't up that much?
Or is there something that's continuing into 1Q that we should maybe up our assumptions around deposit growth
given Fed actions, et cetera?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. You're right. It was high. I actually looked back to see if this was a record high, it wasn't but it was close.
But more importantly, it has come back down. Obviously, as you know, the balance sheet tends to spike at the
end of the quarters and particularly the end of the years. This was higher than normal, not a record, but already
we've seen more normalization as some of the large clients have put money back to work into the market in
different ways.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Okay. Thanks. And then maybe just to follow up on the comp line and expenses going forward. Just on – you had
head count growth of 5%. So how do we think about that kind of upward pressure from head count growth versus
your desire to kind of the scalable digitization, trying to keep core expense growth below organic growth, but we're
kind of starting off with a much higher employee base? How do we think about the comp line specifically?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Well, a couple of things. And maybe you might be looking at page 7 of the press release and you get the
comp line there and I look at it more on Q4 2018 versus Q4 2019 and you got a 4% growth rate there.
So, the first thing from my lens is to say, what was revenue growth, what was really trusty growth over that
timeframe, and it was about 6.25%. So, first of all, on that comp line, even though it's a tiny bit higher than we like
to see, we did get leverage in that, which is good. And we're in a year where we got revenue up. A lot of our
revenue growth is going to bring with it expense growth and it's going to hit in just about every one of the key
expense line items including comp.
The second thing for us to think about is that in general, we've got the technology investment that we're making,
and so, part of the reason that number might be a little higher is that some of the tech investments that we're
making in the business are coming through in that comp line.
And third, just so you guys are thinking about it the right way coming into the next year, we're always going to
have effectively, call it, $30 million to $40 million base pay adjustment for the comp line. And so when you think

about that on the base of business that we have here, that's going to lead to almost a point in and of itself in the
growth. So, those are just a couple of ways, different lenses to think about that line item.

Hi. Good morning. Hi. I just wanted to follow up a little bit on that regarding just technology in general. I know in
the past you've given some insight on what your tech budget is. Maybe you could give us a little sense as to how
you see that trajecting over time, I know you ain't give guidance but just to understand, do you think that trajectory
is accelerating, decelerating and then how you see that shifting over time, comp versus non-comp, as it relates to
tech? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. So, it's obviously we've got a high sense of urgency as we think about expenses in general and tech where
it is outsized relative to the other areas. And so you're right to hone in on it. A couple of data points as you think
about next year. One is, as I take a step back, we thought about what we wanted to convey that we know about.
We don't want to give guidance on expenses, but we do want to tell you what we know at this point, and there are
some things that we have high degree of certainty of as we sit at this point coming into 2020.
So, I want to do those in three buckets, just to put those out. One, I hinted to a couple minutes ago and that
comes down to the compensation line. We know that we're going to see, in general, about – somewhere between
$35 million, $40 million just in base pay adjustments based on the business that we have. Secondly, we talked
about pension being a little over $30 million higher. And then third is we have a sense right now of what IT
depreciation is going to look like, and that's about $40 million higher for the year in 2020 than it will be as we look
back on 2019.
Now, some of that is reflected in the fourth quarter and so we can – it's hard for us to divulge much of it, but we do
know that on a [audio gap] (00:31:28) higher. So those are three key items that I think everybody – we want to
make sure everybody is aware of because we've got clear line of sight on it at this point.
And the second more broadly is we think about how do we depict the IT budget and this IT increase, it is actually
hitting in a lot of different line items. So, just we were talking about page 7 on the press release a minute ago.

Stay there for a second. And if you look at these different line items, I actually went back and pulled out IT from
each of the different components that you can see externally to get a sense of how much they're impacting those
growth areas. Because I do look at not just comp which we were talking about a second ago but all of those line
items to try and get a sense of whether we're getting leverage there.
And obviously, it hits very heavily in equipment and software, which is why you'll see that line item be pretty
elevated. But there's also smaller but still meaningful impacts that will hit in obviously compensation, employee
benefits and outside services.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And is it still around $1 billion that you're thinking the tech budget was in 2019? I recall that was the estimate that
was given most recently.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Betsy, this is Mark. Yeah. We look at it kind of in a three-year rolling average, so 2019, 2020, 2021. A little
bit over $1 billion per year and that includes both operating expense as well as capital investments.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with the Deutsche Bank.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks very much. Maybe just a question on NII. Is there any impact on future net interest income from the
sale of the leasing portfolio? And if so, if you can quantify that. And then also if you can talk about what you're
seeing for deposit trends into 1Q so far.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So, on – well, I just want to write down deposit trends, very good. On the impact of Norlease on NIM, very de
minimis increase, nothing to really think about. That's pretty clean accounting perspective on how that was set.
And then secondly, on deposit trends coming in more broadly, I know that it's first of all, it's a strategic focus for us
across the business on both the Wealth side and on the C&IS side and we've talked about on the Wealth side in
particular, we told you about some strategic initiatives we had there that brought some money out of the 2a-7
funds onto the balance sheet. That's held in pretty well.
And then, I'd say on the Institutional side of the business, it's more volatile. And there's no – the initiatives that we
have there aren't as aggressive as what we've been thinking about on the Wealth side, but we're still doing
everything we can to make sure we're getting a good share of our deposits – good deposits coming in from clients
as the custody grows and as we're talking to clients across the globe.

Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
On an averaging basis, are you expecting growth in 1Q based on those initiatives? I know the end of period was
elevated, of course, but if we think about it average-to-average.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
I think there was – if you think about the asset side and then the funding side, if you think about NIM is that the
only other item there of note, there was a little bit and a couple billion dollars higher on that, but that didn't really
come more from the deposit side. It came more from trading-related activity. And so, there's nothing I'd call out at
this point that would lead you to say that deposits would be moderately or significantly different.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then on organic growth, I think you commented on Wealth Management AUM being up mostly
from the markets. Just want to get a sense, that's been a strong driver of organic growth for you guys for a while. I
just want to get a sense of the cadence of the organic growth trends in Wealth Management versus the asset
servicing business. And as you think about expenses, are we still thinking about a comparable growth rate in
expense growth even with those headwinds that you've mentioned on the comp pension and the IT side? Is that
still reasonable to think of a rate of growth that would be similar to the organic growth if that's still trending towards
the mid-single digits?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Let me hit the top side first on the growth side and the trends within the Wealth business. The business is
continuing to do well and Mike touched on earlier, this year, there are some really nice differentiated approaches
that that business has in the market with growth here in Wealth Management resonates very well.
As the trend there that continues to be seen and come through on the financials and you guys are able to see this
actually that we're doing well at the very top end of the market. So the family office business is growing faster and
you can see that in the numbers we report on both a sequential basis and a year-over-year basis. That trend has
been going on for a while and it's attractive.
And then the second component to how we'll see the expenses line differently between the business, I'm going to
separate it in a couple of ways. One is that the tech-related expenses apply a little bit more toward the C&IS side
of the business. As we think about things like Matrix and our strategic operating model, those things are going to
be allocated a little bit more toward the C&IS side of the business. That said, the Wealth side of the business is
also investing in different ways, and they're working hard on digitizing the business. Mike talked about that earlier
that we're probably a little ahead in our investments there on the C&IS side. Wealth is starting to think more about
how to reflect the digital transformation that we've seen across the marketplace and how we can take our position
with things like [indiscernible] (00:38:00) and Wealth Management make it even more accessible to clients, have
even better interactions and have better foundational technology.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And we're still thinking about organic growth in that sort of mid-single digit area on a go-forward basis, low- to mid-
single digit?

Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Brian, just to confirm, are you talking about Wealth or the corporation as a whole?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
The company as a whole.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. So maybe just to address that, Brian, kind of across the businesses. So, Jason talked about Wealth
Management. We continue to see, as you mentioned, healthy solid growth in that business. That's the nature of it.
And again, our strategic imperative in that business is to increase or accelerate that growth even more. We're still
seeing a higher growth rate in our asset servicing business and so that continues. It's at the lower end of its
range, but it continues to grow at a healthy rate. And the strategic imperative for that business is we have to
continue that growth, but we want to see that growth be more scalable.
And then, I would just also add, with our asset management business, we're all well aware of the secular trends in
the industry there. And I would say that certainly impacted our asset management business although
comparatively, the business is performing well and so it's experiencing positive organic growth, just meaning
they're able to increase the flows but also then change the mix in such a way that it is offsetting the fee
compression that you're seeing across the industry.
So, it's positive. Having said that, it is at a lower rate than the other two businesses. So you put that all together,
to your point, we've talked about the organic growth rate for our fees at the company level kind of being mid-single
digits. That's still the case. We're at the lower end of that right now. So what does that mean? Well, that's why
we're focused on our growth strategies and executing on those. But that's why one of our other key priorities for
the company is on continually improving our productivity.
And when we are at the lower end of the growth side, we have to work just that much harder on the expense side
to get more savings, if you will, on the expense side. So that's the strategy, if you will, and, again, focused on
trying to execute that so that we can deliver the positive fee operating leverage.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks a lot. Hey, Jason, can you expand a little bit more on – underneath the fact that you said that some of the
balances might have gone off the balance sheet, can you help us understand either how much you saw as, like,
the overgrowth in the earning assets this quarter?
And then secondarily, if rates stay stable from here, can you talk us through the dynamics of NIM in terms of how
much asset repricing has to come through and how much deposit repricing you can still see happen now that
we've gone to a more stable level? Thanks.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So, on the first, I think as these spikes happened late in the quarter, it's frankly a relatively short period of
time that these spikes are on the balance sheet. And so it comes in late and it leaves pretty early. And we're not
doing anything fancy when those dollars come in. And so, frankly, it just doesn't impact the overall NIM very
much. It does spike the – we obviously look through the balance sheet on a daily basis, it spikes it, but it doesn't –
I don't think it really drives NIM that much at the end of the day.
And then as we look out into next quarter, I don't think that spike should necessarily be reflected in your thought
process as you think about – so that's more from a volume perspective. Although I did hint earlier that kind of that
$2 billion increase in the securities portfolio, I do think that's likely to come down. And that had more to do with, I
think more idiosyncratic trading that was happening at the time, nothing abnormal. We're trading some more
longer-dated securities and the securities settlement process led to higher securities being on. And that's really
what led to that little bit of an average increase and I think that'll abate.
As we think about the rates going forward into first quarter, the thing that we can all see that we'll have maybe
more of an impact than what people realize is that Fed funds the LIBOR spread. And that did have an impact in
fourth quarter. And when we talk to everyone at the conference we attended and then on the last call, we were
looking at spread, there's more probably 13 or 14 basis points. And we thought that was going to go away. It
actually held in, it even expanded a little bit. But now that compression that we anticipated has actually come to
fruition. And if you look at that delta right now, it's more on the 9, 10 basis point land. And so that is a factor that –
if that holds in that would have an impact on what we would think about for NIM for next quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And then do you have the ability to reprice much on the right side of the balance sheet? Can you just talk to
us about customer dynamics outside of just market index type of deposits? Like, how's the discussion going with
clients and what opportunities do you still have to reduce rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Just so incredibly different between the businesses. And so on the Institutional side, first of all, the deposits
there are driven a lot more by our EMEA clients. And in that book, those clients are shopping in real time. And so
we're making very tight decisions on those and we're going to get what the market gives us frankly. And we're not
in a position to be a price leader there.
Now, on the other side of the business, the Wealth business, very different dynamics. And there we talk again
about the fact that we sunsetted an anchor suite product and we brought assets from the 2a-7 funds out of the
balance sheet. We're looking much more there and can think about what we want to be strategically in the
marketplace.
And to give you some headlines on how we talk about it. We want to be very attractive for large depositors. And
so that's where we're going to be much more competitive. And for more of the retail client base, we're going to be
less competitive. But at the top end of the market there, we're always trying to figure out how to attract and be
extremely aggressive about retaining our top depositors.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
So just wanted to start off with a question on capital. I know that in the past you've discussed the business need
to manage to higher ratios, to ensure you don't deviate meaningfully at least from some of your GSIB peers that
are running closer to 12%-plus, given that you're competing with some of these firms for RFPs.
And I was hoping you could maybe just unpack or speak to some of the competitive considerations such as RFPs
versus regulatory constraints. It looks like the regulatory changes are swinging in the right way in terms of SLR
relief, potential for the elimination of leverage constraints in CCAR. I'm just wondering if some of those changes
come through, how that informs your willingness or appetite to manage to a lower target over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
It's Mike. Why don't I start off. So, first of all, as you would expect, we feel very good about our capital levels and
our flexibility with regards to capital. As you've highlighted, we are always cognizant and focused on what the
implications would be on the business for our capital levels, and that can play into formalized RFP processes
where, yes, we want to compare favorably to some of our competitors. But also just more broadly and I'll say even
subjectively with our Wealth Management business, dealing with large family offices, they are looking for safety
and security, conservative, strong balance sheet. And so, it's a part of the business strategy for us.
Having said that, like any resource, it needs to be balanced. And so we're comfortable with where we are. To your
point, we're cognizant of where our competitor capital levels are, and to the extent that those move, that gives us
more flexibility on that front.
And then the last thing I would add is from a regulatory lens, as you've talked about, there are changes on the
regulatory front. Having said that, they've also recently re-categorized banks. We're a Category 2 bank. We
happen to be the only Category 2 bank, which we take as a compliment, reflecting the unique nature of our
business model. But it also does mean, once again, we have to work our way through whatever changes that may
mean as far as capital management for us. We're not concerned about anything per se, but there just is some
uncertainty until they fully roll out the implications of Category 2 on capital management expectations.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
No, very helpful color. And just one follow-up for me, just a clean-up question on the other income line. Even
when we adjust for the one-timers in the quarter, it looks like that was a source of revenue strength, and I was
hoping to gauge the sustainability of some of that strength versus the $50 million core level in 4Q. And just given
some of the guidance on BOLI-related impacts, how we should think about – what could be a reasonable or
appropriate run rate for that line in 2020, recognizing there's always mark-to-market and other noise?

Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Steven, hi. It's Mark. As you said, if you adjust for the lease, we would have been at closer to the $50 million
mark. There was – the BOLI benefit came into that line. That will continue to have a little bit of a bump up in the
first quarter, like Jason said.
I would say that the mark-to-market adjustment on the [indiscernible] (00:49:05) was favorable this quarter, about
a $5 million sequential benefit, which there was more of a negative drag on that last quarter for some of the
adjustments that we made there. This quarter, when you take that into account as well as the BOLI, we did have a
little bit higher miscellaneous income and credit and bank-related fees, probably higher than normal. One way that
I would say that you can look at that line, because it does move around, is if you do strip out some of the non-
recurring items that we've had in that line, you're probably looking at an average of about $35 million over the last
several quarters. And then, in theory, you could layer BOLI on top of that. That would be one way to look at it.

Hi, Brennan.

Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just had a follow-up from a few of the questions that have
been asked so far, and just wanted to try and frame it in the best way to think about 1Q NII. And Jason, I know –
welcome to the circus, our quarterly circus here with your first call. I know your predecessor had started to help us
think about one quarter out NII. I know that was a departure from Northern's normal course of business. I don't
know what your plan is going forward, but it does seem like there's a lot of noise.
So, if you could help us frame how to think about 1Q. You guys sold some of the lease portfolio. So, I'm guessing
we need to shrink that average earning asset bucket a bit. We've got an overearning of about $6 million. You've
got the tighter Fed fund to LIBOR. How should we think about how all this will weigh on NII as we go into 1Q
based on what you've seen so far?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Right. Well, Brennan, I think you got all the pieces. The way I think about leaning into it, another couple items.
One, you talked about the one-timers of – it's really $5 million, $6 million. Secondly, I mentioned the LIBOR to Fed
fund spread. I think that's a very important one as you think about how to model this out.

And then you mentioned BOLI, which having that in place now for a full quarter because, remember, we didn't
have it in place last year. The benefit of that, even if you just assume the same type of economics that we
experienced this time, should be a positive $5 million. And then lastly, we haven't talked about day count is going
to work against us if you're thinking about that on a sequential basis. Will go from 92 – not to 90, but to 91 with
leap year. But those are the – in my mind, those are the big four buckets to use as a starting point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks for that. And then, when we think about the average balance sheet, it looked like there was a bit of
a jump in the other liabilities this quarter and it's at the highest level that it's been in a couple of years by about $1
billion. Is that temporary? Obviously, it was enough to skew the average balance for the fourth quarter. So, is
there something unusual happening that will prove sustainable or should we just expect that to wind down in 1Q?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
That's us hinting at earlier that it had to do with more the nature of the securities we were trading that had more
time and were in settlement mode for longer. And so, that's what I think will drive, bringing that – the securities
portfolio down to a more normalized level.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay, like TBAs or something?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Could be ABS, TBAs and mortgages. Nothing we don't normally do, just with a little higher mix of those items that
led to higher level of security sitting. And obviously, we're not getting the yield on those as they're sitting and [ph]
settling (00:53:35). The other thing I'd just mention, I think it's – yeah, you're right. There is kind of a lot of
question about where NIM is going. And we had gotten in a mode of talking about what we expect and effectively
providing guidance.
And I'll say, at this point we do think NIM will be down 2% to 4%, but – NII will be down 2% to 4%. And so, it's not
to say that every quarter we're going to give that. But I do think with – we gave you guys a handful of different
items that you had to square off to get a good launch point. And so, I think putting it out there this quarter is fair.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Terrific. And that's off the reported number in 4Q, right, the $107 billion, what we should base that minus
2% to 4%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A

Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Don't want to focus too much on one year, but when you look at the – like not
hitting the off-leverage target, was that more of a function of higher necessary investments that came up during
the year, or was it lighter organic growth than maybe you expected? And since you mentioned some of the
expense items heading into 2020 on comp, pension and tech, are there any areas like maybe real estate that you
could see some savings given some of the repositioning that you guys have been working on?

Yeah. I'll start with the second, which – we have mentioned that we expect occupancy to be higher in the short
run as we got some double lease – double rent payments that we have effectively. And so, those who have been
exposed to it were going through a transition of very large number of seats from a building we've been in for a
long time in Chicago to a new building. We're starting to move people in this month. A lot of the move is going to
take place next month.
And so, we're right in the midst of that. And so, you can imagine we're still obviously paying rent in the old facility
and also we've started a new facility. There's a lot of work that goes around making sure that move is taking
place. And there are other areas around the footprint overall from a real estate perspective that's going to lead to
a higher level of rent in the first half of this year.
Now, in the second half of the year, we should get some benefits from that. And so, that's something that we'll
actually see come down. We'll eventually grow into that run rate, but we're expecting to actually see that line
come down in the second half of the year. Mike, anything you want to add to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Just to the first part of your question there about the year, and again it is a year, but part of the trend there.
And so, what came out of that? One, much broader perspective pulling back from it is, if you look at our expense
base overall, I'm going to call them technology expenses. So, this is the expenses for our technology group and
the IT depreciation and amortization represents about 20% of our cost base and that grew at 8%. If you look at
the other 80% of our cost base, it grew at about 2%.
And so, I would say, across that 80%, for the most part we hit on the costs related to the business to bringing on
new clients; and importantly, hitting on our Value for Spend initiative and the objectives there. So, it's not that we
didn't achieve those. And then you say, well, on the technology side, what happened there. And there if you think
about technology or as I think about technology, there's three primary things that we're trying to achieve there.
One is security; two is stability; and three is scalability within our technology.
And if you look at the costs that were related to that in the year, they were costs that we had on the safety and
stability part which ended up being higher than we would have expected going into the year, but are things that
you absolutely do in order to make sure that you are being able to provide the value proposition, if you will, for
your clients. And then likewise on the scalability, there are certain aspects of that where the greater demand for,
I'll call it, just computing power, if you will, on the part of our large asset manager clients, on some of the asset
owner clients, we're just in an environment where there's greater activity and we didn't achieve the level of, I
would say, scalability on our platform that we need to be able to achieve.
So with each of those three, not only are we trying to ensure we have a strong, safe, stable, secure platform, but
we want to increase the scalability on that. So, a lot of the focus of our technology strategy beyond kind of
digitizing the business and providing new capabilities for our clients is also saying, how do we also get greater
productivity out of that platform.

Okay. That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up. Tax rate was a little bit lower. You guys mentioned some of the
drivers. Jason, any like change in terms of the range that you guys typically expect when we think about going
forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A

I'll start. This quarter had some impact even from [indiscernible] (00:59:47) some other small items, none of which
in and of themselves worth calling out. But I don't think you should expect us to be at this 22% level. And we
talked – I think Biff mentioned last time in the call, it's something in the 24%. I do think 24% is a better longer-term
assumption at this point.

Robert Wildhack Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Morning, guys. On the C&IS business, can you give us an update on what you're seeing in the competitive
landscape and on the pricing front? And then, maybe more broadly, when you think about the conversations
you're having with clients, but those discussions changed in tone or content at all recently, and how would you
expect them to evolve going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. I'd be glad to talk about it. So, there is a tremendous amount of activity in C&IS broadly and specifically, I
would say, asset servicing. And I would say, a lot of these changes – well, certainly they create challenges. We're
very optimistic about the growth opportunities that are out there. So if you just give me a minute to run across
that, I think I can address some of these trends that you're looking for.
So if we think about asset owners, even in the parts of the asset owner space that you might think about as being
more stable in just their operating models, they have greater needs and greater needs certainly lead to more
opportunities for us. So if you think about the not-for-profit sector, healthcare is an area that continues to grow
and presents opportunities for us to manage the assets of large healthcare organizations. Universities where you
have endowments and also the foundation space, they've increased the mix on the investment side to greater use
of alternatives; and as a result, they have greater needs for how they manage those portfolios and those
managers. And that's why we've invested in and are rolling out, what we call, front-office solutions because that
gives them the capability to do that.
If you look in Australia, for example, some of the large superannuation funds, not only has that been a great
growth opportunity for us over the last decade, but likewise you're seeing consolidation within the superannuation

complex, which again presents changes in the marketplace and opportunities for us. And the last thing I would
say in the asset owner space is, more of the very large sophisticated clients. So if you think about the sovereign
wealth funds, are actually insourcing some of the asset management as opposed to allocating it all out to asset
managers. What that requires is they may need to have the capabilities to operate as asset managers. So they
have greater data needs and the nature and timing of what they need is greater. And so, that provides
opportunities for us. That drives a lot of the investments that you hear about, because it's now putting them in a
different position.
And then if I shift to the asset management space, we talk a lot about the pressure of the secular trends and we
feel that in our asset management business as well. But it does create opportunities for us on the asset servicing
side, because it causes these asset managers to look at every aspect of their business including the operations
side. And so, that presents opportunities for us where they're looking to outsource more activities. Now
historically, as you know, that's meant mostly middle office and what we do in IOO. We are seeing more of those
types of opportunities in the marketplace. But there are also some new activities that previously were just largely
done in-house by everybody that they're now saying why should they do those and should it be part of their
outsourcing solution.
So if you think about the trading side where we have integrated trading solutions, that's really an outsource
trading service that we would provide to them, that enables them to essentially move something that's not core to
them and that we can do it better and more efficiently for them, and there are other opportunities like that. I would
also just continue with the asset managers to the alternative space where, for years, the hedge fund space has
presented growth opportunities for us. Our hedge fund services business continues to grow nicely, win large
mandates. You saw this last year. But then also, for us, in the other parts of the alternative space, so thinking
private equity, infrastructure, real estate, those are areas where we've had less of a market share or market
position there, but it presents larger growth opportunities for us going forward.
So, overall, a high level of activity and that's why when we talk about the growth – we're optimistic about the
growth and we just want to make sure that we're able to bring that on in a scalable way so that we get very
profitable growth in the business.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. Good point. And there's no doubt clients want more for less, and that cuts across all parts of that sector
there. So, we look at the fee pressure in the asset servicing business as just ongoing. So we don't necessarily
see, it's a repricing cycle per say that starts and then ends and then we don't do anything; it's ongoing for us. And
that's part of the organic growth equation. So, we're always netting out the – not only if we lose the client or they
drop a service, but also if there's repricing that happens in order to maintain the client.
Now the other aspect of that which is just a dynamic with that business is, because large portions of it are based
on the asset levels, that pricing is based on the asset levels. And so, as you see greater appreciation in the
market then that does mean, yes, we get the benefit where the fees go up, but that's then when you see greater
fee pressure. So, it's terrific for us that the markets are going up. It does then create more focus on the parts of
the client base to look at their fees. And that's why, overall, what we're trying to do is balance that, but also
broaden these relationships to do more for them so that they're still – very profitable relationships overall.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
And as you're trying to build all of these areas and as you said you need the tech capabilities for that, is there
room to bend the growth rate of that tech spend a little bit or not quite yet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
We believe that there is. Mark talked earlier about, when we think about our tech spend you have the expense
side of it, which we focus a lot on here and we talk a lot. Jason's mentioned the increased amortization costs that
come through. Well, the other piece of that is that CapEx piece that Mark mentioned, which is – the capitalization
of those costs happened now. They manifest themselves in expenses later.
And that's an area where – not only we've been focused, but I think there's much more opportunity when you think
about how technology is developed these days to be able to do it in a more cost efficient way. I think you're all
familiar with agile and other methodologies. Well, we're deploying those, but it's still in the earlier stages. That in
my mind will produce savings that first hits through more efficient capital spend and then later over time it results
in lower amortization.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. One more, if I may, on the funding side. Your non-interest bearing deposits did pretty well. They actually
turned around and grew again in the fourth quarter. And conversely, your short-term borrowings have been
shrinking over the course of 2019. So, can you comment on both those? Have non-interest bearing deposits
basically turned and should be drawing? Or what's your outlook of that and what are you planning to do with
short-term borrowings?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. On the demand deposits, we did see an increase sequentially, Vivek. I don't think that we're calling this an
inflection point. We've talked before over the last several quarters. We do have, especially I would say on the
institutional side, fluctuations that occur quarter-to-quarter with clients either positioning their assets on or off
balance sheet depending on what they might be doing with their own capital investing. So, I don't know that we
would call out a specific new trend on demand deposits here starting with what we just saw in the fourth quarter.
We'll have to see how that plays out over several quarters.
And on the short-term borrowing side, I would say there that is a – if you look back a year ago, three, four, five
quarters ago, I would say that some of the discretionary leveraging that we are doing within the treasury area was
running at a higher level. And now at this point over the last couple of quarters, we've kind of had that down at a
lower level. And that manifests itself both in wholesale deposits on the non-US office line, but also in those short-
term borrowings. So, it's really just a function of the leveraging opportunity to kind of gross up the balance sheet.
The trade there isn't at the tripping point where we would actually go through with that, so we've kind of reduced
some of that discretionary leveraging that we do.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
So, I'd like to talk about expenses, but kind of with the growth you guys can deliver on the top line, I tend to think a
little more of kind of margins. In 2019, [ph] ex items (01:10:55) saw kind of our first pre-tax margin compression in
what's been a number of years. Looking to 2020 and given that you need to keep investing and the current rate
environment and with kind of organic fee growth is near the bottom end of the kind of range, should we expect a
return to margin expansion in 2020 even with those kind of things facing us?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. I'll start. Before we get to the pre-tax margin, yeah, we're looking at our expenses relative to our fees. And
the reason why we do that is just the nature of the expenses and how they're lined up against the different
revenue streams. And so, there's no question, because we're focused on positive fee operating leverage. That's
because we're saying we want to bring down that ratio first. And on that front, again, it's affected by markets and
other things, but that's why we focus on the organic part because we want to be able to drive that down.
Then if you go to the pre-tax margin, yes, some of that flows through. But as you know then, it gets much more
impacted by what's happening with the other revenues, to some extent things like FX and the other income lines,
but mostly net interest income. And we're trying to provide what we see in the marketplace as far as deposits and
deposits pricing and things like that and quarter-by-quarter. That gives you some indication of, as we know from
not only last year, but every year, it's really hard to project interest rates and that's a big factor that drives in it, and
it's also tough at times to predict client deposit activity and that drives in it.
So, that's just saying, it's not that we aren't focused on positive operating leverage as well; it's just there are more
factors that frankly are out of our control and even difficult to forecast to be able to answer a question of like, well,
then is your pre-tax margin going to go up or down. We certainly are aiming for it to go up, but there are things
that are out of our control.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffery J. Harte Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
So if we think of kind of the interest rate environment holding stable and some of the market stuff like FX trading
not really declining, these pre-tax margin kind of expansion is potentially attainable?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Depending on the environment, you're right, it can make it more difficult or it can give us a tailwind.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffery J. Harte Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And secondly, with the preferred issuance and redemption, can you just review what kind of we should be
thinking about the net impact on preferred dividends [ph] next year (01:13:33)? I know there's some weird stuff in
the first quarter but then even after that what kind of run rate we should be looking at.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Hi, Jeff. It's Mark. Yeah. So when you look at – if you look back at what our prepared remarks were, the new
Series E will have essentially, call it, a five-month dividend in the first quarter which would be $7.6 million. There's
also some costs from Series C that we would also need to recognize upon redeeming it in the first quarter. So,
that's $11.5 million. And then we have the Series D which you see in the first and third quarter of each year.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
So if you take all that into consideration, at this point our expectation is you're probably looking at a preferred
dividend right around $30 million, $30.5 million in the first quarter. And then in the second quarter, you come
down to the normal new dividend for Series E which is $4.7 million and that would be the new run rate in the
quarter where we don't have the Series C. Hopefully that helps. We could talk through it offline if you'd like.

Brian Kleinhanzl Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Hey. Morning. Just a quick question on all these expenses. I mean, you have a normal expense
investment that you're doing. Was the three items that you laid out; the pension expense, the base pay adjust and
the IT depreciation, included in that growth rate already? Are you saying that you're investing, and then you have
to still consider these three additional items that are going to be on top of it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Portion of it. So, the base pay adjustments are – that's always factored into how we think about our expectations
for expense growth. The pension is obviously anomalous and that's one that – it's not forecast. And Mike
mentioned earlier we're not ignoring it; we still want to do everything we can to get leverage in that. And then the
depreciation increase, we've known that we're going be leaning into more IT spend in the short run at least. And
so, I'd say the base pay adjustments fully factored in to our long-term assumptions. The pension not, but we're
still working hard to try to even cover that. And then the third element of IT depreciation and part of that's already
in the run rate. And so, that's the key element there.
But the increase itself is one – we have to own it and we've got to – there is a high sense of urgency about
making sure we get leverage across each of the key expense items including equipment and software at some
point. That's going to be difficult to do in the near term given what we're trying to do strategically. But certainly, the
[ph] BPA (01:16:32) and a portion of the depreciation reflected in our long-term expectations.

Okay. And then separately, in the asset management I hear again that the organic growth not kind of where you
want it to be. I mean, at what point do you need to do something bigger with regards to restructuring the unit or
taking more strategic actions there? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
I think within the asset management sector that our asset management business is performing very well. We talk
about the environment a lot just because it is going through secular change. But if you just looked at the
competitive positioning, if you looked at the growth relative to others and then you look at the profitability, it's
performing well. And I would say, strategically, we feel very good about how the business is repositioning itself.
And what I mean by that is we've been strong and had scale in certain areas like liquidity, like index for a long
time. And what we've been doing over the last few years is repositioning towards some of the higher growth but
also more value-added areas which I talked about. So quant, ESG, things like that. And so those areas, although
they represent a smaller portion of the pie, if you will, they are growing, they are resonating. But like any longer-
term strategy, it takes time before you see the impact of that from a financial perspective.
But as far as thinking bigger, if you will, I would say, we are – and I just talked about, I'll call it, the product side of
that. We're also looking – not looking at, but have been executing on the strategy on the distribution side as well.
And it's going well, I would say, on the institutional side. You saw that not only in the fourth quarter, but the
second half of the year where that's gone well. But then you also saw last year that we acquired a business that is
very small, but – which is essentially a technology platform which we are utilizing in the intermediary space. And
we think, again, that's the type of capability that will enable us to accelerate the growth rate that we already have
within there. So, yes, secular change, but we feel very good about our strategic position in there.
