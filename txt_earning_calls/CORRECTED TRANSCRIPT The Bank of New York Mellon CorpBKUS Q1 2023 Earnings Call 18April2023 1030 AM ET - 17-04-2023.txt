MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the 2023 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call hosted by BNY
Mellon. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer
session. Please note that this conference call and webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted

Marius Merz
Head-Investor Relations, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2023 earnings call. As always,
we will reference our Financial Highlights presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our
website at bnymellon.com.
I'm joined by Robin Vince, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Dermot McDonogh, our Chief Financial
Officer. Robin will start with introductory remarks and Dermot will then take you through the earnings
presentation. Following their remarks, there will be a Q&A session.
Before we begin, please note that our remarks include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures.
Information about these statements and non-GAAP measures are available in the Earnings Press Release,
Financial Supplement and Financial Highlights presentation, all available on the Investor Relations page of our
website. Forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, April 18, 2023, and will not be
updated.
With that, I will turn it over to Robin.

Robin Vince
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Thank you, Marius, and good morning, everyone. Before I turn the call over to Dermot to review our financial
results, I want to provide some broader perspective and an update on how we're serving our clients, stepping up
as a firm in this complex environment.
Following a relatively benign start to the year, markets were quite unsettled in March, when we saw two prominent
bank failures in the United States and a government broker distressed bank takeover in Europe. While things
have calmed down somewhat over the past couple of weeks, after over a decade of zero interest rate monetary
policies, the risks and uncertainty associated with the fights against inflation, higher interest rates and quantitative
tightening, together with geopolitical tensions remain elevated. And domestically, we continue to march closer to
another debt ceiling standoff.
Against this backdrop, it's a healthy reminder that the strength of BNY Mellon's highly liquid, lower credit-risk and
well-capitalized balance sheet, in combination with the resilience of our platforms is the bedrock that supports our
client franchise.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
For nearly 240 years, we've built up a legacy of client and industry trust rooted in our resiliency through good
times and bad. We've been a port in the storm for our clients in periods of stress over that time, and recent weeks
have been no different as we've helped our clients to navigate the volatility in markets with our strong balance
sheet and broader liquidity solutions.
After seeing deposit balances increase following recent market events, we ended the quarter slightly higher than
where we started it. And our broader liquidity platform, which manages over $1.3 trillion worth of cash and other
short-term investment options on behalf of our clients, has seen growth across most channels.
But, more broadly, the recent events have led to concern around the health and stability of some banks as they've
highlighted the critical importance of robust asset and liability management for all financial services participants.
As one of the largest banks in the United States and as a G-SIB, we are held and we hold ourselves to a high
standard, including stringent capital, liquidity and stress testing requirements.
On capital, unrealized losses related to our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio are already reflected
in our capital ratios. We have consistently maintained the majority of our investment securities portfolio as
available-for-sale.
And as you will recall, we've had a view for a while now that rates would be a little higher in their terminal rate
than the market has been pricing in. And so, over the last year-and-a-half, we meaningfully reduced the duration
and enhanced the risk and liquidity profile of the portfolio. Together, these actions provide us with ample flexibility
to adjust to changing market conditions as we move through the year.
And on liquidity, our robust liquidity management framework includes risk metrics such as concentration limits and
daily liquidity stress testing protocols that go beyond regulatory requirements. It is these periods of stress that
also showcase our characteristic resilience and the power of our diversified and lower-risk business model. We
primarily serve large institutional clients who collectively maintain substantial deposit balances with us as part of
the services we provide to support their business activities, whether that's custody, cash management, clearing
and corporate trust services. As a result, roughly two-thirds of our deposit base is operational and sticky in nature
and derived from a diverse set of business lines.
And as I mentioned earlier, we manage over $1 trillion of cash on behalf of our clients across deposits, money
market funds, repos, and securities lending, which allows us to retain a connection to the money when it moves
around various short-term investment alternatives.
And we're also the largest provider of collateral services globally. Our average tri-party balances increased to $5.6
trillion this quarter, which is another example of just how comprehensive our role is in the broader liquidity
ecosystem.
Now, turning to our financial performance in the quarter. As you can see on page 2 of our Financial Highlights
presentation, we delivered solid results. We reported earnings per share of $1.12, up 30% year-over-year or up
20%, excluding notable items, primarily in the first quarter of last year.
Revenue was up 11% year-over-year. We closely managed expenses, up 3% year-over-year, and we generated
a healthy return on tangible common equity of 20%. And given how in focus capital and liquidity are at the
moment, I'll note that our Tier 1 leverage ratio as well as our liquidity coverage ratio remains strong and
unchanged compared to the prior quarter, well above regulatory requirements and our own management buffers.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
Stepping back for a moment, I'm encouraged by the early progress that we are seeing around the company to
deliver on the commitment that we made to you back in January. First, we are bending the cost curve. Our first
quarter expense growth came in marginally better than our initial internal plan and we remain firmly committed to
cutting our core expense growth by roughly half this year compared to 2022 on a constant currency basis.
Second, in line with our outlook for the year, we continued to derive healthy growth in net interest revenue. Third,
we delivered positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. And fourth, we returned a meaningful amount
of capital to our shareholders, including $1.3 billion of common share repurchases.
We've made good initial progress on our plan to return more than 100% of earnings to shareholders in 2023, and
we currently expect to continue buying back stock, albeit at a slower pace given the uncertain environment. At the
same time, I've made a promise to you to call it as it is when we fall short of our expectations. And so,, to be
candid, our fees being flat year-over-year, was somewhat lackluster.
Having said that, there were a number of business highlights this quarter that are designed to help us change this
trajectory and drive underlying fee growth over time. And so, I'll call out a few.
In Asset Servicing, the pipeline remains strong and the margin on new deals is improving as we're increasingly
holding the line on price to drive more profitable growth in the business. ETF activity is up across all measures
with healthy increases in AUC/A, orders and flows. And wins with Alts and in our Data Platform Services business
were pleasing to see this quarter.
In January, we announced the launch of our Outsourced Trading business, powered by a platform that already
executes more than $1 trillion in volumes annually for our Investment Management business. This global multi-
asset trading service can help clients to reduce their costs and focus on alpha generation. While still early days,
we think there is significant opportunity here to offer front office trading capabilities in a trusted, unconflicted way
to the market.
Pershing brought in a healthy $37 billion of net new assets during the quarter, representing mid-single-digit
organic growth on an annualized basis, and total revenue was a quarterly record. As part of BNY Mellon, clients
recognize Pershing as a source of strength and stability in the marketplace. In the current environment, clients
also appreciate the flexibility and choice of our product offering.
Meanwhile, our Pershing X team continues to make great progress as we aim for a broader rollout this summer.
Just last week, we announced a collaboration with Snowflake to provide our prospective Pershing X clients with
more powerful analytics and faster data management, improving their digital experience, so they can operate
more efficiently.
Clearance and Collateral Management activity remained elevated, given the volatility in the market and as dealers
increasingly finance larger inventories via tri-party. We continue to see growth from the investments that we've
made to increase market connectivity by expanding our tri-party platform into new markets across Asia and
EMEA, and into new trade types and collateral pools, reinforcing our role as the only truly global provider of
collateral management.
Treasury Services delivered broad-based client wins across US dollar, digital and FX payments, Liquidity and
Trade Finance products and also saw a nice pickup in account and operational deposit growth towards the end of
the quarter.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
In Investment and Wealth Management, although our investment performance remained solid, AUM flows were
mixed with strength in fixed income and LDI strategy, partly offset by outflows in other long-term strategies.
During the quarter, our UK investment manager, Newton, launched five FutureLegacy funds; its first range of risk-
rated sustainable multi-asset funds to support growth in the UK retirement market. And back in the US, the
Dreyfus BOLD share class, which we introduced last year, has now raised over $4 billion in AUM.
In summary, over the past few months, I've spoken about our combination of client trust, at-scale platforms, client-
focused culture, and resilience as a powerful foundation on which we can build.
I'm also proud that our culture has been front and center in recent weeks as our people have risen to the
occasion, responding commercially and working tirelessly to enable successful outcomes for our clients in these
uncertain times. I view this client-first culture as the key to make more out of our diversified portfolio of adjacent
businesses.
While we are the world's largest custodian and a trust bank, the contributions from Clearance and Collateral
Management, Pershing, Treasury Services and Issuer Services are differentiating in our client value proposition.
With that, let me officially welcome Dermot to his first earnings call. Dermot, over to you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dermot William McDonogh
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Thank you, Robin, for the introduction, and good morning, everyone. It's a privilege to be here, and I look forward
to working with you all. I'll start on page 3 of the presentation with some additional details on our consolidated
financial results in the first quarter.
Total revenue was $4.4 billion, up 11% year-over-year. This reflects fee revenue being flat as headwinds from
lower market value, a stronger dollar, and the sale of Alcentra, which closed in November last year, were offset by
significant improvement in fee waivers and the absence of a notable item last year related to Russia.
Firm-wide assets under custody and/or administration of $46.6 trillion increased by 2% year-over-year. Growth
from new and existing clients more than offset the stiff headwinds from lower market values and currency
translation, a real testament to the strength and diversification of our franchise.
Quarter-over-quarter, assets under custody and/or administration increased by 5%. Assets under management of
$1.9 trillion decreased by 16% year-over-year. Here, the impact of lower market values and the stronger dollar
was tempered by cumulative net inflows over the 12 months. Quarter-over-quarter, assets under management
increased by 4%.
Investment and other revenue was $79 million and included another strong quarter of fixed income trading on the
back of elevated volatility and greater demand for US Treasuries. And net interest revenue increased by 62%
year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher interest rates.
Expenses were up 3%, driven by higher investments and revenue-related expenses, partially offset by efficiency
savings and the impact of the sale of Alcentra. The impact of inflation and merit increases were largely offset by
the favorable impact of the stronger dollar. And the provision for credit losses was $27 million in the quarter,
reflecting changes in the macroeconomic forecast.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
As Robin mentioned earlier, earnings per share were $1.12, up 30% year-over-year or up 20% excluding notable
items largely in the first quarter of last year. Our reported pre-tax margin was 28% and our return on tangible
common equity was 20%, the highest in three years.
Turning to capital and liquidity on page 4. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio, which continues to be our binding capital
constraint, was 5.8%, essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, and our CET1 ratio was 11%. The strength of our
balance sheet and our healthy earnings generation in the quarter allowed us to return $1.6 billion of capital to our
common shareholders, including $1.3 billion of common share repurchases, while maintaining our capital ratios
well above regulatory minimum and above our more stringent management target. Similarly, on liquidity, our
liquidity coverage ratio was 118%, also unchanged compared with the prior quarter.
The strength of our highly liquid, lower credit-risk and well-capitalized balance sheet is one of the cornerstones of
our franchise. Starting in late-2021 and throughout 2022, we proactively reduced the duration and enhanced the
risk and liquidity profile of our investment securities portfolio, while consistently keeping over 60% of the book
available-for-sale to position ourselves with ample flexibility for changing market and interest rate conditions.
Between the beginning of this year and early March, we saw deposit balances decline in line with typical seasonal
patterns and in line with our expectations, considering continued central bank tightening by both rate hikes and
quantitative tightening. This was followed by a swift increase in deposit balances as clients sought the strength of
our balance sheet during the recent turmoil in the banking sector. We ended the quarter with deposit balances up
1% sequentially on a period-end basis, but we expect continued moderation of deposit levels in the months
ahead.
Now, moving on to net interest revenue and further details on the underlying balance sheet trends on Page 5,
which I will describe in sequential terms. Net interest revenue of $1.1 billion was up 7% quarter-over-quarter. This
sequential increase reflects higher yields on interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher funding costs and
the impact of balance sheet size and mix. While this is clearly a very volatile quarter in rates markets, it is worth
noting that, on average, realized rates were in line with our projections for the quarter. Our outperformance
compared to our prior expectations was primarily driven by slightly lower-than-expected deposit betas.
On a quarterly average basis, deposit balances decreased by 3% sequentially. Noninterest-bearing deposits
represented 26% of total deposit balances, which continues to be above our long-term range of 20% to 25%
based on historical averages in normal interest rate environment. Average interest-earning assets decreased by
1% quarter-over-quarter. Underneath that, cash and reverse repo was flat, loan balances were down 6%, and our
investment securities portfolio was flat.
Moving on to expenses on page 6. Expenses for the quarter were $3.1 billion, up 3% year-over-year. As
mentioned earlier, this reflects investments in higher revenue-related expenses, partially offset by efficiency
savings and the impact of the sale of Alcentra. The impact of inflation and merit increases was largely offset by
the favorable impact of the stronger dollar.
Robin has been clear about our determination to bend the cost curve. We're executing with discipline and
urgency, as you can see signs of our delivery in our professional, legal and other purchase services, net
occupancy and business development lines. We feel good about our progress in the first quarter and how it
positions us for efficiency savings in the coming quarters to help us meet our goal for the year.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
Turning to our business segments, let's start with Securities Services on page 7. As I discussed the performance
of our Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services segments, I will comment on the investment services
fees for each line of business described in our earnings press release and the financial supplement.
Securities Services reported total revenue of $2.1 billion, up 19% year-over-year. Fee revenue was up 4%. Within
this, FX revenue was down 6% as the benefit of higher volatility was more than offset by a decline in emerging
market volumes, and net interest revenue was up 77%.
In Asset Servicing, investment services fees decreased by 5%. The benefit of lower money market fee waivers
and net new business was more than offset by the impact of lower market values, lower client activity and the
stronger dollar. In Issuer Services, investment services fees increased by 67%. This increase largely reflects the
absence of the notable item last year related to Russia as well as lower money market fee waivers in Corporate
Trust.
Next, Market and Wealth Services on page 8. Markets and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.5 billion,
up 22% year-over-year. Fee revenue was up 10% and net interest revenue increased by 53%. In Pershing,
investment services fees were up 15%, primarily driven by the abatement of money market fee waivers, partially
offset by lower client activity. Net new assets were a healthy $37 billion in the quarter, and average active clearing
accounts were up 6% year-on-year.
In Treasury Services, investment services fees decreased slightly by 1%, driven by higher earnings credits on
noninterest-bearing deposit balances on the back of higher interest rates, partially offset by lower money market
fee waivers and net new business. And in Clearance and Collateral Management, investment services fees were
up 7%, largely reflecting higher US government clearance volumes amid continued demand for US Treasuries.
Moving on to Investment and Wealth Management on page 9. Investment and Wealth Management reported total
revenue of $827 million, down 14% year-over-year. Fee revenue was down 15%. Investment and other revenue
was $6 million in the quarter primarily reflecting seed capital gains as opposed to losses in the first quarter of last
year. And net interest revenue was down 21% year-over-year.
Assets under management of $1.9 trillion decreased by 16% year-over-year. As I mentioned earlier, this decrease
largely reflects lower market values and the unfavorable impact of the stronger dollar, partially offset by
cumulative net inflows. In the quarter, we saw $5 billion of net inflows into long-term products. We continued to
see healthy net inflows into our LDI strategies of $10 billion, and we also saw $4 billion of net inflows into our fixed
income strategy. In cash, while we expected outflows from a small number of clients, this was offset by healthy
inflows on the back of our continued strong investment performance.
In Investment Management, revenue was down 15% year-over-year. This decrease reflects the impact of the sale
of Alcentra, the mix of cumulative net inflows, lower market values and the stronger dollar, and was partially offset
by lower money market fee waivers. In Wealth Management, revenue was down 12%, driven by lower market
values and changes in product mix. Client assets of $279 billion was down 9% year-over-year, primarily driven by
lower market values.
Page 10 shows the results of the Other segment.
I'll close with a few comments on how we're currently thinking about our financial outlook for the year which, in
short, remains basically unchanged. From our earnings call in January, you will recall that based on market-

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
implied forward interest rates at the end of last year, we projected an approximately 20% year-over-year increase
in net interest revenue for the full year 2023.
As you all know, we continue to see significant volatility in rates. Markets and market-implied forward interest
rates currently suggest some meaningful Fed easing relative to the dot plots. We have positioned ourselves for
continued interest rate volatility and retain ample flexibility and liquidity to respond to a wide range of outcomes as
the ultimate impact of continued tightening remains uncertain.
We're off to a good start in the first quarter. And based on market-implied forward interest rates at the end of
March, we still believe our outlook for 20% year-over-year growth in net interest revenue is realistic with some
skew to the upside. We also still expect expenses excluding notable items, to be up 4% year-over-year, assuming
foreign exchange rates at the end of last year, or by approximately 4.5% on a constant currency basis.
As we said on our earnings call in January, we are determined to deliver some positive operating leverage this
year. We still expect an effective tax rate in the 21% to 22% range. And finally, as we calibrate the amount and
pace of our continuing share repurchases in the weeks and months ahead, we will be mindful of the continued
uncertainty in the operating environment, especially as it relates to the uncertain path of interest rates. And so,
we're planning to maintain our current more conservative capital buffers for the time being.
So, to wrap up, we're pleased with the company's solid financial performance in the first quarter, which, amid a
challenging operating environment, once again showcase the strength and resilience of our business model. As
we look forward, we are continuing to manage our balance sheet conservatively and we are confident that we are
well positioned to help our clients navigate the elevated uncertainty in global markets.
With that, operator, can you please open the line for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with
Jefferies.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey. Thanks, guys. Welcome, Dermot. To follow up on your NII, you reiterated 20%, perhaps a little upside.
Obviously, with a good start to the year, that implies a sequential slide as the year goes through. Can you just
help us understand how that works through in terms of what you're expecting for deposit trends and liability costs
as you look through to that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dermot William McDonogh A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Okay. Good morning, Ken, and thanks for the question. Before I answer, I'd just like to acknowledge Emily, who
was the former CFO and has been a tremendous partner with the transition, and to the Finance team and Investor
Relations team who really helped me settle in well, and it's a real privilege to be here, and I look forward to
working with you all.
So, on to your specific question around the mix between NII and deposits. Look, back in January, the environment
was a little bit different to where it is today. We feel we've had a very good start to NII. We did a lot of scenario
analysis in January to come up with that number. And look, there was a big divergence between the market-
implied forward curve, which we use to budget and project where we think NII is, versus where the Fed is in the
dot plots.
If you look at it today, there's a little bit more of a coming together of that and there's more of a market color
around higher for longer. We're positioned for that. We feel good about it. And as a consequence of that, we've
locked in a good quarter and we feel good about subsequent quarters. And look, the important thing in my
remarks was skewed to the upside. The range of outcomes is probably more uncertain today than it was in
January. We have the debt ceiling to come, geopolitical uncertainty, all the factors that you would know about.
And as a consequence, I don't really want to update the guidance, but feel we're solid on 20% with that skewed to
the upside.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got it. Great. And just as a follow-up then, can you maybe just flesh out a little bit how you're thinking about how
the deposit trends go from here, both in an absolute sense? And then perhaps what that mix of DDAs to total
looks like from, I think, the 26% that you posted this quarter? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dermot William McDonogh A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. So, if you take a step back on deposits and think about coming out of the pandemic and as people started
to focus on inflation and having better yield opportunities and you look at the system in total, you see over the
course of the last 15 months across the industry deposits leaving the system. We're tracking that. And we're the
same really as everybody else. We're down 3% in terms of average deposits.

And maybe if I double-click on what happened in the quarter a little bit, up to March, we were in line with our
forecast, which gave us the 20% year-over-year growth. We had a blip to the upside for deposits in the latter part
of March as a result of a little bit of the turmoil that happened there. We saw a flight to our balance sheet. People
wanted to use our platform. And so, we saw deposits elevate. Now that's largely moderated, albeit, we're a little
bit above our forecast.
We expect that to moderate further like the rest of the industry in the coming quarters as our clients are
sophisticated and they will look for yield. But, look, I refer you to Robin's comments in his remarks where he
talked about the cash ecosystem and we touch $1.3 trillion of a cash ecosystem. We want to point them to our
products and services. So, while they may not use our deposit platform, we want them to use other products
within our ecosystem. So we feel very good about where our deposit balances are and the trajectory for the rest
of the year.

So, wanted to start off with just a question on some of the buyback commentary. We saw a strong capital return in
the quarter. You noted plans to temper the pace of buyback. Was hoping to get some more context as to what's
informing that decision.
If I think about some of the key inputs, the leverage denominator should be shrinking, albeit modestly, given some
of the deposit commentary you just cited. You sounded more sanguine on Basel IV, you're less exposed to credit
shocks. It just feels like you're better placed than most to continue a healthy pace of buyback. Just want to
understand the decision to retrench a bit in terms of the pace of deployment.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
Thanks for the question, Steven. I wouldn't use the word retrench. I would just go back to January and just
reaffirm what we said we'd do, which is return north of 100% of earnings to our shareholders this year. In Q1, it
was a total of $1.6 billion, of which $300 million was dividends, $1.3 billion in share repurchases, so a good start.
March came along and maybe some of it is me being a freshman CFO and wanting to just slow down the pace a
bit to see how the macro environment plays out. There's a lot of uncertainty out there. I would reiterate we are
going to continue to buy back, but we're just going to take it easy now and watch the situation day by day, week
by week, if the situation clarifies itself. If we get debt ceiling resolution, there are a lot of things that play into the
next couple of months, and we'll watch and see and adjust accordingly.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
So, just to understand, you're making adjustments, but are you still committed to the 100% payout or north of
100% payout at least for the time being?

Dermot William McDonogh A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
That's correct, Steven.

Okay. Great. And just for my follow-up on the topic of efficiency, really encouraging to hear that you're doubling
the efficiency savings this year. I know you had highlighted that previously. We saw some really nice progress in
improving the Securities Services operating margin. You talked about staying disciplined on managing cost there.
With the margin there above 25%, how quickly do you think you can get to that 30% margin? I wanted to
understand, what your plans are for the Investment Management segment, in particular. The pro forma the
Alcentra sale, the margin there is fairly subdued, just wanted to get some expectation around where you think that
margin could potentially traject to over time, what your plans are in terms of efficiency, if there are any for the
Investment Management segment as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dermot William McDonogh A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Okay. So there were a few questions there. So I'll try and deal with them as best I can. So, if we zoom out for a
second and look at the firm, yeah, 28% margin with a 20% ROTCE, the highest in three years, okay? So, margin
good, always want to improve.
And then you double-click into that and you go Securities Services 26% going to 30%. The positive in there is,
Emily was the CFO for a number of years, and now I get to partner with her figuring out how to drive that margin
higher. And so, we have a plan. You will have noted that we committed to halve the expense growth year-over-
year. We're off to a good start and that will have – that segment will be a beneficiary of that.
Then you double-click into the next segment which is Market and Wealth Services, which is a 48% margin, which
I have no problems as CFO with that, long may it continue. And then we go into Investment and Wealth
Management, which 11% margin is a bit – to be honest, it's probably a bit disappointing. But, 18 months ago, that
was a 30% margin business, and we don't see any reason why we can't get back there with a lot of hard work.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
There were quite a number of headwinds going into that last year, lower market values, a significant
strengthening of the dollar. And so,me of our clients wanted to do a bit of a mix shift from equities to fixed income,
and that was going from higher fee to lower fee. But the important point that I would draw to you there is the
clients stayed in our ecosystem and that's the key message. Clients are in our ecosystem and just mix shifting,
and we're working with our clients to deliver good outcomes for them.

Operator: And our next question will come from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for the question. I was hoping we can zone in on fees in Investment
Services, particularly within Asset Servicing and Pershing. At a macro level, it feels like a lot of things have gone
your way, markets were up. Activity rates were very strong, particularly in Treasuries, money market funds, retail,
et cetera. So all sort of things in your wheelhouse, yet the revenues in both businesses were down sequentially.
So can you just unpack a little bit what were some of the offsets that drove to disappointment on fees? And as
you look out, I guess, for the rest of the year, I think on the Q4 call, you guys made comments around just the
overall firm-wide fee growth for 2023, just wondering to get your latest thoughts on that. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dermot William McDonogh A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Hi, Alex. Hope you're well. As a former colleague, I think you were supposed to ask me an easy question not a
hard question. So, look, Asset Servicing, the way I think about Asset Servicing is – and look, the headline number
is 2% down, yeah? That equates to a little over $50 million, yeah? In the context of our quarter, that's a small
number.
So the way I think big picture, again, I've said this in the answer to other questions. Did we attract clients to our
ecosystem? Yes. And then within that it's like how do we derive fee revenue from those clients. Some of it has to
do with market levels, some of it has to do with volume, and so,me of it is other stuff like account opening.
So, within that context, we did see a risk-off sentiment from our clients wanting to pause, push stuff out to
subsequent quarters. So the client volumes were down and so, that really drove the Asset Servicing side of it.
And if you look at Issuer Services, it's a smaller number for us, but that's a seasonal business, and Depository
Receipts is within that. And Q1 is typically a quiet quarter there, and we'll expect that to pick up in Q2 for dividend
season. And on the plus side for Asset Servicing, we had higher market levels, and we got some fees from that.
So, overall, I feel good about Asset Servicing. We have to work hard on the fee outlook, but it's not – I would say,
it's not as negative as some commentators would portray the fee outlook to be as I see the situation today.

As it goes to Pershing, look, we're very excited about the Pershing business. You'll see from our commentary in
our prepared remarks that we had $37 billion onto our system. Robin talked about it in his prepared remarks.
We're very excited about Pershing X, the partnership with Snowflake. We're going to do a lot of great stuff in that
area. And we will tell you about it as the quarters unfold, but Pershing and Pershing X is very, very exciting for us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got you. Thanks. Maybe as a former colleague, an easier question on the follow-up. I guess, as you sort of think
about the dynamics in the banking space over the last month, month and a half and so,rt of the disruption that
that's created and so,me of the opportunities that you guys might see on the back of that, whether it's retaining
some of the deposits that came over or some new areas within the fee side of the equation. Where do you think
you could lean into most to gain extra share?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Vince A
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Look, Alex, I'll start there. Look, I think the events of March have really shown the importance of asset liability
management as a key discipline. And so,, whether you start on the asset side and think about tailoring your
liabilities accordingly or you start on the liability side and make sure that you've got the right duration of assets
and the right composition of assets. That to me is lesson number one. I'm sure we'll see a bunch of outcomes
from that from policymakers over time as that all gets digested.
We're in the preparedness business, not the predicting business, and that goes to everything across the
franchise. And we positioned ourselves well for this, and we positioned ourselves so that we would be able to deal
with lots of different eventualities and, critically, to your question, that we could help clients through those various
different eventualities.
And so, we're proud of the fact that we served as a little bit of a port in the storm for some of our clients. We've
had a lot of net new accounts opened in various angles on the business. And I think it's reaffirmed for us, and we
said this before, that resiliency is a commercial attribute. We spend a lot of money on resiliency. We spend money
in terms of making sure that our technology systems are state-of-the-art, all of the investment that we've made
over the course of the past few years, our investment in cyber. But it's also investment in the resiliency of our
balance sheet, and the combination of that allows us to then be able to use times like this to be able to attract
clients to the platform.
Dermot talked a bit more about that ecosystem, which is another example, which is we built the businesses over
time, and we've went into investments in those businesses that allow clients to be able to get what they need
within our ecosystem, even when they may be a little risk on, they may be a little risk off, they may favor deposits,
they may favor a money market fund, they may favor equities, they may favor fixed income, but we have all of
those cylinders, if you will, to the engine to be able to help our clients.
And we think that breadth and that diversification of the business, which is built up over a period of time and which
we have been leaning into is very, very important. I know we get described as a trust bank. And by the way, we're
proud of the trust that that moniker implies, but remember that our most profitable, highest growth, highest margin
segment of Market and Wealth Services contains a set of businesses which you would not find in a trust bank.

Operator: And our next question will come from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Dermot, welcome to the role. Looking forward to working with you.
A question on the NII reiteration, Dermot. So, previously, there was an expectation that noninterest-bearing
deposits would get back to the historic 20% to 25% range. Is that still the case?
And can you maybe add a little color on why you think the noninterest-bearing deposits have stayed above that
range that we've seen in prior history? Is there a business mix shift change that has happened or any other
structural reason which could cause it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dermot William McDonogh A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Thanks for the question, Brennan. So, like the way I think about it again is like I know I've said it a couple of times,
it really is NIBs and BNY Mellon, it really is an ecosystem point that I will start with. Clients leave – and we don't
lead with the deposit product. Clients come to our ecosystem for a range of products, and they leave their cash
with us to prosecute that business.
So I'll pick out three examples like Corporate Trust, NIBs stay with us because they have to make coupon
payments. Treasury Services clients leave balances with us to offset fees. Asset Servicing balances stay with us
because of underlying client activity. And then our Clearance and Collateral Management business, to mention
another one, we have decent NIBs there. So our businesses are bigger than a few years ago. Balances are
bigger and clients are doing more with us. So NIBs are just attracted to the ecosystem.
So then you take a look at history and you do the bottoms-up analysis. And through the last cycle, NIBs did
bottom out at the 20% range. Currently, we're at – we're still at around the 26% range. It stayed sticky. And I think
our reason that you could ascribe to that is clients left cash with us in March because they just wanted to leave
and use the safety and resilience of our balance sheet, and just it stayed there.
And so, in our forward outlook in terms of why we reiterate the 20% guidance with the skew to the upside is we
expect that to moderate, not meaningfully, but in line with our projection and the work that we did at the beginning
of the year. So we feel good about where it is at the moment. We feel good about the forecast. And it's been
stickier in the past than we projected it to be is how I would answer it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Vince A
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
But we're not relying on that stickiness. And I think that is an important point that Dermot mentioned. And so,, to
the extent that we are – we will harvest the benefits as we have them, but we definitely recognize that they could
go down to the prior cycle lows in percentage composition terms, and we're managing ourselves accordingly.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah. That's very, very clear. Thanks for all that color. Robin, you spoke to – you actually said it very eloquently,
resiliency is a commercial attribute. In the past, you've spoken to the embedded position that BK – Bank of New
York has as a counterparty. How are you thinking about utilizing that position and that commercial attribute of
resiliency in order to drive revenue? Do you have any additional color or commentary that you can provide on how
you've been thinking about that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Vince A
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. So, look, we've been quite careful over the course of the events of March to help our clients and to welcome
clients into the ecosystem, but we have not wanted to profit from the fact that there's been stress in the system.
And so, that's obviously an important line. And we participated, as you know, we're one of the 11 banks that
participated in helping another key participant in the financial system with a large deposit.
And so, we are very cognizant of our role in the system and the responsibility that we have to the system given
the role that we play. But, at the same time, over time, we do view this resiliency to be a strong commercial asset.
So, if you step back from the whole of BNY Mellon, I think of ourselves as sort of offering a couple of things that
are really differentiating.
One is this 239-year history where we touch 20% of the world's investable assets. We are the world's largest
custodian. We are the world's largest collateral manager. We have that $1.3 trillion worth of cash in the
ecosystem. We have another $5.5 trillion worth of tri-party. That's $7 trillion in total in that space. Largest
Depositary Receipts firm, number one in the broker-dealer, Pershing, wealth management infrastructure space, et
cetera.
We have these terrific individual components. And for us, bringing them together and actually being able to
demonstrate to our clients the breadth of the platform with the resiliency that we offer, we think that's a winning
combination and one that, over time, as I've talked about before, we don't think we've taken full advantage of.
So, it is telling this story of who we are, our place in the world, the roles that we play and helping our clients to
realize just the breadth of activity that they can actually do with us and the fact that they can trust and rely on us.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey. Well, as you said to me at the annual meeting, it's a new country, new firm, and new job. And so, just pulling
the lens out a little bit, now that I can ask you a question specifically, how do you approach the CFO job? What
skill set do you bring to the position? I know Emily's still there, bigger and better, but how might you look at things
a little bit differently? What kind of lens do you use? And what are your objectives, say, over the next several
years?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dermot William McDonogh A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Okay. So it's interesting, you asked the question, Mike. When Robin and I talked about the opportunity and when I
decided to join, I listened to the first earnings call after I'd made the decision to join. And Robin, in his first as
CEO-apparent, he talked about connecting the dots across the enterprise, and he's just answered – in the
question that he just answered there, he talked about that too.
And so,, in my prior life, connecting the dots across the enterprise was a thing that I majored on. I also grew up in
the financial world, and I intend, hope and plan to bring financial discipline across the firm. We have a great
Finance team here at BNY Mellon. I couldn't be prouder of what they do.
And so, I think about the role in three ways. One is working with all of you, clients, regulators, external
stakeholders, really delivering the message of what we're about at BNY Mellon over the next several years. So I
view that as very important. And then, internally, working with the Executive Committee and the rest of the
leadership of the firm and the Finance team to develop really good financial analysis in which we can make good
strategic decisions about the way we want to take the firm. And that's a lot of work. But the team has already done
a good job. And look, you're beginning to see the fruits of this come out in the expense area and other parts.
In terms of my top three priorities for this year, it really is about slowing the expense growth of the firm. We've
made a commitment. One quarter in, we're delivering on it. And this is not about – I don't think about it, in some
ways, as expense cutting, it's like – it's attacking structural expense bases in the firm where we can think we
really fundamentally believe we can do the same thing in just a better way and more efficiently. And we want to
invest and grow the firm.
So it's – I think about my expense priority as like how do I think about run the bank and how do I think about grow
the bank, because we really want to take those dollars that we get from efficiency and invest in things like
Pershing X and other really key growth initiatives. So it's all about financial discipline and giving the team the
financial resources they need to grow the firm.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dermot William McDonogh A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
And just managing the balance sheet, which is a thing that we've had to do in the last couple of months quite
aggressively.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Just one follow-up. Connecting the dots, it makes sense. You and Robin both came from Goldman Sachs where
there's the culture of connecting the dots. It's just the incentives to get people to connect the dots, right? Breaking

down the barriers, breaking down the silos, and don't people just ultimately do what they get paid for? And isn't
that like a big, tough task to change the incentive scheme to get people to connect the dots with each other?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Vince A
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So, if your question is, does it take a lot of work and is it a big task to run a company differently than it's been run
before? The answer is absolutely yes. And we have got a leadership team who are very focused on approaching
the next decade differently than the last decade. And this point of connecting the dots is a very important one.
Let me give you one example. So, Dermot was talking about in our Investment Management business and he
also mentioned Pershing. And so,, Mike, when you look at those two businesses, just interestingly, they couldn't
have been run more separately within the ecosystem of BNY Mellon.
Investment Management was run as essentially almost a separate company off to the side. Pershing was run
essentially as a different separate company off to a different side. And we never really explored the opportunities
to be able to think about the manufacturing of Investment Management with the fact that we have across Pershing
and Wealth Management a $2.5 trillion distribution base. Now, we're an open architecture firm. And so,, we aren't
distributing all of our manufactured product into our distribution arms, but we have opportunity to explore that,
which frankly hasn't been fully explored up until now.
Take the adjacency between margin where we've seen a significant growth for our Collateral Management
business associated with new margin rules of uncleared margin. Exchanges need more efficient margin delivery.
Those products are very adjacent to the rest of our Collateral Management business in tri-party. They're also quite
adjacent to our foreign exchange business. They're quite adjacent to our cash management ecosystem. So we
have both diversification in the firm, but we also have a lot of natural adjacencies that people haven't explored
before. So that's the way I think strategically about it.
And then your question is one of the several pillars of execution, which is what are the things that we have to do
to actually get after that; some of those things are structural, some of them are incentive-based, some of them are
people-based, some of them are organizational-based. And so,, we're going to approach all of those different
pillars so that we ultimately attack that strategy effectively, and we're very committed to doing it.

Good morning.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Can you share with us, Robin, around the debt ceiling that's coming up for this country, what type of risks there
are for your business if a debt ceiling isn't negotiated effectively by Congress and the President. Can you – what
risk do you see in just that situation developing as we go forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Vince A
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So, first of all, we obviously do play an important and so,mewhat special role as a market infrastructure provider in
the space and we have a good vantage point on the operating of the Treasury market. We don't have a crystal
ball though, obviously, in terms of how debt ceiling is going to get resolved. And we do think of the Fed and the
Treasury as clients of ours as well, and we want a seamless experience as much as possible for them and also,
of course, for our broader client franchise. And so, we're really doing a couple of things.
Number one, we think it's our responsibility to the system to lean in to the dialogue that's going on in DC in a way
that can be helpful. And so,, doing our bit for raising awareness, sort of educating on various things. Debt ceiling
breach is not the same thing as a government shutdown and making sure that that folks really understand what
would happen and so,me of those consequences. And so, we're spending time there. We obviously spend time
with the Fed and the Treasury on the topic, as you would imagine.
And then, internally, really for the benefit of our clients, we're using all of the lessons learned from the past to
update our playbooks. We're putting in automation on various different things, and we are organized around being
very ready to be able to execute come what may. Now, of course, we're going to take a lot of guidance from the
Fed and the Treasury on that as well as we go through it. So there are a whole bunch of different things that we
are doing.
I will also note that in the background, our own iFlow data, which, as you know, we have quite good insights into
market liquidity. It shows that, once again, Treasury market liquidity isn't great. The market is a little bit less
supported from foreign buyers. We can see that from our iFlow data and we all have access to the information on
sort of off-the-run versus on-the-run bid offers, etcetera. And so, it's not great from a starting point, which I think is
a cautionary tale to the official sector that we really do want to try to get a good outcome on this thing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good, Robin. Thank you. And then, Dermot, more of a technical question. In your average balance sheet, I
think in the supplement, it's page 7. Can you share with us, why is the Fed funds sold yield so high? And the
same thing with the Fed funds purchase. The yield's – one 16.3% in the first quarter and then the Fed funds sold
looks like it's 19.75%. Any particular reason why these seem to be out of line with the rest of the yields in the
balance sheet?

Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Come back. Yeah. I'm on my handset. It's much better than my headset. Okay. Just wanted to come back to the
growth in Pershing and Asset Servicing, the revenue growth. I heard you loud and clear on the drivers for 1Q. As
we think about the trajectory over the course of this year, I guess two questions on this.
First of all, did you benefit, do you think, from a revenue perspective in those areas on the fee side in March
versus January, February? So, just to get a sense of how volatility can help the revenue picture. And then,
secondarily, if you can talk about what you mentioned before in terms of connecting the dots, if you will, and how
sort of quickly that can work its way into the revenue picture? Or is that much more of a longer-term goal? And
then I'll do a follow-up question separately.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dermot William McDonogh A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Okay. So, Brian, let me start with Pershing. So, I would say in both businesses that you asked a question on, Q1
was – it was predominantly a risk-off environment, but notwithstanding the risk-off environment for Pershing, we
attracted $37 billion of new assets onto our system. And so, we're growing organically at a nice clip, which we're
very pleased about.
So, I would say, Pershing feels good, the outlook feels good and we're going to do the launch – official launch of
Pershing X in June. And so, the clients that are beta-testing that feel good about what they're seeing. We've got
the partnership with Snowflake. So, I would say the outlook for that business overall in terms of our continued
growth in assets – and as a consequence of that, notwithstanding the risk-off sentiment in Q1, we believe being
the number one in the market with broker-dealers and the several million active clearing accounts that we have on
the system, we feel pretty good about the future for that one.
Asset Servicing, I think the way I would think about Asset Servicing is more steady as she goes, yeah? It's a big

would characterize it, we're both a fixed income house and an equity house. And so, two-thirds of what comes in
is largely fixed income related, one-third equities.
And we continue to grow our AUC and our AUM. And so,, over time, that mix shift between fixed income and
equities where they either play to our strengths or it will slow us down a bit. So, overall, we feel like it's a steady
as she goes environment for Asset Servicing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's great color. And then if I could just follow-up with the comments you made on the global multi-asset
trading capabilities, similar question there. Is that something more near-term or a little bit of a longer-term build
out? And is that coming in Asset Servicing or the FX and other trading line?
And then if I can sneak in on Pershing X, if you're rolling that out in June, should we expect a revenue ramp
contribution in the second half to that? Or again, is that more of a longer-term build?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Vince A
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So, I'll start with Pershing X. That is a longer-term build. We've talked about the fact that it wasn't going to
meaningfully contribute over the course of the first couple of years since we first talked about that. And so, that's
really a 2022, 2023 thing. You should expect essentially nothing from it in that period of time. But we'll update as
we go past launch. We'll give you some updated view on that. But I view that as being a 2024, 2025, 2026 story
overall in terms of its ramp. And again, we're still in beta testing. We feel quite enthusiastic about the client
response to the product, but I'm going to reserve judgment until we start signing contracts and were launched live
in the market on that.
In terms of Outsourced Trading, so this is something that we've launched and we made the public launch during
the quarter. Hence, we've made the comment, but this is a very medium, long-term opportunity. We talked before
about the fact that, as a firm, we are very interested in crawling up the value chain of the various different
businesses that we do in Asset Servicing.
Once upon a time it was custody and then middle office got added and now data solutions get added, and
integration, and these various different components that create a broader solution set for investment management
and asset owner clients. And now we're adding to that and saying, hey, there's not actually a ton of alpha for an
asset owner or investment manager, particularly one that is managing in the tens or hundreds of billions of dollars
of AUM. There's not a lot of alpha associated with execution.
The alpha is in portfolio construction, asset selection, but the actual buy-sell action isn't. And in fact, it's not great
scale, because clients often need desks in multiple locations. If they're a multi-asset asset manager, they need
lots of different specializations when it comes to the execution. So we have all of that.
We've executed $1 trillion or so a year of exactly that type of broad-based asset management execution for our
own investment management firm. And so, now we've turned that into a platform that can operate not only for
ourselves, but also operate for clients. We're externalizing an existing at-scale platform which is fully capable
across products and we're externalizing that now for clients and saying, hey, there's no real alpha for you
associated with your own trade execution. Let us take it off your hands.

And I view this also in a way as an extension of what we already do in foreign exchange where we do exactly that
on a range of different execution basis for our clients in foreign exchange. And so, this is something that we know
how to do and so,mething that we already do. Now we're externalizing it, and I view it as quite an exciting
evolution, but it's a very medium, long-term thing as part of our overall journey on fee growth over time.

Operator: And our next question will come from Robert Wildhack with Autonomous Research.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Wildhack Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Good morning, guys. You called out the strong pipeline in Asset Servicing while holding the line on price, and I
wanted to unpack that a little more. First, how does the current backlog and velocity of new business compare to
past periods? And then second, given that you're being disciplined on price, what are the common elements that
you think are driving your success here? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Vince A
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So this is part of our overall march to 30% margin in the Securities Services business, Rob. And so, when we look
at that, Dermot's talked a little bit about the focus on the expense line. That's important. And it goes a little bit
hand-in-hand here. If you look at our margin last year of 20%, now 26%, depending on last year or this year's stat,
but if you just take this year stat, we should be putting four times as much energy into the expense line as the
revenue line in order to be able to get the same net effect at the bottom line. And so, we're doing that.
But, on the revenue line as well as driving new activities, this discipline point. Pricing pressure is a normal part of
this business, but as we look back and we review certain deals that have been struck over the course of the past
few years, going back – in some cases, going back several years, I think we did win in some cases on price. And
we look at and we now have new capabilities about reviewing the margin on a deal-by-deal level. And when we
look at some of those deals, we're pretty disappointed. So that's causing us to engage with those clients and talk
to them about the other things that we would like to do for them that help us to be able to broadly improve the
margin at a client level.
And then, in some cases, there have been deals and I'm thinking of one example in my mind of a client who came
and they had a real expectation about pricing at a certain level. And we were like, we're just not going to do the
business at that level and we negotiated, and we substantially increased the price to a level which we thought
was appropriate for the actual business involved. And look, I don't know about the past, how that would have
happened. But if I look at the history of deals that we've actually got on the platform, my guess is that, that
behavior is not something that would have occurred before, and therefore, it's yielded a different outcome.
So there's focus on the true cost to serve and then the standardization that needs to be done across the platforms
that will improve and, in fact, reduce over time the cost to serve. So even the same piece of business can be
more profitable, not only because we're pressuring on price, but also because we're making it cheaper to actually
execute that business. And the trick will be doing both.

Dermot William McDonogh A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. Look, the point I would add in there halving the growth rates and becoming more efficient as a company.
So all the work that we do on expenses and efficiency management feed into that discussion as well. So you have
to join the expense narrative, again, with the pricing good business narrative to get the complete picture.

Operator: And we'll take a question from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Couple of clarifications
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Vince A
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Hey, Vivek.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Couple of clarifications. The deposit inflows in March that you were talking about, which businesses did you
see that in?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dermot William McDonogh A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So I would say, broadly speaking, we saw it across the ecosystem. The point-to-point was up 1%. We finished the
quarter on a period-end basis at $281 billion. Our average for the quarter was, I think, roughly $277 billion (sic)
[$274 billion]. But there was no one business; it really was broadly spread. And I guess the important point that I
would call out here is, we made a strategic decision about 15 months ago to centralize how we think about
deposits into one platform.
So we think of deposits as a platform as well as a product. And we have very, very good client connectivity and
engagement. So, when we talk about deposits, we talk about it across the system, and that will echo Robin's point
about connecting the firm, de-siloing different businesses, so we think of deposits as an enterprise effort. And
that's how it came together for us in the quarter.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
Thanks. And the flip side, during this turmoil in March, there was a lot of inflows into money market funds. But
when I look at your cash AUM, you had no – for the quarter, it shows no inflows. Any color on why you didn't
benefit in that business also because you've historically been a big player in there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dermot William McDonogh A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So, yeah, like I think – and historically, I would say – and continue to be a very big player in that. Our performance
in our Dreyfus cash business has been excellent and continues to be excellent this year. The simple answer to
that question is, we had some – we knew in January, we were going to have some known outflows. So we were
projecting to be slightly down in Q1.
And with the inflows as a result of what happened in March, that got us back to flat. So, overall, I think the
average balances were higher, but on a period-to-period basis, were flat. But we continue to feel very good about
the business. And more importantly, performance. And in this business performance matters, so we expect that
will – you'll see better balances going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
And the outflows that you're talking about in January, what was driving that? Is that pricing? Is that something
else? What drives that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dermot William McDonogh A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
It was clients wanting to do something else with their cash. They told us that they were doing it. It was in our
forecast at the time. We knew it was going to happen. There was no specific reason.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Vince A
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
And I'll just add on to that. I think this quarter was a little idiosyncratic in a couple of different ways. And last year,
we outgrew the market in the Dreyfus money market platform. And so,rt of two other observations. There's a little
bit of composition that you have to look at under the hood on these institutional money market funds in terms of
where the money is coming from. Was it really coming from sort of mega individual ultra-high net worth or was it
coming from actual institutional flows. And so, I think you have to look a little bit at that on a money market fund
by money market fund basis as well.
And then, as Dermot pointed out, the broader – our broader connectivity to money market funds goes beyond our
own money market funds. And so, we have this market-leading LiquidityDirect product. And so,, even when
money goes to other money market funds, we are benefiting from that because we have this connectivity. And so,
we are a very large source of inflows to some of those other money market funds that you've seen growing.
And again, this is the benefit of the ecosystem. It might be on our balance sheet, it might be on our money market
fund, it might be in someone else's money market fund. It might be that we're selling Treasury Bills to clients, but
all of those things are in the mix as is the repo and Fed's reverse repo facility.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
Operator: And we'll take a question from Rajiv Bhatia with Morningstar.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Rajiv Bhatia Q
Analyst, Morningstar, Inc. (Research)
Good morning. Thinking about operational interest-bearing deposit versus nonoperational interest-bearing
deposits, how much does the rate you pay differ between those two buckets?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Vince A
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So we don't disclose the exact rates on the different components, but let me just sort of broadly talk to you about
the deposits, Rajiv, because I think this is quite important. So first of all, to me, the decision tree is not insured
versus uninsured. That's a convenience. It's sort of a retail expression. It's a shorthand that gets used in the
market. The ultimate decision tree is whether deposits are stable and sticky or whether they're not.
And insured is just one lens of that, and that lens is a bit more relevant to retail than institutional. And by the way,
even within insured, not all deposits are equally sticky, right? Because you've got checking, you've got high-yield
savings, you're going to have different outcomes for these, whether they're true operational accounts, even on the
retail side.
But there are other types of sticky and stable. And so,, for us, two-thirds of our deposits in the first quarter are
operational across our portfolio of businesses. And those are, as Dermot said earlier on, those are required in
order to be able to provide clients with those operational services. And it's diversified across our portfolio, and you
know custody, cash management, clearing, corporate trust, there are a bunch of different sort of business
cylinders that give rise in that operational cash engine. And we obviously spend a lot of time and effort modeling
all of these types of things and so,rt of – and we've seen that that is really proven to be stable over multiple
cycles. And so, that's sort of why we focus so much on operational.
And then, for nonoperational deposits, look, there's a little bit there associated with we don't expect them to leave,
but we plan for them to be able to leave at obviously at a much, much higher rate than we would think about that
on the operational side, because we just think that's good asset liability management.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Rajiv Bhatia Q
Analyst, Morningstar, Inc. (Research)
Okay. And then just one follow-up. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned that Wealth Management revenues
were down in part due to changes in product mix. Can you expand on what that is and whether you expect that to
continue?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dermot William McDonogh A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So I think that just goes back to the point of the risk-off sentiment that we saw in Q1 and people just wanting to, A,
not do activity and move from fixed income products to equity products (sic) [equity to fixed income products].
Normal behavior. Nothing out of the ordinary that I would call out; totally expected, just us working with the clients
to deliver the risk appetite that they wanted to have for that quarter.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
The turmoil of March is , you would say, for now, may have a basis and we may see a change in client behavior.
But back when they took these actions in March, we didn't know how long we were going to be in this situation for.
So it's behavior that we expected to see and is I would view it as normal BAU.

ahead.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Oh. Hi. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Vince A
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Hey, Betsy. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. Okay. Just a couple of things. One, on the MMF discussion that you just had with Vivek, you also benefited
from MMF through your custody platform as well, right, because you custody a lot of MMF, is that fair?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Vince A
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah, that's right. We touch – it's another touch point with money market funds on the Asset Servicing side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Right. Okay. And that helped the deposits, I'm guessing. So my question really has to do with your role as a
global payment provider, one of the top, obviously. And I think you're involved in the FedNow pilot. I just wanted to
get a sense as to how you're thinking about how FedNow is integrated within your global payments platform, get
an update on the BNY Mellon digital asset platform. And is there anything that's going on within crypto that would
have you lean in or out? So three legs of that question. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Vince A
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Okay. So let me start with real-time. We are part of the FedNow test, I think, actually, might have been the first
bank to start testing on it. We were the first bank to do a test on The Clearing House Real-Time Payment rails.
And look, overall, when I step back from Real-Time Payments, if I use that as the generic term that would cover

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2023
both FedNow and The Clearing House, it is a couple of things. It is a new payment rail. And I think that represents
an interesting disruption, and we would like to participate in that disruption, which is one of the reasons why we've
been leaning in. I think there's a bunch of opportunities for clients there, quicker, cheaper, more control over the
payments. And so, that's a good thing. Saves them dollars. And ultimately, it's quite helpful for the industry's
carbon footprint as well, because it's really a check – should be, over time, a check eradicator and there's a lot of
sort of carbon footprint and ESG, more broadly, in the handling of checks. So that would be a good thing.
We've got the opportunity to be part of that disruption because of our existing Treasury Services business. And
we see that also as part of a broader solution set because wrapped up in Real-Time Payments, there's payment
validation, there's fraud protection and there are other data services, and we find ourselves selling that bundle
more often than not when we sell RTP. And I think we have a position – you sort of framed it in terms of FedNow,
but we have a position in terms of Real-Time Payments and payments more broadly, as a pretty unconflicted
provider.
As you said, we're a very large provider. But that unconflicted nature means that whether you're a fintech,
whether you're a small or medium-size regional bank, whether you're a [ph] foreign (01:20:34) bank, we're not
threatening as a set of rails to plug into, and that makes us pretty appealing as a partner. But, look, this is a
multiyear endeavor. We're pleased with the traction. We've done a bunch of stuff, and we're playing it forward.
But, obviously, the story is going to be inextricably linked to seeing all of this take hold in the US.
The other key question that you asked, Betsy, was on digital assets. And look, I haven't changed my point of view
here at all. I view it as a completely different thing than Real-Time Payments. And in fact, in digital assets, some
people do conflate the two and view things like coins and central bank digital currencies as solutions to problems,
which I would actually argue that Real-Time Payments might be a better solution for. So, there is a little bit of
overlap, but I do favor Real-Time Payments more broadly on the question of how to speed up payment rails and
payment processes in the United States to make them more efficient.
But then, on digital assets, we think this is about the tech. We've believed in the fact that distributed ledger
technology, smart contracts that you can build on top of it have good opportunity over time. That's many years,
maybe several decades' evolution. It's still early. Hasn't really been proven. I think we'll see opportunities to have
more efficiency, easier handling of certain asset types. Think about things that aren't as standardized today, so
they're messy in the financial services system like real estate and loans, probably speed up settlement there on
tokenization as a sort of – as a new form of handling assets. So we like all of those concepts. But in terms of the
actual cryptos, we've said all along, we're going to be incredibly slow. We'll crawl before we run on digital assets
broadly and cryptos are – it's something that we've gone exceptionally slowly on.

Yeah. And just because of all of the opportunity – of all the infrastructure that you have, I would think you would
be an attractive place for crypto deposits. I'm wondering if that's something that you would agree with or not?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Vince A
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
I don't particularly agree with that. No. I understand that there are other firms who have, over time, made it part of
their business model to really attract a ton of cash in that space. We do not view ourselves as a crypto bank. We
have a variety of clients. We have some clients who touch the digital assets ecosystem, but that's not been a
business strategy of ours to grow that aggressively.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then just lastly, on FedNow, it launches in the next quarter or so, is that accurate? And is there a
meaningful impact? Or is this, as you mentioned, a really long runway to have an impact on your revenues?
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robin Vince A
Chief Executive Officer, President & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
It's a longer runway. You have to get confirmation from the Fed about their exact launch plans because it has
evolved a little bit. But it's a longer runway. And it isn't so much FedNow as Real-Time Payments of which
FedNow is one provider.
