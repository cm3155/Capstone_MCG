Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll make some brief comments about our third quarter results, the
operating environment, and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review third quarter
results in more detail before we take your questions.
Let me start with some third quarter highlights. We earned $5.1 billion, or $1.17 per common share, in the third
quarter. These results included a $1.7 billion decrease in the allowance for credit losses as credit quality
continued to improve. Revenue declined on lower gains from equity securities which were elevated in the second
quarter, though still strong. Expenses continued to decline, reflecting progress on our efficiency initiatives, and
included $250 million associated with the September OCC enforcement action. And for the first time since first
quarter 2020, we grew both period-end loans and deposits in the third quarter.
We continue to see that our customers have significant liquidity, and consumers are continuing to spend. While
lower than the peak in March, our consumer customers' median deposit balances continue to remain above pre-
pandemic levels, up 48% for customers who received federal stimulus, and 40% higher for those who did not
receive federal aid.
Weekly debit card spend during the third quarter was up every week compared to 2019, and in the week ending
October 1st was up 14% compared to 2020 and 26% compared to 2019. Areas hardest hit by the pandemic have
recovered, including travel, up 2%; entertainment, up 39%; and restaurant spending, up 20% during the week
ending October 1st compared with 2019.
Consumer credit card spending activity continued to increase, up 18% in the third quarter compared to 2019, and
24% compared to 2020. During the week ended October 1st, travel-related spending, which was hardest-hit
during the pandemic, was up significantly from 2020 but remains the only category that has not yet fully
rebounded to 2019 levels, still down 8% compared to 2019.
Commercial Banking loans were up slightly at the end of the third quarter, while line utilization was stable at
historic lows. Supply chain difficulties and labor shortages continue to represent significant challenges for our
client base. And as I said earlier, overall credit performance continued to be strong.
Now, let me update you on the progress we've made on our strategic priorities. First, building an appropriate risk
and control infrastructure has been and remains Wells Fargo's top priority. We reached a significant milestone
with the termination of the CFPB consent order issued in September 2016 regarding improper retail sales
practices. Its expiration reflects years of hard work by employees across Wells Fargo intended to ensure that the
conduct at the core of the CFPB order will not recur.
As a reminder, this is the second important regulatory milestone we achieved this year, with the OCC terminating
a consent order related to our BSA/AML compliance program in January. But the recent OCC actions are a
reminder that the significant deficiencies that existed when I arrived must remain our top priority. I believe we're
making meaningful progress, and I remain confident in our ability to close the remaining gaps over the next
several years.

Having said that, it continues to be the case that we are likely to have setbacks along the way. We are a different
bank today than we were several years ago. We run the company with greater oversight, transparency, and
operational disciplines. We have a new leadership team. 15 of 18 operating committee members are now new to
their roles.
I have spoken of our new leaders in many of our control functions, but we also have many new business leaders.
This includes new leaders in Consumer Banking, Small Business Banking, Auto Lending, Home Lending, Credit
Card, Merchant Services, Retail Services and Personal Lending, Digital, Strategy, Wealth and Investment
Management, and Commercial Banking.
Our control infrastructure is different, and we continue to invest in it. We take a different approach to the
consumer today. We created a Sales Practice Oversight and Management function and an Office of Consumer
Practices. Our approach to consumer remediation is dramatically different as we have meaningfully increased the
amount paid to consumers and have accelerated payment to customers.
While we are committed to devoting the resources necessary to our risk and regulatory work, we are also focused
on improving the products and services we offer. We're making investments in digital capabilities and making it
easier for customers to do business with us. In the third quarter, we announced our new long-term digital
infrastructure strategy that will move us to a multi-cloud environment. This is a critical step in our multi-year
journey to be digital-first and offer easier to use products and services.
We also joined AutoFi's North American network to provide car buyers and dealers with fast and easy online sales
and financing. And as I've spoken about previously, we're on track to roll out a new consumer mobile app at the
beginning of next year. We've also been making significant enhancements to our payments capabilities and are
seeing that momentum pull-through in our customers' Zelle usage, with Zelle users increasing 24%; transactions,
up 50%; and volumes are up 56% from a year ago.
We're executing on our work to simplify our products and build compelling offerings tailored to different customer
segments. Clear Access, our no fee overdraft checking product, now has over 1 million outstanding customer
accounts. As a reminder, this launched in September 2020. And all of our retail accounts which receive ACH
direct deposit have our Overdraft Rewind feature, which automatically reevaluates transactions from the prior
business day that have incurred an overdraft. This feature has helped over 1.3 million customers avoid overdraft-
related fees on 2.5 million transactions in the third quarter.
For the emerging affluent and affluent segments, we're making substantial changes to more consistently and
intentionally serve these customers, including products, service, marketing, and management routines. You'll hear
us talk more about how we're executing on this in the coming quarters. After successfully launching Active Cash,
our new cashback credit card in July, earlier this month we launched the Reflect card that rewards customers for
making on-time payments.
Our new Head of Small Business, Derek Ellington, will start in just a couple of days, and we believe this is another
attractive growth segment for us. Next month, Paul Camp will be joining Wells Fargo as the Head of our Global
Treasury Management businesses. This new role brings together our Treasury Management and Global Payment
Solutions teams into one organization, which will enable us to be more efficient and leverage our capabilities
more effectively to help clients manage their funds and process payments worldwide.

While we've been focused on improving the products and services we offer to our customers, we continued to
support our communities. We voluntarily committed to donate all gross processing fees from PPP loans funded in
2020 and created the Open for Business Fund to support small businesses impacted by the pandemic. We've
now donated $305 million in support of small business recovery, including 215 CDFIs, which in turn is expected to
help nearly 150,000 small business owners maintain more than 250,000 jobs.
Additionally, in the third quarter, we launched Connect to More, a resource hub for women-owned businesses and
a mentoring program partnering with Nasdaq Entrepreneurial Center to empower 500 women-owned businesses.
We committed to invest $5 million through the NeighborhoodLIFT program to help more than 300 low- and
moderate-income residents in Philadelphia with home down payment assistance. And we published our updated
ESG report and goals and performance data, which includes new disclosures on our workforce by race, gender,
and job category.
As we look forward, while there certainly risks that remain, including the latest wave of COVID infections, the
recent US fiscal policy stalemate, and inflation concerns, the outlook for the economy is promising. Consumers'
financial condition remains strong with leverage at its lowest level in 45 years and the debt burden below its long-
term average. Companies are also strong as well.
We remain on target to achieve a sustainable 10% ROTCE, subject to the same assumptions we discussed in the
past on a run rate basis at some point next year. And we'll then discuss our plan to continue to increase returns. I
want to thank our employees for continuing to work hard to make Wells Fargo better for our customers,
shareholders, and communities.
I will now turn the call over to Mike.

Thanks, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Charlie summarized how we're helping our customers and
communities on slide 2, so I'm going to start with our third quarter financial results on slide 3.
Net income for the quarter was $5.1 billion, or $1.17 per common share. Our results included a $1.7 billion
decrease in the allowance for credit losses. This is reflective of the continuing improvement in credit performance
and the economic recovery. Pre-tax pre-provision profit grew from a year ago as lower revenue, driven by decline
in net interest income, was more than offset by lower expenses. We continue to execute on our efficiency
initiatives, which has helped improve the expense run rate. And as Charlie highlighted, the third quarter included
$250 million in operating losses associated with the September OCC enforcement action.
Noninterest income was relatively stable from a year ago. Within that, equity gains declined from the second
quarter, but increased $220 million from a year ago, predominantly due to our affiliated venture capital and private
equity businesses. We also had an increase in investment advisory and other asset-based fees from a year ago,
as well as in card, deposit-related, and investment banking fees. These increases were more than offset by
declines in other areas, including lower mortgage banking revenue and lower markets revenue in Corporate and
Investment Banking.
Our effective income tax rate in the third quarter was 22.9%. Our CET1 ratio declined to 11.6% in the third quarter
as we repurchased $5.3 billion of common stock. As a reminder, our regulatory minimum will be 9.1% in the first
quarter of 2022, reflecting a lower G-SIB capital surcharge. Additionally, under the stress capital buffer
framework, we have flexibility to increase capital distributions and, if possible, we will be able to repurchase more

than the $18 billion included in our capital plan over the four-quarter period, depending on market conditions and
other risk factors, including COVID-related risks.
Turning to credit quality on slide 5, our net loan charge-off ratio was 12 basis points in the quarter. Commercial
credit performance continued to improve, and net loan charge-offs declined $42 million from the second quarter to
3 basis points. The improvement was broad-based and included modest net recoveries in our energy portfolio and
in Commercial Real Estate.
The Commercial Real Estate portfolio has continued to perform well. The recovery in retail and hotel properties
reflected increased liquidity and improved valuations. While we have not seen any widespread stress in office, we
continue to watch this sector closely and believe that any impact as a result of return-to-office or hybrid working
plans will take time to play out.
Consumer credit performance also continued to improve, with strong collateral values for homes and autos, and
consumer cash reserves remaining above pre-pandemic levels. Net loan charge-offs declined $80 million from the
second quarter to 23 basis points. We continue to have net recoveries in our Consumer Real Estate portfolios,
and losses in both credit card and auto declined.
Nonperforming assets declined $321 million, or 4%, from the second quarter, driven by lower commercial
nonaccruals with clients across all asset types. Energy was the largest driver given significant improvement in
fundamentals on the back of higher commodity prices. Our allowance level at the end of the third quarter reflected
continued strong credit performance, the continuing economic recovery, and the uncertainties that still remain. If
current economic trends continue, we would expect to have additional reserve releases.
On slide 6, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans were relatively stable from the second quarter, with a
decline in residential mortgage loans largely offset by modest growth in most of our consumer and commercial
portfolios. Total period-end loans grew for the first time since the first quarter of 2020 and were up $10.5 billion
from the second quarter with growth in commercial and industrial loans, auto, other consumer, credit card, and
Commercial Real Estate.
Average deposits increased $51.9 billion, or 4%, from a year ago, with growth in our Consumer businesses and
Commercial Banking, partially offset by continued declines in Corporate and Investment Banking and Corporate
Treasury, reflecting targeted actions to manage under the asset cap.
Turning to net interest income on slide 7. Net interest income grew $109 million, or 1%, from the second quarter
and was down $470 million, or 5%, from a year ago. The decrease from a year ago was driven by lower loan
balances and the impact of lower yields on earning assets, partially offset by a decline in long-term debt and lower
premium amortization on our mortgage-backed securities.
We had $20 billion of loans we purchased out of mortgage-backed securities, or EPBOs, at the end of the third
quarter, down $4 billion from the second quarter. These loans do contribute to net interest income, and we expect
these EPBO loan balances to decline substantially by the end of 2022.
At the end of the third quarter, we also had $4.7 billion of PPP loans outstanding, and we expect the balances to
steadily decline over the next several quarters and to be under $1 billion by the end of next year. We continue to
expect net interest income to be near the bottom of our initial guidance range of flat to down 4% from the
annualized fourth quarter 2020 level of $36.8 billion for the full year.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2021
Turning to expenses on slide 8. Noninterest expense declined 13% from a year ago. The decrease was driven by
lower restructuring charges and operating losses, and the progress we've made on our efficiency initiatives.
During the first nine months of this year, these initiatives have helped to drive a 16% decline in professional and
outside services expense by reducing our spend on consultants and contractors; an 8% reduction in occupancy
costs by reducing the number of locations including branches and offices; occupancy costs have also declined
from lower COVID-19-related costs; and a 5% decline in salaries expense by eliminating management layers and
increasing expansion controls across the organization and optimizing branch staffing.
Now, let me provide some specific examples of progress we're making on some of the initiatives. We are
continuing to work on reducing the underlying costs to run our Consumer Banking business. The pandemic
accelerated customer migration to digital, which continue with mobile logons up 14% in the third quarter from a
year ago. While teller transactions were flat from a year ago, they were over 30% lower than pre-pandemic levels,
as transactions have migrated to ATMs and mobile.
Over the past year, we've reduced our number of branches by 433, or 8%, and lowered head count in branch
banking by 23%. We continue to focus on generating efficiencies in our branches and have a number of initiatives
designed to further reduce expenses, including reducing cash handling time and simplifying certain branch
processes.
Wealth and Investment Management has had strong increases in revenue-related compensation; however, by
executing on efficiency initiatives, nonrevenue-related expenses in the third quarter declined 6% from a year ago
and non-advisor head count was down 10% from a year ago. We have aligned our Wealth Management business
under eight divisional leaders, creating better coordination and efficiency. We have also implemented a more
efficient client service model across all distribution channels, and have reduced total square footage by
rationalizing our real estate footprint.
Corporate and Investment Banking has continued to make progress on various efficiency initiatives. These efforts
include reducing head count supporting products, regions, or sectors with low levels of market activity and
opportunity; optimizing operations and support teams; vendor optimization and insourcing; and reducing spend on
contractors and consultants.
We're also working on initiatives in centralized functions, including operations, where we have realized savings
from location optimization, lower third-party spending by eliminating consulting arrangements, and consolidating
vendors. The operations group has also reduced [ph] spends on layers (00:19:50) with savings coming from
eliminating manager roles. Automation efforts and strategy enhancements have driven process improvements
while reducing costs in many areas, including fraud management and card collections. We've also been working
on additional opportunities through technology enablement that have longer lead times but should result in
benefits that we expect will reduce operations-related expenses over time.
With three quarters of actual results already, our current outlook for 2021 expenses, excluding restructuring
charges and the cost of business exits, is approximately $53.5 billion. Note that we had $193 million of
restructuring charges and cost of business exits during the first nine months of the year. This outlook includes an
expectation of higher operating losses and higher revenue-related expenses than we assumed earlier in the year.
Our expense outlook also assumes a full year of expenses related to Wells Fargo Asset Management and our
Corporate Trust Services business, and we expect these sales to close during the fourth quarter. We will update
you on the expense impact of these initiatives after they close.

As mentioned, the outlook accounts for the fact that we expect full year operating losses to be approximately
$250 million higher than our assumptions at the beginning of the year. This includes approximately $1 billion of
operating losses incurred during the first nine months of the year, and our outlook assumes $250 million of
operating losses in the fourth quarter. Just a reminder that operating losses can be lumpy and unpredictable,
especially as we continue to address the significant work needed to satisfy our regulatory requirements.
Our current outlook also assumes revenue-related compensation will be approximately $1 billion this year which
is higher than the $500 million we assumed at the beginning of the year. Strong equity markets have driven
revenue-related expenses, which is a good thing as the associated revenue more than offsets any increase in
expenses.
Now, turning to our business segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on slide 9. Consumer and
Small Business Banking revenue increased 2% from a year ago primarily due to an increase in consumer activity,
including higher debit card transactions and lower COVID-related fee waivers. Home Lending revenue declined
20% from a year ago primarily due to a decline in mortgage banking income, driven by lower gain on sale
margins, origination volumes, and servicing fees.
Net interest income also declined driven by lower loan balances. These declines were partially offset by higher
gains from the re-securitization of loans we purchased from mortgage-backed securities last year. Credit Card
revenue was up 4% from a year ago driven by increased spending and lower customer accommodations and fee
waivers in response to the pandemic. Auto revenue increased 10% from a year ago on higher loan balances.
Turning to some key business drivers on slide 10; our mortgage originations declined 2% from the second
quarter, with corresponding originations growing 2% which was more than offset by a 5% decline in retail. We
currently expect our fourth quarter originations to decline modestly given the recent increase in mortgage rates
and the typical seasonal trends in the purchase market.
Despite strong consumer demand for autos, inventory shortages are putting downward pressure on industry sales
and driving higher prices. The competitive environment has remained relatively stable, and we've had our second
consecutive quarter of record originations, with volume up 70% from a year ago.
Turning to debit cards, transactions were relatively stable from the second quarter and up 11% from a year ago,
with increases across nearly all categories. We had strong growth in new credit card accounts, up 63% from the
second quarter, driven by the launch of our new Active Cash card. Credit card point-of-sale purchase volume was
up 24% from a year ago and 4% from the second quarter. While payment rates remain high, average balances
grew 3% from the second quarter, the first time balances have grown since the fourth quarter of 2020.
Turning to Commercial Banking results on slide 11; Middle Market Banking revenue declined 3% from a year ago
primarily due to lower loan balances and lower interest rates, which were partially offset by higher deposit
balances and deposit-related fees. Asset-Based Lending and Leasing revenue declined 12% from a year ago
driven by lower loan balances and lower lease income.
Noninterest expense declined 14% from a year ago, primarily driven by lower salaries and consulting expense
due to efficiency initiatives, as well as lower lease expense. After declining for four consecutive quarters, average
loans stabilized in the third quarter. Line utilizations remain low, and loan demand continue to be impacted by low
client inventory levels and strong client cash positions. However, there was some increase in demand late in the
quarter and period-end balances increased $1.6 billion, or 1%, from the second quarter.

Turning to Corporate and Investment Banking on slide 12; in Banking, total revenue increased 12% from a year
ago. This growth was driven by higher advisory and equity origination fees and an increase in loan balances,
partially offset by lower deposit balances, predominately due to actions taken to manage under the asset cap.
Commercial Real Estate revenue grew 10% from a year ago driven by higher commercial servicing income, loan
balances, and capital markets results on stronger commercial gain on sale volumes and margins and higher
underwriting fees. Markets revenue declined 15% from a year ago driven by lower trading activity across most
asset classes, primarily due to market conditions. Noninterest expense declined 10% from a year ago primarily
driven by reduced operations expense due to efficiency initiatives.
Wealth and Investment Management revenue, on slide 13, grew 10% from a year ago. A decline in net interest
income due to lower interest rates was more than offset by higher asset-based fees primarily due to higher market
valuations. Revenue-related compensation drove the increase in noninterest expense from a year ago. I
highlighted earlier the progress we've made on efficiency initiatives to reduce nonrevenue-related expenses,
including salaries and occupancy expense.
Client assets increased 13% from a year ago primarily driven by higher market valuations. Average deposits were
up 4% from a year ago and average loans increased 5% from a year ago driven by continued momentum in
securities-based lending.
And then slide 14 highlights our Corporate results. Revenue declined from a year ago driven by lower net interest
income, primarily due to the sale of our student loan portfolio and lower noninterest income due to lower gains on
the sale of securities in our investment portfolio. The decline in revenue from the second quarter was primarily
driven by lower equity gains from our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses. And expenses
included the $250 million operating loss associated with the OCC enforcement action in September.
With that, we will now take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: At this time, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first
question will come from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, I was hoping you could sort of address the cost outlook. I
certainly appreciate the commentary regarding the fourth quarter in particular. And I think, as we look forward, you
guys have had the expectation that costs could come down year-over-year for the next couple of years. I mean
that, of course, puts you guys in a very unique position vis-à-vis many of your peers.
But so many people are talking about things like wage inflation right now. Just curious, to what degree are you
seeing that? And, more importantly, is there enough flexibility in your existing outlook sets that, even despite
higher wage pressures, you could still see costs down year-over-year for the next couple of years?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Sure. This is Charlie. Thanks for the question. I guess, let me start with the wage inflation. I think we certainly are
seeing wage inflation. I would say it's very different across different parts of the company, and very different
across different job categories that we have. And so, as we approach it, we're trying to be very thoughtful about
ensuring that we're continuing to be as fair with people as we can be, as well as paying competitively.
We actually are making awards to people in our branches which equate to roughly $2.50 an hour from the
beginning of October through the end of the year to thank them for what they're doing, but also address the
competitiveness that exists out there; and we're evaluating what makes sense for the longer-term.
And in places in the company where we do see wage pressure, we're acting accordingly. But I would not say that
it's something that we see everywhere across the entire company in every single job. But we're certainly prepared
for it and look at it very, very regularly as we look at things like attrition and whatnot.
To the broader question, I think – well, first of all, we're in the middle of doing our budgets now, as I'm sure you
hear from everyone when they do these calls at this time of year. Our goal is still the same that we've said in the
past, which is we still would like to see net reductions in the overall expense base. We are in a unique position in
that I would say in two ways.
First of all, we do have the significant amount that we're spending on regulatory orders, and we're not assuming
that we get efficiencies out of that in the near future. But one day when we've built all that's required, that will be
an opportunity for us, but that's not even on the radar screen for us right now. But we still have just tremendous
excess expenses across the company.
You can see it in head count, you can see it in efficiency ratios across the businesses. And what I found here is
the same thing I think that Mike and I have seen at a lot of other places, which is it's like peeling an onion back.
You think you see what's incredibly clear. Once you actually get rid of those inefficiencies, you then start to see
the next level. And it becomes part of the culture, and we engage the entire company in moving that way.

So, we still think that there are extremely meaningful efficiencies that we can pursue for quite some time here,
which hopefully will both allow us to have net reductions but also invest appropriately, whether it's in technology or
products, which as we've said we're extremely focused on as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect. Thank you very much. And then I was hoping, Mike, you might be able to expand on a comment you
made about loan demand improving later in the quarter. There seems to be a little bit of a divergence emerging
between the kind of demand we're seeing at, say, smaller and middle-market companies, for instance, versus
what we're seeing with larger corporates that might have better access to the capital markets. Curious, if you can
just provide a little more color where you're seeing that improved demand, please?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. And I assume we will see some divergence across different – some of the peers as you sort of look at this.
But if you look at the Commercial Bank as an example, we're actually seeing the demand in the pipeline build in
kind of the middle and upper end of the client base, with a little bit less of demand emerging so far on lower end,
which I know is counter to what you – the way you asked the question. But I think that's what we're seeing right
now.
And I think in part that's because the clients in the lower end of our client base still have a lot of excess liquidity,
and they're still dealing with supply chain crunches and other issues that are sort of impacting their need for
liquidity, need for credit. And I think that we'll start to see more demand I think more consistently across the client
base over time as things play out, but that's what we're seeing in the Commercial Bank.
I think when you look more broadly and you look at the Consumer side, we have seen balances grow in Auto,
we've seen them in Card. When you look through the Home Lending data that we give you, we are seeing growth
on our kind of core nonconforming mortgage book as well. That's offset by the declines in the loans that we
bought out from securities last year. But we are seeing some growth there, too.
And then you see some growth in the Corporate and Investment Bank, and that's really a little bit of a lot of things
happening across the Corporate and Investment Bank whether it's real estate, subscription finance, and other
sectors that are really driving some of that growth. And so, again, it's still relatively modest so far in terms of what
we've seen, and I think it'll take some more time for it to really play out in a more meaningful way; but it's
encouraging to start to see at least a little bit manifest so far.

And I would just encourage you to make sure that you look at the period-end balances as well as the averages,
because it certainly gets to the heart of the question. And then just one final thing I'll say on this, which is we're
not stretching in any way in terms of credit, or pricing, or things like that to try and get to a result. We're continuing
to have the same disciplines that we've always had, and it's going to be a question of our balances are rising
because of greater customer activity.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, guys. Thanks. Good morning. Just wondering, Mike, if you could just talk a little bit about just some of the ins
and outs on underneath NII outside from balance sheet movements. Meaning, you saw little bit of increase in
premium am. Can you just remind us, like, how that mechanism works in terms of what rates need to do to have a
ongoing improvement there? And are you at the point – or how close are you to the point where your incremental
purchases or replacements on the securities book are getting closer to what's rolling off? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. Thanks, Ken. I think when you think about premium amortization, I think you said it backwards, but, like,
we're getting a benefit from premium amortization coming down in the quarter. And you saw that in our results as
roughly $90 million, a little bit – or maybe a couple bucks less. And so, as we've been saying, we expect that to
continue to come down. I think it'll be somewhat gradual as we look at the next couple of quarters. You're not
going to see big step-downs. I think it'll come down, again, in the fourth quarter, maybe a little less than we saw
from the second to the third quarter.
And as rates – as you've seen over the last three months, rates have been a little all over the place. And so, it's a
bit of a function of where mortgage rates are, and there's a little bit of a lag to it as it comes through the data. But
we still expect the general trajectory to be coming down on premium amortization; it's just a matter of exactly how
fast and over what time period that'll happen.
I think on the second part of the question – what was the second part, again, Ken, the...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Just about reinvestment rates versus the underlying portfolio on the securities book.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, no. And, again, even on that, I keep reminding people; as you sort of look at the third quarter and rates
were much, much lower than they are today for most of the second quarter. And so, really, we've seen them rally
at the tail end of the quarter and kind of stabilize to come down slightly since then over the last week or so. And
so that gap is closing, obviously, in terms of what's rolling off and getting closer to kind of the overall average in
the portfolio. But we still have a little ways to go for reinvestment rates to match sort of what's rolling out of the
portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Got it. And just last quick one, just long-term debt, you've been meaningfully reducing the footprint and
helped by the mix improving on the balance sheet. How much more of an opportunity is that to continue to lower
the long-term debt footprint and reduce the cost of it? Thanks, Mike.

Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. Yeah. No, it's a good question. And I think our constraint's going to be TLAC, how much TLAC we have to
hold. And I think you can probably model that out a little bit. So, we have a little bit more room to go to continue to
optimize the mix here and bring the long-term debt down, but it's likely at some point next year that'll start to
change.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi. Good afternoon. So, wanted to ask a follow up on Ken's last line of questioning around the NII outlook. And if I
take all the different component pieces that you mentioned and just throw it in the blender, so more constructive
loan growth commentary, some modest but steady premium am benefit, but still some reinvestment headwinds. Is
it reasonable to expect that you can grow NII versus the lower end of the guidance range for 2021? And,
separately, what's your appetite to deploy excess liquidity, just given your excess reserves parked at the Fed, at
least as a percentage of the overall balance sheet, is still quite elevated relative to many of your peers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. Maybe I'll start with the second one and I'll come back to the first part, Steve. As we think about
redeployment, we're still being pretty patient. And as I just mentioned to Ken's question, you look at what's been
happening over the last few months, rates were much lower. They rallied recently. At the same time, the basis
between treasuries and mortgages has actually compressed a bit. So, it made them a little bit relatively more
expensive. And if you look at what's happening in inflation and with tapering coming, we still think that there is
more risk to upside on rates than there is downside at this point. And so we're still being patient as we sort of look
at our redeployment there.
And when opportunities present themselves, we'll take advantage of them. And we did that a little bit right at the
end of the third quarter where we accelerated some purchases that we were making, given the spike and the rally
that we saw there. And so we'll continue to do that, but we're going to be patient as we see how would things
develop over the coming months.
As you sort of think about the range for the full year, we've been giving a range for a reason, right, because
there's a lot of moving pieces, right, and there's still a few months to play out. And I think if we obviously see
faster loan growth than we expect, that will be a positive. But if we see rates move a little bit higher than what the
forward curve has, that will be positive. We still have to – just to keep up with where the securities portfolio, we
have a lot of purchases to make in the fourth quarter. And so, where rates end up throughout will be important.
And then on the margin, there's things like PPP and other factors that sort of drive that, and that will be
determined based on the client forgiveness trends that we see in our client base. So I think there are scenarios
where we could be a little bit better than what we projected there, and there's some scenarios where we could be
a little bit worse depending on how all those factors play out.

John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Hi. I wanted to follow up on the expenses. When we think about the aspiration for expenses to be down next year
and understanding that you're going through budgeting and that's a goal right now, Mike, can we think of it is
that's your goal kind of relative to the $53.5 billion and wouldn't include help from the business exits?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. John, no. I think we think about the business exits just separate from the core efficiency we're driving. And
for lack of a better way to describe it, if we think that there's going to be a savings of X dollars as these
businesses roll off, take the $53.5 billion and subtract the X, and that will be our new goal...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A

A new starting place.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A

A new starting place, yeah. And we gave you at a high level some detail about that in April, and when these close
and we've got good clarity on it, we'll be very transparent about how to reset the baseline and the starting point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Sure. And in terms of – you expect some gains on sales, I assume those are – you're thinking the same lines. And
those should probably come in the fourth quarter is what you're currently thinking?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. They may not all be in the fourth quarter, given how the deals were structured, like, not 100% of the gains
will be in the fourth quarter, but a good chunk of it will be in the fourth quarter. And, obviously, we'll be clear on
what that was when it happens.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. And the last thing from me is if we want to dream about loan growth coming back to the industry, how do
we think about how much capacity you have to grow loans while staying under the asset cap? And where does
that come from? Does it come from cash liquidity mix and moving other stuff around the balance sheet? Can you
just give us some thoughts on that?

Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. We all dream of faster loan growth, so I think we're aligned there. Look, I think we've got plenty of room to
grow on the loan side. And whether it comes initially from cash that's sitting at the Fed, that would be kind of the
first place. But if we needed to, we could reduce the securities portfolio as well if it grew much faster than what we
expected. That would be a nice problem to have. But at this point, we have plenty of capacity to grow.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. I guess just one big picture question, Charlie. Appreciate you mentioning the risk of setbacks
as you go through the whole regulatory process. At the same time when we talk to investors, I think there's
[indiscernible] (00:43:05) the longer you steer within that asset cap. I was wondering if you could address, just in
terms of when we think about the franchise both from a talent and client standpoint, how worried should your
shareholders be about that, or do you think that's well taken care of?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Well, I think it's – I would say I do think it's well taking care of, I'll start there. But I think we think about it every day
that we take actions to stay below the cap. I think as Mike just spoke about, we have significant room on the asset
side of the balance sheet, which is where you really want to be there for clients where they need you. And so
when you're out hustling for business, we're certainly able to fulfill their needs; doesn't matter whether it's
Consumer or whether it's Corporate.
Our experience has been that we continue to find ways to optimize the balance sheet in a way that has very little
client impact. And where we have to move deposits off the balance sheet, we work with customers to come up
with other off-balance-sheet solutions for them. And I think our experience has been that customers are very, very
understanding of what that is. So, again, I think as we think about – and by the way, we have not limited the
growth of deposits on the Consumer side at all.
So, when we think about there were long-term impacts, I think we certainly would have liked to have been in a
different position if we had a choice, but we're trying to be very smart about having as little franchise impact as
possible when we make these decisions and make sure we're communicating with customers. And I think the
people here at Wells have done an amazing job of striking that right balance. And as I said, I think we're as open
for business as anyone on the asset side, and I think customers appreciate that as well.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. No, thanks for sharing that perspective. And just one quick one, Mike, on the NII. When we look at the
fourth quarter, on your full-year guidance, does the net/net of all of that imply that fourth quarter NII should at least
grow from third quarter levels? And can you disclose what the PPP impact was for the third quarter NII number?

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2021
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. I think on the fourth quarter, you can model, like, based on what your assumptions are, right? And as I said,
we'll be sort of near the bottom of the range, and you can sort of pick where you think we'll be based on how you
feel about it. I think for third quarter, the PPP impact was about $115 million. And just to give you a little context,
that was a little bit lower than what we saw in the second quarter, and we would expect the fourth quarter to be a
little bit lower than that potentially. But that'll all be based on how clients – the pace of forgiveness requests that
we get from clients. But, overall, a pretty small sequential impact, and that's all baked into our forecast.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. On the expense side, how should we think about the timing and the magnitude of the remaining
$4.3 billion in cost saves? And would you say that any of the latest regulatory developments impacted how you're
thinking about the magnitude or the timing of the realization of those saves? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, John. It's Mike. As we said in the beginning of the year, we were going to get about $3.7 billion of the $8
billion this year, and the annualized impact starts to build as you go through the year. So, some of that you get in
the run rate coming out of 2021, and some of that will take more time to get at. And as I mentioned, where we
have to introduce new technology or other new capabilities, it just takes longer to get at some of it. And as we sort
of said at the beginning of the year, this is a multi-year plan. So we're not going to get all of that in the first 12
months by any stretch. And as we get to January, we'll give you a better view of what to expect on 2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Got it. And then separately on the loan front, can you just maybe give us a little more detail on the trends
you're seeing in the card business, including spending volume as well as payment rates? And then separately,
any thoughts on the impact of the buy now, pay later product on how you're thinking about your product set?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. I think when you look at payment rates, they're still really high. Like, they bounce around little bit month-to-
month in the last quarter or so, but they're still really high. And so, what you're getting – when you look at the
balance growth you're seeing, you're really getting that through an increase in the point-of-sale purchase volumes
that are coming through.
Charlie highlighted a bunch of stats based on what we're seeing in the book, but I'd say overall spend patterns –
spend is still pretty strong, pretty stable from where we saw in the second quarter, up versus the comparable

period last year or in 2019. And as you'd expect in any given week or month or quarter, the different categories
move around quite a bit depending on what's happening based on that time period.
And then I think when you look at – so you can see that point-of-sale volumes are up 24% from the quarter a year
ago, 4% sequentially, and you can see the new account growth which is up quite a bit, 150% from a year ago and
63% from the second quarter based on the new products we've launched. So, I'd characterize it as still really
strong activity levels despite the noise you see out there related to the Delta variant and other things.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
This is Charlie. On buy now, pay later, I would say – I would describe buy now, pay later as another option of
providing credit and serving the merchant. I think as others have said, it's still overall a relatively small portion of
the market, but I think there'll be a place for it but it's not going to supplant all the other types of credit that exist
out there. We have our own retail services business, we have our own personal lending business, and we've got a
significant number of merchant relationships ourselves. So it's a place that we will be in addition to the products
that we have.
And over time, my guess is it will continue – you're seeing a proliferation of people involved now. At some time, at
some point, it will become far more consolidated for all the reasons that these other industries have been
consolidated, including those that can really provide a differentiated experience for the merchant. So, hopefully
that helps.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hey, guys. Charlie, I wanted to follow up again on the comment about likely to have additional setbacks from the
regulatory stuff, and just to push here for a little bit, if you don't mind. Is this kind of like a broad risk statement just
in case; like, you never know? Or should we just be prepared for something more meaningful, whether it's a
speed bump or a potential landmine between here and specifically the end of the asset cap, which I think
everyone views as the key turning point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. I guess, I would describe it this way; everyone focuses on the asset cap, and I understand all the reasons
for that, for sure. And I think just what's important to us is that we want to make sure that there's complete
transparency, which we believe we have if you read our 10-Q. But also, we want to make sure that you're just
thinking about the broad set of things that we're dealing with.
And the reality is the asset cap embedded in the said consent order is one very important order, but we still have
other consent orders with other agencies which are still extraordinarily important. We have other inquiries that are
in progress that are described in there. And so I just think it's important that we're completely transparent. It's
nothing different than what we've been saying. And when you talk about speed bump versus landmines, hopefully

we all work to make sure that we minimize the likelihood of a landmine. But as I said before, the intricateness on
just on the pure amount of things that we have to do are complex.
We're judged on practices that were in place years ago as well as practices that are in place today, and we're
judged based upon the overall progress based upon the initial due dates of some of these things. And so, nothing
changes my perspective about net-net are we moving forward? I absolutely believe we are. And we're able to see
all the internal metrics, every interim date, and things like that which the outsiders can't see. But we choose our
words very carefully on things like that.
And so, I just want to make sure that people understand that we have these things that are out there, and don't
want you to be surprised if something happens. But it doesn't change our point of view of what the opportunity is
and how confident we are about being able to close these things.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And as a follow-up, I know you can't tell us what the conversation kind of content is with the regulators, but can
you at least tell us, like, do you have like the point of conversation, like, on the asset cap, we submitted the plan,
you accepted it, like, how long is this going to take? We all, just from the outside, try to understand, like, what the
level of communication is, because I think on some fronts there's a lot of communication, like the OCC I think sits
in all the banks' offices, so there's a lot of regular communication there. But with the Fed and the asset cap, it's
kind of like, is there any conversation about it even if you can't tell us specifically what it is?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. So a couple things. First of all, we have – and I think this is not just us; I think this is true of all banks. We
have regular conversations with all of our regulators. Absolutely with the OCC, as you say. There are many
examiners in our offices on a regular basis. But we have an extremely open and interactive relationship with the
CFPB, with the Fed, with the FDIC, and all other appropriate regulators, including the SEC, FINRA, overseas
regulators; and that is the way we treat the relationships.
I have found the Fed to be clear, consistent, in their approach to issues that relate to supervision. I think that's just
a general comment that I would say. I haven't seen things deviate from that. And as I've said, when I look at the
consent order, it doesn't say submit a plan and then we'll talk about lifting the asset cap. It describes in there what
we have to do. And so, you should just assume that there is we have a constant level of engagement, that we're
really clear on what we have to do, and we're doing the work to get there.

Thank you. Mike, can you share with us, your credit quality is very strong, similar to many in the industry. Your net
charge-off ratio, of course, was an incredibly low 12 basis points. Do have an idea how long you could kind of
sustain such a strong level of net charge-offs, and when it may reach a more normalized level some time looking

out? And then, second, your reserves relative to loans I think were about 170 basis points. And when we go back
to that day one CECL number that you guys put out in January of 2020, it was about 93 basis points. And that
difference, you're about the widest of all your peers. So any thoughts on just where the reserve could go as well?
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. Thanks, Gerard. A couple of things. I think so far, we've all in the industry been wrong about when credit or
how credit will normalize. And at some point, I think we all expect that we're going to get back to more normal
charge-off rates. Now, having said that, the new normal might be different if people keep higher – sustain higher
liquidity balances throughout time. So, I think that's something to still play out.
I think at this point, as Charlie highlighted in his script, people still have high liquidity balances. We're seeing high
payoff rates in credit cards and other loans. And so, there's no reason to think that we shouldn't continue to have
strong credit performance in the near term. It may not be 12 basis points, but it should still be historically quite
strong at least in the near term, and we'll see how it starts to normalize.
I think as it – go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Just let me add one thing on that. I just think that when we think about long-term earnings power of the company
and we talk about our ability to get sustainable return numbers, we assume that the charge-off number will go up
from there. So we agree it's extremely low, that it won't stay here. And just as you think about when we think
about our returns, we make adjustments for that. And so, if they do start to rise next year, then it'll be hopefully in
our assumptions. And if not, then we'll get there sooner maybe, but we'll explain why.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. And as it relates to the coverage ratio today, as we've said for the last couple of quarters, we continue to be
reserved for a whole number of different scenarios. And it hopefully will prove out to be very conservative relative
to what plays out over the coming quarters. And if we continue to see trends continue, we'll have more releases
as we go.
I think whether you get back to day one CECL levels or not, I think is a really almost impossible question to
answer, given it's going to be a function of all the variables you now have to consider and what your outlook is,
what the different risks are at that time. And if you go back to first quarter of 2020, I think we had, what, 3.5%
unemployment at that point. And it was a very – well, I think, pre-COVID, it was a very kind of utopian
environment, I think, from an economic perspective. And so, will we get back to exactly that outlook? Hard to say.
But I think we continue to think if things play out, we'll have more releases and that number will go down.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2021
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. Look, as we highlighted, Gerard, we think that's a really big opportunity over a long period of time, but it
doesn't happen in a quarter or two. It takes some time to really make sure that we've got those relationships built
out in the way we want. We really started to put some extra focus on it in a very disciplined way late last year. So,
I'd say we're still early. I think we're seeing some encouraging green shoots where we've had some opportunities
that we've won over the last few months or couple of quarters that we might not have been in a position to have
before that. But it'll take some time to play out, but we do think the opportunity is pretty big.

Hi. How are you doing?

Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Hey, Betsy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Two questions. One on the branch network, just wanted to get your updated thoughts on how you see your
footprint today. And is there more of an opportunity to expand or to optimize?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
That's a good question, Betsy. I think we're actually doing a bunch of work on exactly what that looks like because
we have been very, very focused on net reductions, given the fact that we were behind some others. And so, the
team has done a great work in just terms of identifying – we'll describe them as just we had a significant number
of very obvious consolidation opportunities. They're really not closures. They're really consolidation where we
have the appropriate local coverage.
I think the work that we're doing is to really think through at this point where we have significant share, where we
have less share, but we have enough concentration. What our footprint looks like in some of those places to
figure out how we can actually reorient the existing number of branches that we have over a period of time.
So I think the reality is we will continue to optimize, because as time goes on, we will continue to need less. We're
focused on not leaving communities that need our help without solutions. We're going to certainly wind up with
smaller footprints in a lot of the places because branch usage is changing. But we will use that as an opportunity
to figure out how to redeploy some of those resources as well.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2021
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then I have the same question on your Wealth platform. I know you recently brought in Barry to run
that, and just want to understand the strategy there if you don't mind.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Sure. I think we've got – the strategy falls into kind of four distinct buckets. Number one is we have our – think of it
as our independent broker channel, where it's the old A.G. Edwards and businesses like that, Wheat First that
came together to form that network. We have then financial advisors that work extremely closely with our bank
branches, and believe that's still a relatively untapped opportunity for us.
We also have a platform where brokers can actually go in – when I say independent, that was a wrong phrase in
the beginning. Those are people who are employees, but we have a platform where people can actually go
independent and continue to do the business through us. And then we have our online business, WellsTrade.
And so, we've got those distinct different points of distribution, and we're focused equally on maximizing the value
that existed in all of those. Historically, I think we ran it much more as just one big opportunity, and I think we feel
like we have underinvested in the online piece and the independent piece, for sure. And the bank branch piece is
something which we think is, as I said, just a very meaningful opportunity given the amount of affluent customers
that we have in our branch footprint.

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Your
line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi, Charlie. Kind of go back to the regulatory consent orders, just want to get a sense from you. Given the setback
we had this quarter with the additional consent order, you've obviously spent a lot on these. You've hired, you've
brought in a lot of folks already since you've been there over the last two years, a lot of consultants, a lot of in-
house people. So, what do you need to do differently, especially you as a management team, to not have more of
those setbacks and to have it go in the direction you were hoping it would go with this?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. I would say, Vivek, there's nothing new that we have to do as far as reaching an endpoint. So if you said,
pre-consent order or post-consent order, does it change we have to do to build out the right capabilities with the
right controls, in this case in mortgage? The answer is absolutely not. And so, again, whether or not it's being

done fast enough in the regulators' minds relative to how long some of these things have been going on, which
predate many of us, that's the context which they need to look at this in because that's who they regulate and how
they have regulated.
So, again, I think for us and I'm not minimizing a consent order – a consent order is a very big deal – but the work
that's embedded in there, the end state is the same end state that we would have contemplated building
ourselves. And so, there's a lot more formality that's part of the process now, and the OCC will be more deeply
involved in the series of the checkpoints and things like that. And there certainly is some more work that comes
out of an exercise like that, but the end state is the same.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
And so, when you say several years, Charlie, either should we be thinking of that in terms of is it a three-year
timeframe, is it a five-year timeframe? Just, you're right; we've all been dealing with this before you got there, so it
has already been five-plus years. So any sense of direction there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Listen, I don't want to – again – in a perfect world, we'd lay out all of our plans for everyone, but we're obviously
not in a position to do that. And I think what I would just encourage you to do is look at the things that we've
closed. Hopefully, you'll continue to see progress as we look forward, and you'll be able to draw judgments based
upon that. And relative to what it means for our business, as I said, we still have a fair amount of flexibility in order
for us to grow fee-based businesses and grow businesses that require balance sheet usage on the asset side.
I can't give you any more specificity other than we don't want to mislead people. And it's not as if we're not
thinking about the future. And so, again, we try and be very careful not to weigh too much on one side or the
other. But we've got a lot of people here that serve customers every day, and every single person isn't working on
a consent order. Many are. We've got a huge amount of resources that are dedicated to it. But as you see, we're
building products in the card business. We're building products in our retail services business. We're doing the
same across the digital platforms across the company.
And as we execute on these items, you build the confidence of the regulators. So, it's not as if you have to wait
until everything is completely done to be able to continue to move forward not just with your confidence but with
their confidence as well. And so, hopefully in terms of the progress that we believe we're making, that's what
we're seeing. And so, you'll see us put all the resources towards these things to minimize the timeframe but get
them done properly at the same time that we're moving the business forward.
