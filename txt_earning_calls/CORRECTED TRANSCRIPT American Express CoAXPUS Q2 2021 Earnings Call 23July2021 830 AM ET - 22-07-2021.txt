Stephen J. Squeri
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Thanks, Vivian, and hello, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Earlier today, we reported
second quarter revenues of $10.2 billion and earnings per share of $2.80. These results reflect an acceleration of
the momentum we've seen in our core business and a strengthening macro environment. Our improving
performance is a clear indication that the steps we've taken to manage the company through the pandemic and
our investments to rebuild growth momentum are paying off. We're particularly pleased with the progress we're
seeing in several key areas, including engaging and retaining our existing customers, acquiring new customers,
continued excellent credit performance, and an acceleration in spending.
Since the onset of the pandemic, we've been investing in short-term value enhancements to several of our
premium products which has helped drive Card Member engagement and contributed to retention levels that
remain higher than the last few years. We've also ramped up our acquisition engine over the past several
quarters, and we're really pleased to see that overall acquisitions of proprietary cards, which include our co-
brands, have continued to increase with 2.4 million new cards acquired in the quarter. In fact, demand for our
premium fee-based products accelerated this quarter, with acquisitions of US consumer and small business
Platinum and Gold cards well above 2019 levels and exceeding prior quarters, contributing to the continued
double-digit growth in net card fees. Early spending on these new accounts is strong.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2021
We're also pleased to see that acquisitions are increasing in many of our co-brand portfolios. For example, as Ed
Bastian mentioned on Delta's earnings call last week, Delta co-brand acquisitions reached 90% of 2019 levels in
Q2.
Turning to credit, we continue to see excellent credit performance with both delinquency and write-off rates
improving further and reaching near historic lows in the quarter. We're also seeing continued improvements in
Card Member spending. Spending recovery accelerated in Q2 with overall billed business volumes growing 51%
in the quarter on an FX-adjusted basis versus last year and exceeding pre-pandemic levels in June. Goods and
services volumes continue to strengthen, increasing 16% globally on an FX-adjusted basis versus Q2 2019.
Travel and entertainment spending also accelerated in the quarter, particularly in the US, where a growing
percentage of the population is now fully vaccinated. In fact, we saw a surge in spending by US consumer Card
Members across all T&E categories, with overall US consumer T&E spending reaching 98% of pre-pandemic
levels in June and continuing to grow into July. T&E spending outside the US continues to recover more slowly
due to lower overall vaccination rates and government-imposed restrictions in some geographies.
In our Consumer business, the largest contributor to spending growth in goods and services came from millennial
and Gen Z customers, and they are also leading the recovery in T&E spending with total spending up over 30%
on an FX-adjusted basis versus 2019 levels in Q2 for this age cohort. In our Commercial business, overall small
and mid-sized enterprise volumes exceeded pre-pandemic levels in Q2 driven by continued strong growth
globally in B2B spending on goods and services, which was up 18% on an FX-adjusted basis versus 2019, while
the T&E recovery also accelerated with the fastest total growth coming from smaller-sized businesses in the US.
We're also seeing solid spending growth in key travel-related co-brand portfolios. Volumes on both Delta and
Hilton co-brand cards increased by double digits versus pre-pandemic levels in the quarter driven by the same
trends of continued strong growth in goods and services spending and an acceleration in the recovery of T&E
spending.
In addition to investing in retention and acquisition activities as a customer-focused company led by innovation, a
key part of our investment strategy is geared towards delivering a continuous stream of differentiated products,
services and capabilities that provide additional value to our current customers and attract new ones to the
franchise. We invest in innovation in a number of ways through internal development, acquisitions, co-brand
relationships and partnerships with both digital start-ups and large well-known brands across a range of
industries.
A great example of our approach to innovation is our strategy for regularly refreshing our unique value
propositions by leveraging our digital ecosystem and our diverse network of partners. On July 1, we marked the
restart of this strategy with the launch of our new enhanced Platinum Card for consumers in the US. The
American Express Platinum Card created the premium card category nearly 40 years ago and has continued to
define the category ever since. We intend to make sure it remains the competitive standard for many years to
come. The reason for Platinum's success over the years, I believe, is two-fold. First is our continual focus on
knowing our customers and delivering value that meets their evolving needs and preferences, and second is our
willingness to change our value propositions even as our products are at the peak of their performance, and that's
the case with our most recent refresh.
Despite just coming off our best quarter ever for US Platinum account acquisitions, we introduced our new US
consumer Platinum Card featuring a broader set of lifestyle benefits while doubling-down on travel-related
benefits. The new benefits are enabled by working with an expanded range of partners as well as the continued
integration of our growing portfolio of digital assets such as Resy and LoungeBuddy. I would note that the last
time we refreshed our US Platinum Card, we doubled the customer base, bringing in a larger number of younger

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2021
Card Members, and our intent with our current refresh is to attract an even broader pool of customers to the
franchise.
In developing the new Platinum Card, we listened to our Card Members and gleaned insights from their spending
behavior to determine what features and benefits would be most relevant for the way they live now. For example,
some of the spending patterns on certain everyday goods and services categories that emerged during the
pandemic such as streaming services and personal fitness have continued into the recovery. This led us to add a
series of annual credits for digital entertainment services and Equinox club memberships or digital subscriptions
to their on-demand app. Our Platinum Card Members have always cared a lot about travel and entertainment.
And as our recent quarterly results demonstrate, our US-based customers are eagerly returning to travel and in-
person dining. So we added a series of new travel-related benefits to the refreshed product on top of those
Platinum Card already offers, including a significant expansion of our proprietary Centurion lounge network and a
new global dining access program powered by Resy, our online reservation platform that provides exclusive
access to some of the world's best restaurants and premium dining experiences.
The enhancements we've made to the US Platinum Card represent a significant increase in value which we
believe will be very attractive to both current and new customers even with an increase in its annual fee. As we
have seen from previous refreshes, customers are willing to pay more for what they see as Platinum's unique
value, and we believe it will be no different in this case. In fact, the very early indications are encouraging.
Applications and acquisitions have outpaced our expectations in the first two weeks since the new Platinum Card
became available. The US Platinum refresh is just one example of how we're leveraging partnerships in our digital
ecosystem to innovate and add differentiated value to our products and services. We'll be refreshing other
products and rolling out new digital capabilities for both consumer and commercial customers throughout the
remainder of the year and beyond.
We're really excited about the new US Platinum Card and the potential that it and other innovations we have in
the pipeline represent, and there are many other reasons why I feel very good about where we are at the halfway
point in the year, including the progress we're making to rebuild momentum in our core business is accelerating
and better than we expected at the beginning of the year. The improvements we're seeing across many of our key
metrics are a sign that our strategy for managing through the pandemic and investing in activities to rebuild our
growth momentum is working. We're particularly pleased with the strength we're seeing in customer retention,
new account acquisitions, credit performance and overall spending volumes, with goods and services volumes
now well above pre-pandemic levels globally, and travel and entertainment spending recovering faster than we
expected driven by significant improvement in the United States.
Taking all of these factors together, we're increasingly optimistic that the strength that we've seen in our core
business through the first half will continue, particularly in the US, even as the pace of recovery remains uneven
in different regions around the world. With this in mind, we remain committed to executing our investment strategy
for growing our business over the long-term. And based on current trends, we're confident in our ability to be
within the high end of the range of EPS expectations we had for 2020 in 2022 and to resume our financial growth
algorithm beyond 2022.
Now I'll turn it over to Jeff who will discuss our second quarter results in detail, and then we'll take your questions.
Thank you.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2021
Well, thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here today to talk about our second quarter
results, which reflect strong momentum in the recovery of our core business and great progress towards our 2022
financial objectives. Starting with our summary financials on slide 2, second quarter revenues of $10.2 billion were
up 31% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis as we lapped the trough of the billings and revenue declines that
occurred during the most significant pandemic lockdowns in Q2 of last year. Our second quarter net income was
$2.3 billion and earnings per share was $2.80. These strong results were, of course, in part driven by an $866
million credit reserve release as we saw continued strong credit performance and some improvements in the
macroeconomic outlook.
Now, as I turn to a more detailed look at our results, I'll again focus on what we see as the key drivers of our great
progress towards our 2022 financial objectives, volumes, credit trends, and the marketing investments we are
making to build growth momentum. As we've said all year, 2021 itself is a transition year, positioning us for 2022
and beyond. So let's now get into the first key driver to watch as we measure our progress this year, volumes,
which you will see several views of on slides 3 through 9. You will note that we have shown second quarter
volume trends on both a year-over-year basis and relative to 2019 as we find this provides a clearer picture of
how spending is recovering on the way to our 2022 financial objectives. And that clear picture on slide 3 shows an
acceleration in the pace of recovery across all of our volumes in the second quarter with total network volumes
and billed business volumes up around 50% year-over-year as we lapped the trough of the billings declines from
Q2 2020.
Importantly, relative to 2019, total network volumes, billed business and processed volumes were all down just
2% on an FX-adjusted basis and surpassed pre-COVID levels for the month of June. The acceleration in billed
business is being driven by both spending on goods and services which was up 16% versus 2019, as you can
see on slide 4, and by a notable improvement in spending on travel and entertainment in the second quarter.
Overall T&E spending reached nearly 70% of 2019 levels as we exited Q2. This is a level we originally expected
we would not reach until the fourth quarter of this year, so to see it recovering more quickly than we had expected
and without it coming at the cost of any slowing in the growth in goods and services spending is a positive
indicator for us.
Turning to slide 5, you do see that the billed business volume recovery is being led by the US which surpassed
2019 levels and was up 3% in the quarter. The recovery in total billed business volumes outside of the US is
weaker. Interestingly though, you see on the top right of slide 5 that the growth in goods and services spending
has been strong in both the US and outside of the US. Overall spend is weaker outside the US because
historically, we have more travel-related spending in our international regions and international T&E is recovering
more slowly due to lower vaccination rates and continued government restrictions in certain geographies.
Focusing in then on just our Consumer business on slide 6, you see that overall spending was 4% above 2019
levels in the quarter as growth in goods and services volumes accelerated to 18% versus 2019, and we continue
to see strong online and card-not-present spend growth, demonstrating the lasting effect of the behavioral
changes we've seen during the pandemic even as offline spending recovered to pre-pandemic levels.
In our Commercial business, as you can see on slide 7, global SME spending, which represents the bulk of our
commercial billed business remains the most resilient across all of our customer types with spend up 6% versus
2019 for the quarter. This performance was supported by continued growth in B2B spending on goods and
services which was up 18% versus 2019. In contrast, on slide 8, large and global Corporate Card spending, which
historically has been primarily for travel and entertainment, continued to show fewer signs of recovery. We have
said all along that we expect this will be the last customer type to see travel recover.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2021
Finally, putting all customer types' T&E spending together on slide 9, you do see improvement across the board in
the second quarter with total T&E spending reaching nearly 70% of 2019 levels in the month of June. As I said
earlier, this recovery has been faster than we expected led by a sharp recovery in US consumer T&E spending
which reached 98% of pre-pandemic levels in June and has continued to grow in July. Looking ahead, we now
assume that overall T&E spending globally will have recovered to around 80% of 2019 levels by the fourth quarter
of 2021. We also expect continued steady growth in goods and services spending for the remaining 2021. So all
in all, a really good story on spending volumes.
Moving to our other volume metric, receivable and loan balances on slide 10, you'll see a slightly different set of
charts here and in a few other places throughout this presentation where we thought it would be helpful to show
comparisons for the first and second quarter relative to both 2020 and 2019 to help you better [Technical
Difficulty] (00:17:32) the recovery. Loan balances began to slowly recover in the second quarter and were up 7%
sequentially and 4% year-over-year. Relative to 2019 though, loan balances remain down 11% more than
spending volumes. We continue to see the liquidity and strength amongst our customer base leading to higher
paydown rates, which is also driving the very strong credit performance I'll talk about in a moment. Looking
forward, I would expect the recovery in loan balances to continue to lag the recovery in spending volumes.
This leads then to the second key driver to watch this year, credit and provision on slides 11 through 14. As you
flip through these slides, there are a few key points I'd like you to take away. Most importantly, we continue to see
extremely strong credit performance with Card Member loans and receivables write-off and delinquency rates
remaining around historical lows, although we would expect loss rates to slowly return to more normal levels
eventually. Given how low delinquency rates are today, we don't expect to see a material increase in write-off
rates anytime this year. This strong credit performance, combined with some improvement in our macroeconomic
outlook drove a $606 million provision expense benefit in the second quarter as the low write-offs were fully offset
by the reserve release as shown on slide 12.
That said, the balances enrolled in our financial relief programs are still $1.1 billion higher than they were pre-
pandemic as you can see on slide 13. We are closely monitoring how the Card Members exiting our financial
relief programs are performing, and early performance of recent exits has looked quite strong. But we are mindful
that the last of the government stimulus and industry forbearance programs have yet to roll off and there are
remaining uncertainties in the medical and macroeconomic environment around the world, including in the US. So
we continue to hold a significant amount of reserves. As you see on slide 14, we ended the second quarter with
$4 billion of reserves, representing 5% of loan balances and 0.2% of our Card Member receivable balances
respectively.
Moving on to our third key driver, marketing investments to build long-term growth momentum on slide 15, we
invested $1.3 billion in marketing in the second quarter as we continue to ramp-up new card acquisitions while
maintaining some of our value injection efforts. We acquired 2.4 million new cards, up around 20% sequentially.
More importantly than just the total number of cards, we've seen great demand for our premium fee-based
products with new accounts acquired on these products up 30% versus the prior quarter and up almost four times
year-over-year. As Steve mentioned as some great examples, acquisitions of new US consumer and small
business Platinum and Gold cards all reached well above 2019 levels this quarter. Based on the momentum
we've seen in the first half of this year, we would now expect to see around $5 billion in marketing spend this year.
Ultimately though, our marketing levels will be governed by the universe of attractive investment opportunities we
see and the pace at which we finish winding down our value injection efforts in the remainder of the year.
So what does all this mean for revenues on slide 16? Total revenues were up 33% year-over-year in the second
quarter and we had double-digit growth in almost every one of our revenue lines except for net interest income
7

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2021
which only accounts for 18% of our revenues. Before I get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in
the next few slides, I would note that other fees and commissions and other revenue were both up sharply year-
over-year in the second quarter primarily driven by the uptick in travel-related revenues.
Our largest revenue line, discount revenue, led the recovery though as it was up 56% on an FX-adjusted basis
year-over-year as shown on slide 17. This recovery is primarily driven by the strong growth in goods and services
spending that we've seen over the past few quarters. Net card fee revenues grew 10% year-over-year in the
quarter. Importantly, these revenues have been our most resilient revenue line throughout the pandemic as you
can see on slide 18. They are now $300 million or 30% higher than they were back in the second quarter of 2019,
demonstrating the impact of the continued attractiveness of our premium value propositions to both prospects and
existing customers.
The one revenue line showing a slower recovery is net interest income on slide 19 which, as I mentioned,
accounts for only 18% of our revenues. For us though, the driver here is the strong liquidity demonstrated by our
customers which is leading to both our historically low credit costs and to higher paydown rates that are driving
lower net interest yields and a slower recovery in revolving loan balances. Looking ahead, I continue to expect the
recovery in net interest income to lag the recovery in loan volumes.
So to sum up on revenues, the momentum of our revenue recovery strengthened in Q2 as you can see on slide
20. While revenues remain 6% below pre-pandemic levels, on an FX-adjusted basis they were up 31% year-over-
year. Looking forward, with the momentum in goods and services spend growth we've seen in the first half of the
year and our updated assumption that we now expect overall T&E to recover to 80% of 2019 levels by the fourth
quarter of the year, full year revenue growth could be around 12% to 14%, assuming current trends continue.
Moving on to expenses, we're continuing to break out on slide 21 our variable customer engagement expenses
which move with spend volumes and benefits usage and marketing and OpEx which are driven by management
decisions. Variable customer engagement expenses in total were up 85% year-over-year driven by higher
spending and usage of travel-related benefits. Looking forward, a good way to think about these variable
customer engagement expenses is that I'd expect them to be about 40% of our total revenues for the remainder
of the year. Moving on to operating expenses, you can see that they were down 1% year-over-year in the second
quarter primarily driven by a few sizable gains in our Amex Ventures equity investment portfolio. In 2021 full year,
given the year-to-date gains we've seen in our equity investment portfolio, I'd now expect our full year OpEx to be
a bit below the $11.5 billion we originally expected as we continue to keep tight control over our operating
expenses while also investing to build growth momentum in our business.
Turning next to capital on slide 22, our capital position remains tremendously strong. Our Q2 CET1 ratio of 14.2%
remains far above our target levels driven by the shrinkage in our balance sheet over the past year and growth in
our capital base from earnings that have exceeded distributions. We returned $1.3 billion in total to shareholders
this quarter, including common stock repurchases of $908 million and $346 million in common stock dividends.
Looking forward, we remain committed to our long-term CET1 target ratio of 10% to 11%. Given the Federal
Reserve's latest guidance, we plan to increase the pace of share repurchases to migrate towards our CET1 ratio
target over the next few quarters.
So let's close by talking about what the signs of momentum we saw in the first half of the year might mean for the
future. In January and again in April, I laid out two scenarios of potential outcomes for 2021 that were primarily
based on what happens with credit reserves. As a reminder, our scenario one, or low scenario, assumed a much
worse medical and economic environment this year and that we would not release any credit reserves in the
subsequent quarters. Now halfway into the year, the macro outlook has improved somewhat and our actual credit

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2021
performance has remained incredibly strong, so we've already released $1.9 billion of reserves. That still leaves
us, however, with a reserve ratio that is above pre-pandemic levels due to the remaining uncertainties.
So our updated scenario one on slide 23 assumes that this uncertainty persists, that the medical environment and
economic outlook worsens and that we therefore don't release any additional credit reserves this year. Such an
economic outcome would likely put some pressure on our current assumption of an 80% overall T&E recovery by
Q4 and likely drive a somewhat weaker revenue recovery. The combination of these things could lead to an EPS
outcome as low as around $7.50 per share. Our updated scenario two, in contrast, assumes that we continue to
see strong credit performance and a steady improvement in the economic outlook, leading to less uncertainty
and, in all likelihood, a lower level of credit reserves. This sort of economic outcome would also likely drive a
somewhat stronger revenue recovery in line with the 12% to 14% revenue growth assumption I spoke about
earlier. In this scenario, our 2021 EPS could be as high as around $8.75.
More important though than these 2021 numbers is our focus on managing the company to further build growth
momentum. Our progress this quarter around our key drivers, volumes, credit performance, and marketing, was
very strong, and this gives us confidence that our strategies are working. Based on all these current trends, we
are confident in our ability in 2022 to be within the high end of the range of EPS expectations we originally had
before the pandemic for 2020 of $8.85 to $9.25, and we are confident in our ability to resume our financial growth
algorithm beyond 2022.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Vivian.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani, KBW. Please
go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. Obviously very strong spending growth. I guess when we look inside the billed business
growth, how much of that strength is coming from pent-up demand versus some of the new account growth? I'm
just curious, just trying to figure out how long this can last, obviously knowing that T&E volume is still on the
come. And just a quick clarification, Jeff, on the value injections. Should we assume that as T&E comes back,
those value injections slow? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Maybe I'll start, Steve, just because your last part of your question is quick, Sanjay, and then you can talk, Steve,
about the broader pent-up demand trends. On value injection, Sanjay, certainly with what we're seeing in the
world now, we would expect that to continue to go down each quarter and be completely gone by the end of the
year. And so that's one of the reasons as you think about 2022 our overall marketing line dollars should be down
a little bit in 2022 from 2021 because value injection will be at zero. Steve, you probably want to talk a little bit
about the demand issues.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. So Sanjay, I think it's a really good question. And if you look at it, we didn't acquire anywhere near the
amount of cards that we normally acquire last year. And if you look at this year, we're still ramping up and we're
still not at overall levels of acquisition that we'd want to be at. And the reason for that is you've got international
which has not opened up, and so acquisition levels from an international perspective, both from an SME side of it,
from a consumer side of it is not there. You've got Corporate Card acquisition; not a lot of companies are adding a
lot of people and so you don't have that. So when you really start to dig into this, a lot of this is really the pent-up
demand. And so just take a look at what we're looking at, and we look at Hilton co-brand cards and we look at
Delta co-brand cards, we continue to see them sequentially month-over-month add more volume. And what you're
now seeing is you're seeing volume being added in T&E but you are seeing sustained volume growth in goods
and services. And so we think we've done a really good job with the value injection in pivoting sort of people how
they thought about these cards.
And so looking back years from now, we may find that one of the sort of – the bright spots of this for us from a
spending perspective is people found other ways to use their cards and we actually improved our goods and
services mix. So I think you're seeing that pent-up demand coming from existing cardholders and yet we're not
back to travel levels in any way, shape or form. The other thing if you start to sort of dig into our spending by sort
of age group, we mentioned that our millennial spending is up 30% over 2019. Well, then you can just take that
and you go to the boomers and you go to our next level of people and that spending is still building up. So we
believe there's still a lot of spending within our existing base. You look at corporate spending which is about half
of what it was. Small business, while doing very well from a goods and services perspective is still challenged
from a T&E perspective.

And so we believe that a lot of the growth that we've had has come from the existing base and I think there's more
to come from that existing base. And as we get more and more Card Members onboard, you're going to see more
spending there as well. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Morning. Thanks for taking my question. I did want to dig in a little bit on the commentary around the marketing
spend and the value injection that you just indicated. On slide 15, you go through and indicate the degree of value
injection quarter-by-quarter, and just wanted to understand how you think about that value injection and how that
has impacted the retention as well as the acquisition with the question as you move into next year, do you think
that acquisition and retention rate will be able to remain at levels that you're seeing this year even without that
value injection? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
So the short answer is yes, but you probably want a little more color than that.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks, yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
So if you think about – let's go back to why. So why did we do the value injection? So we did the value injection to
make sure that the value propositions that were challenged at the time, which were predominantly travel-based
value propositions would – people wouldn't look at it and say I'm not getting value from the card. And that was – I
think we'll look back on that as a very important decision because what it said to our customers is that look, we
know that you are – you bought the product for a specific reason. You cannot use that product to – we always talk
about experiences and access, and you can't get that. And so what we did was, and I give our teams, our
marketing teams a tremendous amount of credit here is we look for categories that people were going to really
double-down on – in streaming services, wireless services, more shipping services, even dining on some of our
co-brand cards, and we invested a lot of money in value injection.
The other thing that we did is we also at the top end, on our Platinum and our Centurion is put credits in for travel,
okay? Which is one of the reasons I think our TLS bookings are now above 2019 levels in June. And we
continued that at the beginning of the year because the beginning of the year, we were still unsure but we
changed the value injection. So on Platinum Card we went to a PayPal credit, and that PayPal credit was to get
more embedding within that ecosystem so that you have more cards on file. But our plan has been, and always
has been is that the value that we have in our products stands on its own. And once we got to the point where
people could take advantage of the existing product, and this is predominantly more of a US phenomenon at this
particular point in time, you didn't need that value injection.
And so then we get back to okay, what did we learn? And then you look at the Platinum refresh. And if you look at
the Platinum refresh, what does that have? Well, it has a wider variety of components to it. In terms of streaming,

it has digital credits, whether it's Sirius or Peacock or New York Times or what have you, and it also has another
travel credit within there. And so we don't believe we need to rely on value injection at all. And so as you look at
the high marketing going forward, we believe the value of the products will stand for themselves. Having said that,
we're also going to go back on our quest to continue to refresh our product portfolio. And you're seeing that – you
obviously just saw that with the Platinum Card. And we're not going to stop at the Platinum Card, but I'll stop at
that comment at this point.
And so when you look at the $5 billion in spending, what we made the decision this year is we weren't going to
cap that spending. So at the beginning of the year, you're seeing a lot of value injection, but we also made the
decision at the beginning of the year to go in with more customer acquisition. And so we'll continue to do that
which will drive us closer to the $5 billion. But the bottom line on this is that our products were resilient through
this. We propped them up a little bit. We learned a lot, and what we're seeing with our consumers right now is that
they are utilizing these value propositions. And they're utilizing these value propositions with lounge visits, with
bookings, by using the travel credits and all the benefits that come with Gold and Platinum. We talk a lot about
Platinum, but the Gold Card, too, is another premium product that we have. And that has been positioned a lot
more as a dining product, and that has taken off as restaurants, especially in the United States, have come back.
So the short answer I guess is that we don't believe we need value injection anymore. We believe the value in the
products will continue to sustain the spending.

David Mark Togut Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Thank you. Good morning. What is your expected timeline and trajectory of the international T&E billings
recovery? And as a related question on international, when will domestic China American Express become
material to overall revenue and earnings?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
All right. So the first one, if anybody on the call can tell me, that would be good because I don't know. I think
you've got a situation in Europe. Look at Japan with the Olympics, right? I mean, everybody is expecting
spectators to be there; there's no spectators there. You've got Australia which is still closed. You've got the UK
which is battling the Delta variant, and so I don't know what's going to happen with international. Having said that,
our billings continue to improve in international. People, much like they were in the US, are looking for ways to
travel, whether that be car trips, whether that be more restaurant and so forth. And so I don't really expect
international to come back this year, and hopefully at some point next year, but that's really all going to be driven
by vaccination and the efficacy of vaccinations. And remember, the vaccines that are available in other countries
are not the same vaccines that are available in the United States. And there's different efficacy on all different
types of vaccines, whether that's AstraZeneca which has like a 67% efficacy or it's a Moderna or a Pfizer which is
up at 88%. And so what you're seeing in the UK now is vaccinated people actually get COVID, not being
hospitalized or dying but still getting COVID. So I don't think we're going to see international come back this year,
I think, and it's not really – we look at it as a tailwind for sort of 2022 and 2023 for us.
As far as China goes, look, China is – we're really pleased with what's going on in China. And part of the China
story is continuing to build the network and continuing to build the card base, and we continue month-over-month
to build that network and to build that card base. And as we move into other quarters, we'll provide more insight

into what's going on. But I'm not – I wouldn't say you can expect China to be a material part of our revenue base
or our earnings base in the near-term future; more medium to long-term. But I'd also like to remind everybody of
the model that we have in China. The model that we have in China is a network-based model. And the way to
think about a network-based model is to think about that model much like Visa and Mastercard's normal model is.
We're not taking card fees, we're not getting a discount rate. We're getting network fees, and that's the way that's
working. But we are building China. We believe it'll add more scale not only for us and more presence in China for
both our Card Members that travel there, but it'll also add scale for us as Chinese Card Members travel outside of
China and add more scale and add more volume to the overall network. So China will not be material in the near-
term.

Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Steve, I would just emphasize one point back on the international spending which is it is important to go back to
slide 5 of the deck and realize that outside the US, spending on goods and services actually has recovered just as
strongly as it has in the US, and we expect that will continue. The other thing to remember is that as we express
our confidence in our ability to get to our 2022 financial objectives, we're really not counting on international T&E
coming back in any meaningful way next year. We are confident it will at some point, and whenever it does, that'll
be a tailwind. But it's not a key element of our confidence about 2022. So next question, operator?

Hey, Ryan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
So I maybe just wanted to flesh out the 2022 expectations a little bit further. So Jeff, you talked about 12% to 14%
revenue growth this year. I think that would put you back at 2019 levels. So can you maybe explain to us what's
incorporated for the high end in terms of spend and top line? Are you assuming that G&S could continue to run
elevated or are you assuming some sort of a hand-off to T&E given all the pent-up demand? And secondly, Jeff,
can you maybe just clarify the capital comments, how quickly can you get back to 10% to 11%? It seems like
there could be a pretty big buyback over the next few quarters. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, maybe we'll work backwards, Steve, because I think the capital one is simpler than the first one. On capital,
Ryan, you should – as I said in my remarks, look, we're going to increase the pace of our share repurchases and
we will get back within our CET1 target range of 10% to 11% over the next few quarters. In many ways, the
governor on that is as we increase the size of our share repurchases, we want to be mindful of overall volumes in
the market and we're not trying to do anything that is, in the near-term, going to drive the stock price. So we'll get
there in the next few quarters. Exactly when will be a little bit of a function of what kind of volumes and trading we

see in the overall market. But we're committed to being in that 10% to 11% range, and that means we got a lot of
capital to return to shareholders.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
So as we think about next year and now, look, we went from comments of our aspiration was to be in the range to
comments today of our anticipation is we'll be at the high end of the range. So what's driving that? The first thing I
want to sort of clearly state is given that the recovery is uneven, we will continue to invest as we've been
investing. And I think we have pulled back in our international card investment right now because it just doesn't
make a lot of sense to continue to double-down on that. And so we will continue as we move into next year to
invest in not only our US card acquisition but international card acquisition, both small business and premium
products.
What are the assumptions behind sort of next year's getting to that high end? Well, look, we need consumer T&E
to fully recover in 2022, and it's on a path to do that. So that is, I think, good. Obviously, we'd like a reasonably
healthy economy as well. And so all things being equal, things continue the way they are in the US, we feel really
confident. What's not in those financial objectives is the following. A full recovery of net interest income, and you
can look at our revenue and you see where we are from a net interest income perspective. Corporate T&E is not
factored in there, which we don't believe that'll come back until 2023. Cross-border T&E we believe will continue
to be challenged. And the comments that Jeff just made about international, while goods and services we think
will continue to grow, I think consumer T&E and corporate T&E in international will continue to be challenged. So
if that comes back, obviously that provides upside and they would be tailwinds for 2022, but we would more be
counting on those as tailwinds for 2023. But again, it's really hard to predict, but that's a positive for us.
The one thing I will have people keep in mind though is that we've had some big reserve releases. And as Jeff
mentioned when we talked about sort of $7.50 to $8.75, the $8.75 would anticipate some more releases which
would mean even bigger reserve releases, and so you have to grow over that. And part of those reserve releases
is the extraordinary billed that we did last year. But I'd like to point out the other part of those reserve releases is
the extraordinary job our credit team is doing, and so that's the other piece of it that we take into account. All that
being said, we feel really good about how we're tracking for this year, and that's why we feel good about saying
the high end of the range for 2022. And I just gave you a bunch of upside possibilities and I just gave you the
grow-over possibility as well with the, also, notion is we're not going to get – we're not going to cut marketing to
get there. We're not going to be at $5 billion because we will not have value injection there, but we will continue to
invest in marketing because I think it has proven for us to be a great source of revenue growth.

Christopher Donat Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, gentlemen. I had one question about net card fees, Jeff. When I look pre-pandemic, they've been
growing – and this is slide 18 – growing around 20%, and then with the pandemic and the lower issues going on
there, growth decelerated for the net card fees. As we think about the remainder of 2021 and 2022 and what
you've got going on with retention and the value injections, and it sounds like a ton of good things going on, on the
acquisition side, should we expect an acceleration in net card fee growth over coming quarters?

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2021
So Chris, as I said in my remarks, we feel really good about the net card fee growth. In fact, I like to point out that
the dollars that we have grown net card fees by, more than $300 million a quarter since 2019 interestingly kind of
offsets the drop in net interest income, and we have a lot further to go. All that said, as most of you know, the
accounting for card fees is a little complicated because we amortize people's card fee payments over 12 months
after they pay them, and so that causes the trends to move slowly. So I've said through much of this year that I
expected card fee growth, because we weren't acquiring a lot of new Card Members last year, to slow quite
significantly in the back half of the year.
And I will tell you now that with the tremendous progress on bringing new fee-paying Card Members into the
franchise, I think you might see a little bit of slowing in the next couple quarters before it re-accelerates next year.
But boy, it's a lot less than we originally anticipated. The other thing I would remind people of is it's really bringing
new fee-paying Card Members into the franchise that drives net card fee growth. And in fact, when you think,
Steve, about the Platinum refresh that you talked about, well, we raised the fee for existing Card Members. That
fee actually doesn't hit until their anniversary date next year. And then once it hits, we'll amortize it over 12
months. So it's a lovely, long tailwind, but it's not going to be the driver of the next couple of quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Right. And the only other point I'd make is if you look at that net card fees, the absolute dollars continue to grow.
And so – and that's a direct result of the retention efforts.

Operator: And the next question is from the line of Moshe Orenbuch, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Thanks. And wanted to kind of talk a little bit about the 40% of variable customer engagement costs and how to
think about that in the coming years. One of the things that you've obviously had tremendous success, and you
alluded to them in the kind of prepared remarks in terms of the spending on the co-brand cards, but some of
those contracts have kind of both volume levels and accelerators. If I recall, the Delta co-brand was supposed to
accelerate to 2023 in terms of the payments. Could you talk a little bit about that, your views on that 40%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, a couple comments, Moshe. First, because of the effects of the pandemic, the variable customer
engagement costs sort of have been flowing with revenues. But if you go back a year, you had our Card Members
suddenly not redeeming travel-related benefits, not traveling around, and that caused some unusual declines.
Boy, the good news now is they're back traveling, and that recovery means that now we're back incurring some of
those costs, and that makes the year-over-year, when you look at it just for the quarter, look a little unusual.
That's why for simplicity purposes we've said, look, we're running at about 40% of total revenues. I'd expect that
to be the case for the next few quarters. Next year, we'll have to see how all parts of the business are performing.
I guess if I step back from all the math though, I would just say it's a very good thing to see our members back
engaged with our travel-related benefits. We feel really good about the value propositions we have in the
marketplace given the kind of acquisition and retention numbers Steve talked about. And it's those Card Member
engagement costs that drive that tremendous attachment for our existing customers and the ability to attract new
customers. So I think the 40% is a good number for the next few quarters, and we'll have to see where it ends up
next year and we'll give you an update.

Lisa Ellis Q
Analyst, MoffettNathanson LLC
Hi. Thanks. I had a question about retention. You've been highlighting the strength in retention throughout the
pandemic. And just taking a peek at the supplementals, it looks like you're up 2.1 million in cards-in-force on 2.4
million in cards acquired, so that is in fact very good retention. Can you just talk a bit about what's been driving
that and whether or not you think it will persist after the pandemic? And so can we expect sustained growth in
cards-in-force going forward? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Well, look, I think as I said, I think some of the decisions that we made around value injection, some of the
decisions we made around providing relief – but I will tell you, I think the largest thing that drove retention at the
beginning of this pandemic were not a lot of companies were answering the phone, and our customer satisfaction
scores from a servicing perspective really went through the roof for us during the pandemic. We pivoted people to
home very, very quickly. We had equipment at the ready for them and they felt safe, they felt secure, and they
were able to take care of our customers. And so at that time people called American Express, we were there to
help them. And if you think about the help that we provided to people, it was I'm not taking – I can't take my trip,
I'm canceled, I had tickets to this, I had to – whatever it might have been, and we were able to help.
And when you help somebody one time, that's a lifetime savior because they'll always remember it. And the
reality is I think it was the combination of outstanding customer service because more people needed customer
service during this pandemic than they ever did before, especially with cancellations of events, and I think we
stood out. I think we stood out among everybody else once again, and I think the value injection and the financial
relief programs. And we have continually looked to engage with our customers throughout the pandemic and
meet their needs. So our hope is, and we're seeing it persist right now is that we'll continue to retain these
customers and build their loyalty. But I would not downplay customer service's role in this retention. I can't tell you
how many emails and letters I got that people were calling out to say look, I was on hold with somebody for five
hours and I went to you and you guys were able to handle it; you answered the call in four, five minutes. So I think
that really helped a lot, Lisa. I really do.

Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey. Thanks for taking my question this morning. I'm curious when you think about the 80% recovery of T&E in
the fourth quarter, how important corporate travel is to that recovery? And the reason that I raise that is I think
there's an important distinction between leisure travel which has a long planning cycle and business travel which
tends to have a much shorter planning cycle, and I'm assuming that that short planning cycle creates volatility in
terms of your expectations. And I'm curious how much upside/downside there is associated with that corporate
travel.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2021
Yeah. I would say very little downside because we're assuming – we're not assuming very much, and we're just
using ourselves as an example. There are a lot of companies that are still not even back yet, right? And it's hard
to travel when you're not back and it's hard to travel when there's nobody to travel to. I think New York is a little bit
different phenomenon in the financial services here, but the reality is, is we're not assuming very much from a
corporate travel perspective, minimal improvement from really where we are. So the downside volatility, I think, is
negligible; the upside is pretty positive. But again, we're not anticipating a lot of travel.
Having said that, corporate travel will come back. Anybody that believes that Zoom, Webex or Google Meets or
Microsoft Teams or what have you is going to take the place of face-to-face is crazy; it's not. I think it's a great
supplement, but ultimately people will get back. But people are still antsy about getting out there, but not so much
for consumer travel. They're pretty willing to get out for consumer travel but they are a little bit – again, I think for
corporate travel it's a different thing. But the reality is it will come back and I think there's nothing like face-to-face
interaction and doing business that way. And so – but I see it more as upside, Rick, and not a volatile downside.
Now having said that, if it does come back and then goes down, that's when the volatility comes in. But I think
behavior, once it shifts back to corporate travel I believe will stay there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
And Rick, the only numbers I'd add to that is yes, we expect Q4 to be at about 80% overall, led by consumer
though to Steve's point. So I'd expect Global Consumer to be at 95% probably of 2019 levels, US Consumer at or
above 2019 levels. And of course, the other thing, Steve, that's interesting is small businesses, even now, are
traveling more than the large businesses.

Yeah. Thanks. Just a quick clarification and then a bigger-picture question. On the higher end guidance for 2021,
does that contemplate reserve releases that gets you down around kind of the CECL day one level? And then
kind of big-picture for Steve, what's your experience been historically on the impact of wealth effects on spend
because obviously, if you look at since the beginning of last year, there have been some pretty significant wealth
effects for a lot of your cardholders? And what implications that may have for kind of where spend levels can
recover to once your customers don't have the same restrictions on their activities?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. So wealth, I've said this many times. Consumers like to consume, and so giving opportunities to consume,
they will start consuming. And I've been here a long time and I remember after 9/11, people sort of didn't travel

and sort of hoarded a little bit and then all of a sudden, it exploded. And if you look back historically, you saw
tremendous growth for us after 9/11. And it wasn't in travel; I mean, people started to spend on their homes,
spend on other lifestyle choices and things like that, and eventually travel came back. And so I think the wealth –
if you look at the savings that has accumulated within the United States and the wealth that has accumulated from
stock appreciation and what have you, I think that only bodes well for us for people to continue to spend. And so I
would anticipate – and again, we saw this right after 9/11 and we saw this after the financial crisis as well, just
tells you I've been around a long time, and I think that will actually happen. But we've never seen, I haven't seen
wealth accumulation like this across the continuum when you look at the overall savings rate. And then just look
at where the stock market is, obviously at an all-time high. So I think that really bodes – that bodes well for us as
we think about spending going forward, and that's why we're bullish on 2022 and beyond.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
And on the credit reserves, Mark, I'd point out on slide 14, in dollar terms we are actually already below the dollar
reserves that we had day one of CECL, $4 billion now versus $4.3 billion. What's still above, however, day one is
the percent of the actual loans outstanding that the reserves represent. If you think about that $8.75 scenario,
certainly I would anticipate that that includes some reserve releases that bring that percentage below the day one
CECL percentage. The unknowable question at this point is how far below. But when you think about the credit
metrics right now, it would suggest that your reserve levels, once all the various kinds of uncertainty work
themselves through, it would suggest that your reserves as a percentage of loans outstanding should be
significantly lower.

Your lend-centric competitors have been very focused on elevated payment rates. Is Amex at all focused on
stepping in to capture a greater share of balance growth as payment rates normalize? I know capturing your fair
share of balances that Amex customers carry with competitors was a big focus pre-pandemic, but would
appreciate any color on whether this is an opportunity that you're actively looking to pursue now.

Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Well, I think obviously during the pandemic that obviously slowed down, but we're back at it. And the reality is we
can be back at it, but if they're not going to revolve balances it really doesn't matter. But we have opened up again
obviously. We tightened up – just to remind everybody, we tightened up our credit controls pre-pandemic, and
that allowed us to go in pretty quickly and I think do a lot of really good things for our customers and for ourselves.
But we've opened it up this year and we're out there looking to acquire balances. We're not going to do crazy

stuff, but we're looking at acquiring balances where it makes sense. And when I mean acquiring balances, I'm not
talking about zero interest rate things like that. What I'm talking about is engaging with our customers to see what
their revolve needs are and to see if we can meet those needs, whether it be through a pay it, plan it or whether it
be through a consumer personal loan or whether it just be through a normal card revolve product. So that's how
we're thinking about it.

Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Steve, could you provide an update on the Amazon small business co-brand partnership and also whether it
would make sense to look at the consumer co-brand if that were to come to market? It seems like a deal you don't
necessarily need, but maybe it makes sense in some areas.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Well, look, here's what I would say. We're really happy with our overall Amazon relationship, and that is a multi-
faceted relationship. Not only do we buy Amazon services from them, but small business I think has been a good
thing for both of us. I think it's been good for our customers. I think we've been able to offer some great value. A
lot of our customers use it as a companion product, and so that's worked. I think our pay with points efforts with
Amazon has really worked. And what I would say about co-brand opportunities, look, we look at them all that
makes sense, and we look at – predominantly, we've had a lot of travel co-brands obviously. We've also had
other co-brands, and people who remember the Costco co-brand but we've also had a Lowe's co-brand for small
business. Obviously, we have the Amazon co-brand for small business as well, and not just in the United States
but in a couple of other markets.
And we look at the opportunities, and what we do is we look at those opportunities and can we provide a value
proposition that makes sense to our customers and can we do that in an economical way? And an economical
way may not just be the economics of the co-brand deal itself. It may also be the economics of what a co-brand
could do to the overall portfolio, both positively and negatively. And so there's a lot of things you look at when you
evaluate a co-brand, and we'll do what's right for our customers and our shareholders.

Robert Napoli Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Good morning, Steve and Jeff. A question on the – related I guess to the SMB market itself and the competitive
environment. You've seen new players coming into that market, whether it's somebody like Square or there are a
number of fintechs that are doing charge cards with spend management attached to it. Maybe just some thoughts
on the importance of the growth of SMB, what you're doing and how you view any change in the competitive
environment and what new value injections that, maybe not in that term but products or services you're looking to
add in maybe US and international.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2021
Yeah. Well, I think let me just – I'll just mention international. International right now, certainly different competitive
environment internationally than in the United States. There's not one competitor; it's competitors by market. But I
would say at the moment, not a hotbed of activity. Small businesses, the viability of a number of small businesses
in international markets, not a lot of people have line of sight into those right now and we're not growing anywhere
near like we used to grow. If you remember small business international, high double digits, high double-digit
teens for two, three years in a row. And so – and we think we can get back to that; we just don't – we don't see
that happening this year and we're not counting on it for next year. But internationally, you're competing with local
banks and so forth. And again, we've done Amazon deals in multiple countries and I think that has helped, and we
continue to look for partnerships where they make sense.
In the United States, we continue to grow. In fact, June was one of our best acquisition months in the history of
our Small Business Card in the United States, so we're really pleased with that. There is a lot of competition.
There's a lot of fintechs. There are banks out there. Capital One is aggressive, US Bank is aggressive, JP –
everybody is aggressive in this space. And ultimately, it comes down to value. And we continue to grow. And
again here, from a small business perspective, I think we did a nice job with value injection. I think you will see us
continue our strategy of product refreshes over the coming year. But I think one of the big things that we've done
obviously is the Kabbage acquisition. And just last month, we launched the Kabbage checking account, the
working capital, cash flow analysis and so forth. And what you'll see ultimately is that Kabbage platform being the
landing point for our small businesses. And the way you want to think about this is, is fintech with scale. And so
when you think about Kabbage, which is a pure-play fintech in the small business space, and you think about
American Express and the small businesses and you combine that together, you have a fintech at scale. Not a
fintech growing at scale; a fintech growing from scale, from scale with a balance sheet.
And so that has always been the vision of Kabbage. We've made – as you bring Kabbage into the bank holding
company structure, you have to do some other things to future-proof it, if you will, and that's what we've been
doing. But that's what you will see. Ultimately, what you will see is a fintech with a traditional bank scale and a
very strong balance sheet, and we'll continue to add products as we move along onto that platform. And that was
the vision, right? I mean, we see a lot of other people out there doing those kinds of things. But to be able to do
that at scale from the get-go I think is a big win for us. So that's the vision in the medium-term here for Kabbage,
and we just launched that platform from an Amex perspective just last month with those other products on it.

Operator: And our final question will come from the line of Craig Maurer, Autonomous Research. Please go
ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig Maurer Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking the questions and squeezing me in. I really wanted to ask about the competitive
environment in high-end US consumer, considering we just saw Citi shut down their Platinum competitor going
forward. Has the US premium consumer race really just boiled down now to two competitors, Amex and Chase?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. So I don't know. That's the best way to answer it. Look, I don't know what Citi's strategy is. I don't know if
it's just a pullback for now to a re-entry. That's a possibility. I know Wells is looking to get stronger in this space.
And so what we really focus in on, Craig, is – we focus in on is developing the best product possible and to make
sure we can take on all-comers. And some may say in the middle of the pandemic you're relaunching your

Platinum Card and you're raising the fee. Yeah, we are. Why? Because that was part of the strategy. We learned
a lot during the pandemic as well. We were able to enhance the product. When you look at it, we added $1,400
worth of additional value for $140 worth of additional cost. And as a great example of leveraging our partnerships,
leveraging our know-how, leveraging the digital assets that we have whether that be Resy or LoungeBuddy or
what have you within that overall collection. And so yeah, maybe it might look like right now it's Chase and
American Express, and Chase is a very formidable competitor with very smart people who are working really hard
to beat us and we're working really hard to beat them.
But I'm not assuming it's going to be just us and Chase for long. I think you will see other people I think try and get
in this game. And our Platinum refresh is another shot across the bow at anybody that really wants to come in and
play in this game. We're ready and we'll continue to up our game and up our service and provide even more and
more value to our Card Members. And look, as I said in my remarks, the Platinum refresh last time worked and
that was in the face of JPMorgan Chase entering in with a strong product, and we believe it's going to work this
time. And early results, and obviously we're only in for three weeks here. But if you just do the value calculation, it
is a really strong product and we're really proud of what we've put out in the marketplace.
