Chief Financial Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on slide 3 of tonight's presentation. In the second quarter,
Capital One earned $3.5 billion or $7.62 per diluted common share. Included in the results for the quarter was a
$55 million legal reserve build. Net of this adjusting item, earnings per share in the quarter was $7.71.
On a GAAP basis, pre-provision earnings increased slightly in the sequential quarter to $3.4 billion. We recorded
a provision benefit of $1.2 billion in the quarter as $541 million of charge-off was offset by a $1.7 billion allowance
release.
Revenue grew 4% in the linked quarter, largely driven by the impact of strong domestic card purchase volume on
non-interest income and the absence of the mark on our Snowflake investment a quarter ago.
Period-end loans held for investment grew $6.5 billion or 3% inclusive of the effect of moving $4.1 billion of loans
to held for sale during the quarter. The loans moved to held for sale consisted of $2.6 billion of an international
card partnership portfolio and $1.5 billion in commercial loans.
Turning to slide 4, I will cover the changes in our allowance in the quarter. We released $1.7 billion of allowance,
primarily driven by observed strong credit performance and an improved economic outlook.
Turning to slide 5, we provide the allowance coverage ratios by segment. You can see allowance coverage
declined in the quarter across all segments, largely reflecting the dynamics I just described. However, coverage
ratios remain well above pre-pandemic levels due to continued economic uncertainty as our allowance is built to
absorb a wide range of outcomes.
Our domestic card coverage is now 8.9%, down from 10.5% last quarter. Our branded card coverage is 10.1%.
Recall that the difference between branded and domestic coverage is largely driven by the loss-sharing
agreements in some of our partnership portfolios.
Coverage in our Consumer business declined about 60 basis points to 3.0%. In addition to continued strong credit
performance and improved economic outlook, historically high auto values aided the reduction in coverage.
Coverage in our Commercial Banking business declined about 25 basis points to 1.7% with the single largest
driver being the improvement in our energy portfolio.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
Turning to page 6, I'll now discuss liquidity. You can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during
the quarter was 141%. The LCR continues to be well above the 100% regulatory requirement. Our liquidity
reserves from cash, securities and Federal Home Loan Bank capacity ended the quarter at approximately $137
billion. The $14 billion decline in total liquidity was driven by lower ending cash balances. Our cash position
declined in the quarter as it was redeployed to net loan growth, wholesale funding maturities, a modest increase
in our securities portfolio and share repurchases.
Moving to page 7, I'll now discuss net interest margin. You can see that our second quarter net interest margin
was 5.89%, 10 basis points lower than the prior quarter. The linked quarter decline in NIM was largely driven by
lower yield in our card portfolio, where the typical seasonal decrease in revolve rate was exacerbated by higher
transactor volume and associated higher payments. These impacts were partially offset by the favorable impact
from one more day in the quarter.
Lastly, turning to slide 8, I will cover our capital position. Our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.5% at the
end of the second quarter, down 10 basis points from the first quarter. Loan growth and capital actions were
largely offset by earnings growth. During the quarter, the Federal Reserve released the results of their stress test.
Our stress capital buffer requirement, which will be effective on October 1 of this year, is 2.5% resulting in a total
capital requirement by the Fed of 7.0%.
While we saw a decline in this year's SCB, it's important to note that the Fed's stress testing results can move
around meaningfully from year to year and are only one of many factors that we use in our capital planning
process. Based on our internal modeling, we continue to estimate that our CET1 capital need is around 11%.
Turning to share repurchases, we repurchased $1.7 billion of common stock in the second quarter, the full
amount allowed under the Fed's capital preservation measures. We have approximately $5.3 billion remaining of
our current board authorization of $7.5 billion.
Now let me move on to dividends. In the third quarter of 2020, we reduced our dividend to $0.10 due to the Fed's
capital preservation measures. We chose to continue this reduced level of dividend in the fourth quarter of 2020
out of an abundance of caution.
The difference between our historical $0.40 dividend and the reduced level for those two quarters was $0.60 per
common share. Therefore, we expect to make up for the reduced level of dividends from the second half of 2020
by paying a $0.60 special dividend in the third quarter of 2021.
In addition to the special dividend, we expect to increase our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.40 per
share to $0.60 per share in the third quarter. Both the $0.60 special dividend and the increase of our quarterly
common stock dividend to $0.60 will be subject to board approval.
With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Rich?

Thanks, Andrew, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin on slide 10 with our Credit Card business. Strong year-
over-year purchase volume growth drove an increase in revenue compared to the second quarter of 2020, more
than offsetting a modest year-over-year decline in loan balances. And provision for credit losses improved
significantly.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
Credit Card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends which are shown on
slide 11. Second quarter results reflect building momentum in our domestic card business. As we emerge from
the pandemic, consumers are spending more and continuing to make elevated payments.
Accelerating purchase volume growth partially offset the impact of historically high payment rates, resulting in
strong revenue growth and a more modest year-over-year decline in loan balances. High payment rates are
continuing to contribute to strikingly strong credit results.
Domestic card purchase volume for the second quarter was up 48% from the second quarter of 2020. Purchase
volume was up 25% from the second quarter of 2019, which is an acceleration from the first quarter when we saw
growth of 17% versus 2019.
T&E spending continues to catch up to overall spending and accelerated through the second quarter. In June,
T&E purchase volume was up 3% compared to June of 2019. At the end of the quarter, domestic card loan
balances were down $4.1 billion or about 4% year-over-year.
Excluding the impact of a partnership portfolio moved to held for sale last year, second quarter ending loans
declined about 2% year-over-year. Compared to the sequential quarter, ending loans were up about 5%, ahead of
typical seasonal growth of 2%.
Credit performance remained strikingly strong. The domestic card charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.28%, a
225 basis point improvement year-over-year. The 30-plus delinquency rate at quarter end was 1.68%, 106 basis
points better than the prior year. Provision for credit losses improved by about $3.5 billion year-over-year. We
swung from a large allowance build in the second quarter last year to a large allowance release this year.
Let me turn to domestic card revenue margin. Purchase volume growth outpacing loan growth and strong credit
were the key drivers of domestic card revenue margin, which was up 226 basis points year-over-year to 17.7%.
Revenue margin increased over 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter, higher than our typical seasonal pattern.
Total company marketing expense was $620 million in the quarter, up $347 million compared to the second
quarter of 2020. Our choices in card marketing are the biggest driver of total company marketing trends.
As we emerge from the pandemic, we're seeing strong originations and purchase volumes. Our growth
opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation. We are leaning further into marketing to drive future
growth and continue to build our franchise. At the same time, we're keeping a watchful eye on the competitive
environment which is intensifying. Pulling up, our domestic card business continues to deliver significant value
and build momentum.
Slide 12 summarizes second quarter results for our Consumer Banking business. Auto growth and exceptional
auto credit are the main themes in second quarter Consumer Banking results. Driven by auto, second quarter
ending loans increased 12% year-over-year in the Consumer Banking business.
Average loans also grew 12%. Auto originations were up 56% year-over-year and up 47% from the linked quarter.
Pent-up demand and high auto prices drove a second quarter surge in growth across the auto marketplace. In the
context of increased industry growth, our digital capabilities and deep dealer relationship strategy continued to
drive strong growth in our auto business.
Second quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up $4.4 billion or 2% year-over-year. Average
deposits were up 9% year-over-year. Consumer Banking revenue increased 27% from the prior year quarter,

driven by growth in auto loans and retail deposits. Second quarter provision for credit losses improved by $1.2
billion year-over-year, driven by an allowance release and lower charge-offs in our auto business.
Credit results in our auto business are strikingly strong. Year-over-year, the second quarter charge-off rate
improved 120 basis points to negative 0.12% and the delinquency rate was essentially flat at 3.26%. In the
quarter, elevated used car prices drove an increase in auction proceeds amplifying the normal seasonal benefit
we see from tax refunds around this time of the year.
As used vehicle prices normalize, they will become a headwind to the auto charge-off rate. We expect the auto
charge-off rate to increase from the unusually low second quarter level.
Moving to slide 13, I'll discuss our Commercial Banking business. Second quarter ending loan balances were
down 5% year-over-year. Average loans were down 7%. Commercial line utilization continues to be down year-
over-year and we moved $1.5 billion of commercial real estate loans to held for sale.
Quarterly average deposits increased 22% from the second quarter of 2020 and 5% from the linked quarter as
middle market and government customers continued to hold elevated levels of liquidity.
Second quarter revenue was up 3% from the prior year quarter and down 6% from the linked quarter. The linked
quarter decline is more than entirely driven by a one-time cost associated with moving the commercial real estate
loans to held for sale. This decline was offset by an equivalent one-time gain in the other category and is
therefore neutral to the company. Excluding this effect, Commercial Banking revenue would have increased about
13% year-over-year and 4% from the linked quarter.
Provision for credit losses improved significantly compared to the second quarter of 2020, driven by a swing from
an allowance build to an allowance release and a swing from net charge-offs to net recoveries. In the second
quarter, the Commercial Banking annualized charge-off rate was negative 11 basis points. The criticized
performing loan rate was 7.6% and the criticized non-performing loan rate was 1.0%. Our Commercial Banking
business is delivering solid performance as we continue to build our commercial capabilities.
I'll close tonight with some thoughts on our results and our strategic positioning. Several key themes are evident
in our second quarter results. Credit remains strikingly strong. Purchase volume and loans are rebounding. We're
continuing to invest to propel our future results and we're returning capital to our shareholders.
We are seeing increasing near-term opportunities to build our domestic card business as we emerge from the
pandemic. We are leaning further into marketing to seize these opportunities. We are also increasing our
marketing for auto, national banking and our brand.
We are now in the ninth year of a journey to build a modern technology company from the bottom of the tech
stack up. Our progress is accelerating and the stakes are rising. Competitor tech investments are increasing as
technology is increasingly seen as an existential issue. The investment flowing into fintechs is nothing short of
breathtaking. And the war for tech talent continues to escalate, including levels of compensation.
We continue to invest in technology and the opportunities that emerge as our transformation gains traction. Our
modern technology is powering our current performance and setting us up to capitalize on the accelerating digital
revolution in banking.
And now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Jeff.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Absolutely. Thank you so much. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from John
Pancari with Evercore ISI.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good evening. Want to see if I could get your thoughts on payment rates. Did you see a peak in the quarter? And
if not, if you can talk about the timing of inflection. And then, separately, how does that impact your growth
assumption for card receivables and the timing on that front? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Founder, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
John, in our card business, payment rates remain at historically high levels. And as you know, government
stimulus has been amplifying payment rates. And while these programs have been winding down, customer
balance sheets are extremely healthy and payment rates remain elevated.
You can see the payment rate trends in our reported trust metrics. And while not a perfect reflection of our total
portfolio, Q2 payment rates remain at historically high levels. And these high payment rates are muting balanced
growth even as spend is very strong. And of course, the flip side of high payment rates is strikingly strong credit
performance, which drives strong profitability and capital generation. So, we actually are always happy when our
customers are paying at high levels and it's indicative of a healthy consumer. And those high payment rates
correlate with the really strong credit results that we continue to see.
If we look at the monthly numbers, we can see, John, a little bit of easing of the payment rates. I don't know if that
would be a trend to indicate. It certainly would be very plausible to me that as consumers now step up and spend
more and more and they're going out and returning, hopefully, back to normal, it would be a natural thing that
payment rates would ease a little bit here and that also credit metrics would move toward normalizing a little bit.
So, I guess, John, I would say, we've seen the earliest of indications of that, but it's still running at really quite a
breathtaking level.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks. Rich, putting together the comments you made about the significant amount of excess capital and
then the comment in the release about seeing increasing near-term opportunities to build your franchise, could
you talk a little bit about whether you're looking at primarily kind of organic opportunities or inorganic ones as
well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Founder, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Moshe, as you know well, because you've been there from the beginning in following us and having great
insights, we really built our company as sort of wired for organic growth. We installed in the founding days what I
call horizontal accounting, where we track every action and cohort and everything on a lifetime economic basis,
and we measure it before and during and afterward to see how it's going. And so, we always put organic at the
top of the list.
And here's a great example. I mean, while every bank that's – every national bank that's been created has come
through many, many acquisitions, we've had some acquisitions in our journey, but we are really leaning into a
organically driven national growth strategy in banking. And as I said a few minutes ago, we see good organic
growth opportunities, which are partly a function of the market and where it is right now. And very much these
opportunities stand on the shoulders of the technology that we've built and some of the innovation that we're
rolling out.
With respect to acquisitions, we're not putting any energy or a strategic focus on doing bank acquisitions. What
we are looking at is technology acquisitions. And really, in fact, there is a spectrum on the technology side with
respect to fintechs and tech companies. On the continuum, at one end, is just being a partner with them, and then
the next notch on the continuum is being a partner and an investor in them. And you saw that with Snowflake, for
example, and then there are sometimes acquisitions.
All of those have – we've been active in all of those places on the continuum over the last few years. And I'm
struck by the traction and success that we're having. When we look back at some of the acquisitions of little
fintechs, for example, and tech companies, we are very, very pleased with the performance. And in many ways,
these things are generally outperforming. One of the big benefits that we have is that we have a modern tech
stack, so do the fintechs or tech companies that we're buying. And so, the integration and the compatibility, the
ability to attract and then really retain the talent past sort of the contractual period is something that I think leans in
our favor. So, lots of positives there.
There is one big kind of elephant in the room with respect to acquisitions on the tech side and that's the
valuations. So, we've recently gone to a few of these conversations and said love the company, but not at that
price. So, we are very aware about where pricing is. But strategically, I think if you kind of open the aperture and
don't talk about necessarily this very moment, I think for Capital One, it's an organic-first strategy. But acquisitions
of fintechs and tech companies at the right price, and they'll usually be the little ones, I think will help fill out our
business and accelerate our opportunities.

Operator: Absolutely. Next, we'll hear from Kevin Barker with Piper Sandler.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin J. Barker Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thank you. Considering the tightening underwriting that we saw during 2020, do you expect normalized credit to
maybe run below pre-pandemic levels as we go into 2022 and potentially into 2023?

...hearing that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Founder, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Yeah, but I think we – it was a little echoey, but I felt I heard what you were saying there, Kevin. From where we
are right now, which is at an extraordinary benign level that virtually has never been seen before in modern times;
it's got a ways to go to normalize. We are not choosing to make a prediction on where that is not because we
want to be coy about it but because, in fact, I think it's a hard thing to predict these days. What we like to talk
about is the drivers.
So talking about the drivers, the consumer is in a very strong place right now. And I think what's striking is, and I
mentioned this earlier, when you look at what the average consumer – and this is average because the
experience for an individual consumer can be way different from what I'm describing on average. But the
accumulated sort of surplus that consumers have been able to build up is something that even when the
government stimulus monthly benefits ease, I think there is a bit of an accumulated balance there that will be
beneficial for the credit performance of consumers.
So there's really only one way for the credit to go from here and that is in normalizing. I think it starts with a bit of a
head start. And I think that the rate at which it normalizes is going to be pretty linked to consumers' choices on
payment rates. And as I've mentioned earlier, I think it's a natural thing for payment rates to gradually decline and
for credit to gradually normalize. The directions are inevitable. The timing is speculative. Our view is during this
period of time; let's take advantage of the market opportunity that is here, the place the consumer is. But let's also
be cognizant of how markets work, how credit markets work in particular and be on the lookout for some of the
natural indicators of overheating.

Hey, everybody. Thanks for taking my question this afternoon. Look, we're – and this topic has come up a couple
of times. We're looking at the reserve rates and thinking about them in the context of day one reserve levels. I'm
curious how you now reflect on day one allowance coverage and what that could look like on a long-term basis as
we return to normal. I'm curious in particular if you think some of the policy initiatives we've seen during the crisis
change your long-term outlook in terms of potential loss rates.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew M. Young A
Chief Financial Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Thanks, Rick. This is Andrew. I'll take that. And I think as we look at the allowance every quarter, we're going to
take into account a large number of variables and assumptions which would certainly take policy and other
factors. And so as I reflect back on the ratio that we had upon adoption, a lot of things have changed since then.
And so within every single asset class, the mix is going to impact our coverage needs. And then you look at
overall – the balance sheet mix across each of those asset classes will impact things.
So I look at all of those factors and I don't think that the ratio at adoption is necessarily a destination. But I also
think that if you put into the formula like all of the economic assumptions and all of the asset mix, I still believe that
the pre-pandemic coverage ratio can still serve as a very rough benchmark of what coverage ratios might look
like. But again, it'll take into account each successive quarter all of the things that we're looking at in terms of the
mix and broad economic assumptions, including policy as you mentioned.

Just a question here on how you're thinking about the opportunity to invest for that account growth. You indicated
that account growth is up. Maybe give us a sense as to how much more it's up than usual. I know usually you
don't give numbers for that. But it would be helpful to understand the benefit that those marketing dollars is
generating today. And then how much more you think the opportunity set is here to ramp up the marketing in the
back half of the year, given the opportunity set that you have in front of you? Thanks.

because obviously, there was some weakness a year ago in those kind of numbers. So we have seen very solid
performance. We feel really good about the account originations. So we are leaning further into marketing to drive
future growth and also to just continue to build the underlying franchise.
And as we've said, these opportunities are partly because of what the market has to give right now and partly
opportunities that are enhanced by our technology transformation. And the marketing, of course, is especially
going into the card side of the business but also just look on TV, you've seen us steadily investing in national
banking. We're very happy with how that's going. And you may have seen for the first time this quarter that we
have now gone on national TV in the auto side. So these are advertising that is debuting some of the technology
innovations that we have at Capital One, some of the exceptional customer experiences that we've built. And
we're seeing good traction in the origination side of the business. And so we continue to lean into marketing.

Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey, Rich. I was wondering if you could talk a bit about the tech spend outlook. I saw a report that Capital One
was hiring a large amount of software programmers to take advantage of the public cloud move. And then you
mentioned fintech. I was just curious if you thought that the regulatory landscape would ever balance out or if
that's sort of something that's not going to happen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Founder, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Okay. Yes, Don, thank you. So let me talk about tech and the tech hiring. Winning in technology really kind of
begins and ends with one thing, hiring world-class tech talent. And it is the easiest thing to talk about and possibly
the hardest thing to pull off in business today because while this talent principle is true in any business, it is
profoundly true in technology as the demand for world-class tech talent vastly exceeds the supply. So we've built
a tech brand and have had great success in attracting top talent. And we're competing head-to-head with the
leading technology companies in the US. And we've been leaning into tech hiring for years and this is a strong
year of hiring.
Most of the new roles we're hiring for are engineering roles in software development, cloud infrastructure and
machine learning. And these are the most sought after roles in the world and we're getting real traction here. But
essentially, if you pull way up and it's more than just words when we say it; we've really been living this, which is
to, from the ground up, build a technology company that does banking, essentially what Capital One is. The
technology and data are increasingly what the business is. And at the heart of that journey is the tech talent.
I also mentioned one other thing, Don, is that the cost of technology talent is visibly moving upward right in front of
our eyes. And I wanted to flag that to investors. That is just something that – again, it's the natural consequence
of the demand greatly exceeding the supply. So I think it's going to be hard for most companies – for all
companies to do hiring and get the numbers that they want. We are leaning into that. I think we're in a very good
position. But we're going to need to pay appropriately for that talent.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
Don, you asked about fintechs and what we feel about fintechs and possibly a comment on the regulatory side. I
just have a tremendous interest in fintechs and maybe that's because Capital One was an original fintech before
there was such a word. And I look at the fintech marketplace and I think some of these fintechs are bringing great
innovations to the market. And we very carefully study these innovations. And I think that we look at these both as
threats to our business. We look at them as opportunities. Maybe we can partner with the fintechs. In some
cases, there are acquisitions associated with that. And in some cases, what they're doing are beacons of
opportunity that we can pursue.
The fintechs today – I think what banks have to stare at is that fintechs today are benefiting from their modern
cloud-based technologies and their innovative and entrepreneurial approach to disrupting markets, the
tremendous amount of funding that is out there. I mean, for example, these days, the venture capital funding
going into fintechs is close to – I think, I don't have this data right in front of me – but it's close to double the next
category in terms of the amount of venture funding going into this. So, this is pretty electrifying. And the fintechs
benefit from a lower level of regulation than financial institutions have.
Now, I don't think right now the success of fintechs – that one can look at fintechs and say the primary reason
they're succeeding in areas sometimes more than the banks are is because they are less regulated. I think they're
succeeding for the factors that we talked about. I think when you look over time and envision these fintechs with
tremendous growth and being large disruptors, it is an elephant in the room relative to what's the regulatory
context, the capital that they're going to be carrying, the regulatory requirements and the levelness of the playing
field. So, we certainly have a watchful eye on that.
But when we look at the fintechs, the success we're seeing in them, to me, is indicative of the opportunity that
exists to re-imagine banking. And that's what we've been focused on for years. And then if we kind of take our
focus off fintechs for a minute and think about Capital One, like the fintechs, we have a modern technology
infrastructure based in the cloud. We also have other benefits they don't have, [ph] I think (00:43:35) most of
them. We have tremendous customer scale, a powerful brand and literally decades of underwriting and banking
experience.
So when I pull up, I think we and the fintechs are well positioned for success in some ways for the same reasons,
in some ways for different reasons. But I think the biggest takeaway of all of this is that the banking industry is
changing on an accelerated basis. The competition is unbelievably and increasingly well-funded. And we look at
that and we say it indicates the magnitude of change, the magnitude of the opportunity. But it also indicates an
imperative that we need to make sure that during the windows of opportunity that we lean in and invest where we
need to invest because these opportunities won't last forever. Thank you, Don.

Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. I guess I had a follow-up question on the opportunity in the US card for growth. I assume a lot of the
account growth that you're seeing right now is coming in the super prime or the transactor space because of the

growth in transaction volumes. Is that correct? And I guess if we think about the subprime consumer, maybe you
can just talk about what their behaviors are today and how you see growth from that segment unfolding. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Founder, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Sanjay, certainly, what's the biggest newsworthy thing that's happening in the short run is the surge on the super
prime side, the return to travel and entertainment spend powered a lot by heavy spenders. And that you just can
feel in a sense the world pent up and just bursting out. And I think that's sort of the biggest news that we see
inside our numbers as we look at it.
The subprime business, I think, has been more a characteristic of, in general, the sort of mass market of America.
And that is that things have not been as dramatic in terms of pullbacks, nor are they as dramatic in terms of
leaning in. But we've just continued to take the same strategy we've had in the subprime business really in the
prime business for years. And we are carefully leaning into originations and growing the underlying franchise, and
then at the right opportunities, raising the lines when we feel that the opportunity and the conditions warrant it.
So, we continue to lean into originations really across our business. And we are opening up credit lines, gradually
opening up credit lines because we see good results. The consumer is in a pretty good position. Our customers
are in a good place. And you remember, Sanjay, we talked about the sort of years of holding back on that. It's not
like we're unleashing with credit lines right now. But we are sort of net-net more on the opening up side than the
tightening side at the moment. And that's, of course, with a watchful eye on all the key indicators and things that
naturally will change because of how credit markets work.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
So, Rich, you mentioned several times that you're leaning into marketing. I guess, from the outside looking in,
how should we assess the return on these investments? Should it come in the form of accelerating growth or
improved efficiency? And I guess, Rich, just on the efficiency point, we obviously saw improvement year-over-
year for the first time in several quarters. It seems like the top line should be improving. This combined with the
technology investments that you're making, at what point do you think you'll be ready to reintroduce the 42%
efficiency target? Or what do we need to see for you to reinstate a timeline for that? Thanks.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
Richard D. Fairbank A
Founder, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Okay. Thanks. Well, first, a word on marketing. As I said to Betsy, we are leaning into the marketing right now and
sort of leaning a little further into it because what we do is always so Windows-driven, as you know, Ryan. And so
that's where we are on the marketing side. So from an efficiency point of view, you notice pretty high levels of
spending on marketing. Marketing goes up; marketing goes down. But that, at the moment, has been more on the
upside.
Let me turn and one thing I want to say about competition, if I could, just because this is very relevant to these
growth conversations. And then I'll pivot to the efficiency point. Most competitors have been – the feel of their
earnings calls is they too are leaning in to the opportunities that they see at the moment and we see this. We see
competition heating up all around us, especially in rewards where – typically, that's kind of the flashpoints where
you see these things the most. But you see it in the marketing and the media activity. We see it in direct mail
numbers. We see it in the rewards offerings and the heating up of some of that.
Competition is intense right now, Ryan, but it's not yet irrational. But I want to just kind of take the moment to
reflect on what I call sort of the physics of competitive cycles because I've seen this enough that it's pretty much –
you can count on these things happening. Now timing is always the question. But right now, credit is historically
good across the industry and the consumer is in great shape.
The longer this persists, the more competition will likely be to extrapolate these trends to inform their decision
making. And this can embolden them to make more aggressive offers, market more intensely and a particular one
I worry about, loosening underwriting standards. And in this particular environment, the benign rearview mirror
could encourage lenders to reach for growth. And it could be exacerbated by credit modeling that relies on
consumer credit data that, frankly, may be very unique to the downturn and not as good for predicting where
credit performance is going to be over time.
Ryan, if you're building a credit model right now and you're looking back at the data on the last year or two; what
are you going to do with that with respect to what that tells you about the next time things turn down. And there's
also a lot of earnings and capital and liquidity in the system. And then you've got the fintechs that are really
revving up as I talked about earlier.
So even as we're leaning into this opportunity, we remind ourselves every day that the seeds for the next
challenges coming up in the credit cycle as opposed to the economic cycle – in the credit cycle, these seeds are
being planted right now. And so what we do is we don't just look at our models to make decisions. We pull way up
and we have a very watchful eye for the key indicators of these not only likely basically inevitable things to
happen. And then we will act accordingly. We just never want to be surprised.
Let me turn to talk about operating efficiency. We've been focused on improving our operating efficiency ratio for
years. And from 2013 to 2019, we delivered 400 basis points of improvement with the combination of revenue
growth and tight expense management. And of course, the pandemic interrupted our progress particularly on
revenue growth.
Now as it turns out, the pandemic also accelerated the technology race and raised the stakes for all players
across many industries and frankly, particularly in banking. And so as I talked about earlier, I think everyone can
feel the clock ticking, companies, everybody in banking feeling the clock ticking on their tech-readiness, the
investment flowing into fintechs, the arms race for talent. And so we are struck by the emerging opportunities in
the marketplace. They're significant, but the windows aren't unlimited.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
So we feel we're very well-positioned on this. But we are continuing to invest in this moment in our technology and
in the opportunities that we see out there. So meanwhile, we continue to focus on operating efficiency. Our tech
transformation is the engine of long-term efficiency gains both through revenue growth and digital productivity
gains. So continuing to invest in our technology opportunities and driving for efficiency improvements are on a
shared path. So we're still driving toward the same destination of operating efficiency. But the timing of operating
efficiency improvement needs to incorporate the imperatives of the current marketplace. And delivering positive
operating leverage over time continues to be one of the important payoffs of our technology journey and a key
element of how we deliver long-term shareholder value. Thanks, Ryan.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thank you. Rich, as you think about the process of normalization of payment rates and revolve rates that you
described; would you expect that to provide an incremental tailwind to loan growth such that we could actually see
loan growth outpace spending growth as we look ahead?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Founder, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
I think one of the things that I think the banking industry – I mean we've talked about this relationship between
payment rates and growth from time to time. But I think it's been more of an occasional conversation with the
Street. And I think the whole banking industry and the investment community has really sort of collectively gone
through and learned an important lesson here about the metric that really honestly wasn't talked about that much,
which is payment rates and the profound impact payment rates has on both loan growth and in fact, credit
performance. And the striking thing is it's not only empirical, that relationship, but it's intuitive as well, which to me
really reinforces there's something very important here.
Now as I've said to you, we kind of root for higher payment rates because I think it reflects a healthier consumer
even – and we get paid on the credit side and sometimes pay very well as you can see here. But it is a natural
thing that will happen over time. The normalization of credit will very likely come along with the lowering of
payment rates. And that, in turn, is likely – sort of mathematically, all other things being equal, that will be a boost
to loan growth.
So when you say – but I think for those numbers to move significantly enough to, in fact, have loan growth lead
the rate of growth relative to metrics like spending and some of the other things or for us, originations and things
like that; that's got quite a journey to do to get there. I'm not saying that it won't. But I wouldn't run to the bank
counting on a loan growth topping the league tables of the various growth metrics. But I think what is baking, what
really essentially is baking in the oven is a gradual normalization of credit, correspondingly, for the same reason,
a lowering of payment rates. And we are probably seeing the very early – sort of on a monthly basis, the very
early indicators of that phenomenon.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Napoli Q
Analyst, William Blair & Co. LLC
Thank you and good afternoon. Rich, appreciated your comments on fintech and how you're looking at partnering,
buying and et cetera. But I just was hoping to get maybe a little bit more color and your thoughts around what
areas of fintech. I know it's been a few years since you bought Paribus, the online price tracking. But there's a lot
of it. As you talked about all that investment, it's going into a very broad group of – whether it's buy now, pay later,
B2B payments, wealth management, business spend management, kind of charge card business spend
management areas. So I just wondered what areas are most attractive to you where we would see partnerships
or acquisitions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard D. Fairbank A
Founder, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Capital One Financial Corp.
Well, Bob, what we do is – and you mentioned a bunch of interesting areas, for example. But what we do is rather
than say these three areas are our priority areas and let's go look for fintechs; we have a – and it's really one of
the benefits of years on our tech transformation is we see opportunities in a lot of areas across the portfolio of
businesses that we're in. And so rather than say these three here are the priority and let's go see what we can
partner with or buy, what we do is we massively study the fintech marketplace across all the areas that we are
also leaning into. Frankly, we study it beyond that because we can learn a lot.
And then what we do is – the sheer learning alone is worth the effort. And so we go to school on this and we try to
say – and a bunch of times, we say, wow, look at that, they thought of that idea. We didn't at Capital One. Their
good, our bad. But look, let's see what we can learn from that. But also along the way, we look across that
continuum of partnering, investing or buying these things. But as we really look from the other end of the
telescope; rather than what we need, what we look for is what do we find and especially what do we find relative
to a company with the talent and the culture and the business model that would be really accelerative to us.
And so every once in a while, we do an acquisition. But there is a lot of focus on that particular business model.
We always ask ourselves could we build that rather than buy it. And then we really look hard at the talent because
in the end, what really has made our most successful acquisitions has been that the talent comes and stays and
leads, becomes leading executives in the company. And so that's how it works. And a lot of times, we don't buy
anything. But we always come out having learned a lot, Bob. Thank you.
