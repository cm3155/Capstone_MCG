Forward-looking statements that we make are based on management's current expectations and assumptions,
and they're subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause the actual results to materially differ from
expectations are detailed in our earnings materials and the SEC filings available also on our website. Information
about the non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to US GAAP, can also be found in our earnings
material and those are on our website.
So with that, let me turn it over to you, Brian. It's all yours.

Brian T. Moynihan
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Thank you, Lee. And good morning to all and thank you for joining us. This quarter, the economy continued to
make solid progress and our clients continued to perform well having adjusted to the operating environment.
Many companies are making healthy profits and our research team expects another strong quarter of profits by
American businesses.
We reported $7.7 billion in net income, or $0.85 per diluted share, in the third quarter, up significantly from the
year-ago period. We've now earned over $25 billion through the first nine months of the year. This quarter strong
results include some themes that I want to highlight ahead of Paul going through the details on the quarter.
So, prior to the pandemic, Bank of America was growing and creating operating leverage quarter after quarter
after quarter. As I said last quarter, the pre-pandemic organic growth machine has kicked back in. You see that
this quarter and is evident across all our lines of business. In addition, this quarter we saw the return of operating
leverage, we also saw another quarter of solid loan growth. The good news is that the nature of this growth has
broadened in the third quarter, [indiscernible] (00:02:55) even as commercial banking utilization rates have
improved somewhat.
NIIs improved significantly, reflecting the many quarters of growth in deposits and now loans. It also reflects a
steady management of the interest rate risk and deployment of cash from our core deposit growth. At the same
time, we still have a high level of asset sensitivity. We invested in our core deposits and had supported stability in
NII over the last year as rates in loans declined. What that did is bridge us to where we are now. This quarter
where growth in loans and other factors have led to an improvement in NII and in NIM, strong fee growth has
complemented that NII improvement. And with the expenses moving sharply lower, we saw a notable return of
operating leverage. Year-over-year, our revenue is up 12% and expenses were flat. Our efficiency ratios
improved to 63%.
As I've done in the past, I wanted to spend a moment on what we see in our consumer data. Let me hit a few
slides, beginning first on slide 3. The improvement in the vaccination and hospitalizations all the things you know
about, have seen the US economy continue its reopening trajectory following the modest slowdowns in the
surging cases caused by the Delta variant. While there's been some discussion around the slowdown, I would just
note that the US economy is now as large as it was in pre-pandemic.
Our own research team, not being intransigent at all, expects the US economy to grow 5.5% plus this year and
5.2% next year. These growth rates are more than twice the growth rates that occurred in the pre-pandemic
decade or longer. Unemployment rates continue to fall back to pre-pandemic levels. While the US still has issues
around labor supply and supply chains of materials, the economy is moving along.
Looking at our own customer base and consumer spending, I'd offer you a few insights. Third quarter total Bank
of America consumer spending, you can see in the lower left-hand part of the slide, payments were robust. They

reached $937 billion, up 23% over 2019 for the quarter and a similar percent of growth over 2020. September was
the best month of the year and we've seen that spending rates continue through the first part of October.
Combined spend on debit and credit cards, which is a subset of this total, about 20-odd percent of it, in that
retailers and services remained strong. In third quarter 2021, we continue to see spending shift toward travel and
in-person entertainment, as well as fuel driven by both increased use and higher fuel prices.
Year-to-date, you can see in the chart a total payments of $2.8 trillion by our consumers, are 22% ahead of the
2019 levels. In the chart on the right, you can see how fast the growth rates occurred this year and that's another
economic signpost of the steady recovery.
Now, as we turn to loan growth, on slide 4, you can see this chart that we've been presenting to you for last
several quarters. Why do we show you this? We wanted to show you that as we hit the bottom in the inflection
point and what happened a couple of quarters ago. And this chart gives you a sense of the daily progression
across those quarters, as you can see, every loan category has seen improvement. And if I showed you this by
our lines of business, you would see similar progress across each one of them.
Overall, pending loans, excluding PPP loans, which are in the forgiveness process as you well know, overall
those loans increased $16 billion linked quarter. And if you look at the Commercial portfolio, they grew $11 billion
quarter-over-quarter. Compared to growth in Q2, growth this quarter was broad-based across Global Banking and
Global Markets in the commercial space. C&I growth was driven in part by improved calling efforts from
commercial relationship managers that we deployed across the world, including in addition to a growing demand
for credit. As you might note, we've invested in hundreds of relationship managers in our commercial lines of
business and they're now – those investments are now bearing fruit.
Loans with our Wealth Management clients continue to grow this quarter, as these customers borrow for the
reasons they borrow for liquidity and asset purchases and other things. Interesting, in our small business area,
we're seeing the business stabilize and start to grow. One of the areas is our Practice Solutions group. What that
group does is lends to medical, dental and veterinary practices. They continue to see momentum and are on the
pace for the best year they've ever had.
Now, turning to Consumer loans, the American consumer continues to borrow from Bank of America. Card loans
grew 7% annualized from quarter two levels, with increased spending and that as you well know, prepayment
rates trends remain high. All products in the Consumer side except to home equity balances had higher balances
for the quarter. The decline in home equity balance is understandable given the prepayments in mortgage loans,
et cetera, but still, we saw $1.5 billion in originations this quarter, up more than 50% from last year's third quarter.
Now turn your attention to a slide in the Appendix, not to cover it now, but you should take a look there and you'll
see the true loan lending business on the bottom left-hand side of that slide, and you'll see without the volatile
PPP in and out that's occurred there because the program design. The loans this year in those lines of business
are basically within 1% of where they were last year and we can grow out from here.
Moving to slide 5, we want to show they continued, reemerged the pre-pandemic growth machine of Bank of
America. We give you a few highlights. On the deposit side, we grew net Consumer checking accounts, which is
the primary transaction account for our consumers, 92% being primary for the 11th consecutive quarter. This
drove the continued growth in deposits and our leadership position in US retail deposit market share reaching $1
trillion of deposits in our Consumer segment alone.

Our credit cards, we crossed back over 1 million new card production, that's the same level as we were pre-
pandemic. New investment accounts have increased 9% during the pandemic. Digital progress has occurred
across every business and you'll see that in Paul's slides later and that's increased sales of products and high use
of digital platforms. This bodes well for future sales levels and for future efficiency.
Sales of banking products in Merrill Lynch and the private bank have remained strong and with return to in-person
meetings, we should even see them grow stronger.
We have seen year-to-date assets under management flows grow and it nearly tripled compared to year-to-date
2019. In markets and banking, we had record – or near record quarters at both investment banking and equity
trading revenue. So, these are just a few examples of the customer growth we are seeing.
A point or two on capital. This quarter's level of profits coupled with our excess capital, allowed us not only to pay
higher dividends to shareholders, but also to buy back $10 billion in shares. In total, we returned $12 billion to
you, our shareholders, through these actions, proving that we can support our customers in a growing economy,
support our teammates with great pay and benefits, and support our communities as I'll describe in a minute. But
above all, and return capital to you, our shareholders and drive good returns for you.
Going to slide 6, with regard to how our teams are delivering more broadly in our communities, we gave you on
slide 6 an update on our $1.25 billion commitment. To date, we have directly funded nearly $400 million, about
one-third of that commitment. This includes $36 million completed in equity investments in MDIs and CDFIs, $300
million in equity investment commitments to minority-focused funds to support minority and women entrepreneurs
and businesses, and $70 million are directed at philanthropic giving, directed at the priorities shown on the slide in
addition to the amount we usually give on a yearly basis.
Now, it's worth noting that in addition to these equity investments, we have $2.1 billion in deposits in CDFIs and
MDIs, the largest in the US doing that.
If you go to the next slide, slide 7, this is what we're doing with our customers to help live with their financial lives
even better. It highlights the products and services starting in the financial well-being of our retail clients,
particularly in the low-to-moderate income areas we serve. This includes our commitment to our pathways
program, where we hire teammates from our local communities to serve our communities and then be successful
in our company, as the company of opportunity for them. We've recently [ph] re-upped (00:11:17) to hire another
10,000 teammates from our communities over the next five years, that's because we completed the first 10,000 a
year early. The unified ways in which our teammates in local markets to a spectacular job of approaching both
banking from a global scale and both banking from a local community is unique and delivers every day for us. It's
been a great job by our team this quarter and I want to thank them.
Now, I'm going to turn it over to Paul. But as you know, Paul has been our CFO since 2015 and has done a
spectacular job with our company. He's going off to help us do some interesting things in the company and I just
want to congratulate and thank Paul for his support, and I will turn it over and to take you through his last earning
call. Paul?

Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Thanks, Brian. Hello, everyone. I will start on slide 8 by adding a couple of comments on revenue and returns. On
a year-over-year basis, revenue rose 12%. The improvement was driven by a nearly $1 billion increase in NII and
5

a nearly $1.5 billion increase in non-interest income. By the way, every business segment produced year-over-
year improvement in non-interest income.
Expenses declined from Q2 and were flat with Q3 2020 despite the year-over-year improvement in revenue and
related costs. Solid revenue growth while holding expenses flat, created 1,200 basis points of operating leverage
and resulted in $8.3 billion of pre-tax pre-provision income, up 40% year-over-year.
With respect to returns, our return on tangible common equity was 16% and ROA was 99 basis points, both of
which improved nicely from the year-ago period.
Moving to slide 9, the balance sheet expanded modestly versus Q2 to a little more than $3 trillion. After funding
$9 billion of loan growth, deposit growth of $56 billion, generated excess liquidity that was placed in a mixture of
securities and cash.
Our liquidity portfolio grew to $1.1 trillion, or one-third of the balance sheet. Shareholders' equity declined $4.7
billion from Q2, as capital distributions outpaced earnings this quarter.
With respect to regulatory ratios, CET1 under standardized approach was 11.1%, 40 basis points lower than Q2,
driven primarily by a reduction in excess capital through share repurchases and to a lesser degree, higher RWA
as a result of commercial lending growth. The ratio was 160 basis points above our minimum requirement of
9.5%, which translates into a $26 billion capital cushion. Given our deposit growth, our supplementary leverage
ratio declined to 5.6% versus a minimum requirement of 5% which leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet
growth. Our TLAC ratio remained comfortably above our requirements.
Turning to slide 10, I will focus on average loan balances, because they are more closely linked to NII. Note that
loan growth over the past two quarters has begun to show signs of improved demand and I will refer to quarter-
over-quarter improvement on an annualized basis. Also note that these charge include PPP loans, which have
been moving lower driven by forgiveness. The footnotes detail the change in PPP loans.
From a peak of $25 billion last year, PPP loans have declined through forgiveness to a little more than $8 billion
on an [indiscernible] (00:15:11) basis .
Focusing on the link quarter change in loans and excluding PPP loans, total Consumer and Commercial loans
grew on an annualized basis by 9% with Commercial growing 11% and Consumer improving 6%. GWIM
continued to benefit from security-based lending as well as custom lending, while Mortgage continued to perform
solidly. In Global Markets, we again looked for investment grade opportunities with clients as a good use of
liquidity. In Global Banking, we saw utilization move past stabilization this quarter, but utilization rates are still 700
basis points lower than 2019, representing a $30 billion gap from current loan levels. In Consumer, we saw credit
card grow as new accounts continued to build across the quarters and credit spending continued to rebound. And
importantly, in Mortgage, as Brian noted, we saw growth as prepayment volumes slowed.
With respect to deposits, on slide 11, we continued to see significant growth across the client base, adding
accounts across all the deposit-taking businesses. Combining both Consumer and Wealth Management customer
balances, I would highlight that retail deposits grew $28 billion from Q2. These deposits – these clients now
entrust us to manage more than $1.3 trillion in deposits, which is more retail deposits than any other US bank.
We also saw a strong growth of $28 billion with our Commercial clients. And remember, the deposits we are
focused on and gathering are the operational deposits of our customers in both Consumer and wholesale.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2021
Turning to slide 12 and net interest income. On a GAAP, non-FTE basis, NII in Q3 was $11.1 billion, $11.2 billion
on an FTE basis. Net adjusted income increased $965 million from Q3 2020, driven by deposit growth and related
investing of liquidity as well as PPP loan activity. These drivers were partially offset by lower loan levels. NII
versus Q2 2021 was up $861 million. There were several positive contributors to the quarter-over-quarter growth.
First, we had an additional day of interest. We also benefited from the continued deployment and growth of
liquidity. Average loan growth also contributed to NII again this quarter and we experienced an acceleration in the
forgiveness of PPP loans, which improved NII quarter-over-quarter by a couple of hundred million.
Last, but not least, we had lower bond premium amortization expense, which declined from $1.6 billion to a little
more than $1.4 billion.
With respect to PPP loan forgiveness, I would emphasize that this was an acceleration or pull forward of NII into
Q3 from future periods and as a side note, I would point out that the revenue from the PPP program has helped to
defray some of the enormous costs of administrating this assistance program on behalf of the government.
Our net interest yield improved 7 basis points from Q2 to 1.68%, driven by the improvement in NII. Importantly,
given continued deposit growth and low interest rates, our asset sensitivity to rising rates remained significant,
highlighting the value of our deposits and customer relationships.
As we move to Q4 and assuming no significant interest rate changes, we expect benefits from expected loan
growth, liquidity deployment and lower premium amortization expense, to more than offset the expected reduction
in PPP revenue I mentioned.
Assuming the forward curve materializes and given Q3 NII growth as well as expectations for Q4 and assuming
we see any loan and deposit growth next year, we would expect NII and full year 2022 to be well above full year
2021.
Turning to slide 13 and expenses. Q3 expenses were $14.4 billion, an improvement of more than $600 million
versus Q2. Higher revenue-related costs were more than offset by the absence of the prior quarter's contribution
to our charitable foundation, as well as lower costs of unemployment claims processing.
Compared to the year ago period, expenses were flat as improvements in net COVID costs, the absence of
elevated litigation in Q3 2020, as well as digitalization benefits and other initiative savings were offset by higher
revenue-related and other costs. As we look forward, we continue to see investment in technology and people at
a high rate across the businesses, and we are adding new financial centers in certain growth markets.
Turning to asset quality on slide 14. As I've reported for several quarters, the picture is very good here. Net
charge-offs this quarter fell again to $463 million or 20 basis points of average loans. This is the lowest loss rate
in 50 years. Net charge-offs were 22% lower than Q2 and more than 42% below the same quarter in 2019. Our
credit card loss rate was 1.7% and several loan product categories were still in recovery position this quarter.
Provision was a $624 million net benefit, driven primarily by asset quality improvement as delinquencies and
reservable criticized commercial loans continued to move lower. We had a reserve release of $1.1 billion, split
roughly 80% in Commercial and 20% in Consumer.
Our allowance as a percentage of loan to leases ended the quarter at 1.43%, which is still well above the level
following our day one adoption of CECL, especially considering the mix of loans today versus then. To the extent

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2021
the macroeconomic environment and asset quality improves further and remaining uncertainties dissipate, we
expect our reserve levels could move lower.
On slide 15, we show the credit quality metrics for both our Consumer and Commercial portfolios. The only point I
would make here is just to note the continued low level of late-stage delinquency loans, which drives expectation
that card losses could decline yet again in Q4 before leveling off.
Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer on slide 16. Before I touch on the financials, I want
to highlight what a great job this team has done in turning this business around since the pandemic. Of all our
businesses, Consumer Banking was the most heavily impacted by the pandemic, which at its worst drove
quarterly profits to a very narrow level before rebounding. We incurred heavy cost to protect the health of our
associates and customers, and we added contractors and other resources to support the government and our
own customer assistance programs. We added billions to credit reserves, depressing profits as worries mounted
with respect to potential credit losses. Net interest income declined as interest rates fell quickly and significantly.
Fast-forward to this quarter and the segment's rebound has accelerated as earnings rebounded to more than $3
billion. Net charge-offs are at historic lows and NII has rebounded, reflecting not only deposit growth but also the
value of their deposits and customer relationships. The business alone has now crossed over $1 trillion in
deposits, up 16% year-over-year. Our point here is that years of investing and operating under responsible
growth, positioned us to not only deliver for everyone during the pandemic but also rebound quickly to organic
growth and operating leverage. We were never down and we never stopped investing, and while this is true of
every segment, the rebound in our Consumer Banking earnings is just a great illustration of the resiliency of our
business and our people.
The segment earned $3 billion in Q3, 48% higher year-over-year, as revenue, expense and credit cost, all
showed improvement. Revenue improved 10%, reflecting higher card income on increased purchase volumes
and higher service charges due to client activity. Net checking accounts grew more than 700,000 year-to-date and
93% of our consumer checking accounts are primary accounts with an average checking account balance of
more than $10,000. Expenses moved lower by 6% as a result of a continued reduction in COVID costs, mitigated
by higher costs from minimum wage increases and other operating costs.
On credit, we had a $242 million reserve release this quarter. However, the more direct indicator of improved
asset quality is the decline in net charge-offs. Net charge-offs of $489 million were down 26% year-over-year and
22% lower quarter-over-quarter. Our credit card net loss rate for the quarter was 1.7%, pre-pandemic it was over
3%.
On slide 17, you can see the increase in consumer deposits, loans and investments. We covered loans and
deposit growth earlier. With respect to investment balances, we reached a new record of $353 billion, growing
32% year-over-year as customers continue to recognize the value of our online offering. Yes, balance grew as
market values increased, but we also saw $21 billion of client flows. An important element of this growth has been
the 9% growth in the number of accounts over the past year to more than 3 million.
On slide 18, let me highlight a couple of points regarding the continued improvement in digital engagement. As all
of you know, enrollment is important but usage is key. We now have nearly 41 million customers actively using
our industry-leading digital platform. This quarter, 70% of households used some part of our digital platform within
the past 90 days, logging in more than 2.6 billion times. And while Erica and Zelle usage has been tremendous,
what I would draw your attention to is the digital sales growth, which is up 27% year-over-year. Lastly, while not

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2021
reflected on the slide, I would just add digital engagement has become foundational to maintaining our customer
satisfaction at historic levels.
Turning to Wealth Management, the continued economic reopening, client flows and strong market conditions,
once again led to not only record investment balances and asset management fees, but also record levels of loan
and deposits, all contributing to a record pre-tax margin in Q3. In fact, this is the 46th consecutive quarter of
average loan growth in this business. Both Merrill Lynch and the Private Bank contributed to the improvement and
are driving digital engagement to deliver products and services to clients. You can expect this to continue as we
drive towards a modern Merrill, which is advisor-led, powered by digital. Growth in our new households at Merrill
and at the Private Bank continued as we continued to build pipelines and moved back towards our pre-pandemic
pace.
Net income of $1.2 billion improved 64% year-over-year, driven by the strong revenue performance. With respect
to revenue, record AUM fees, which grew 19% year-over-year, complemented higher NII on the back of solid loan
and deposit increases. Expenses increased in alignment with higher revenue. Client balances rose to $3.7 trillion,
up 20% year-over-year, driven by higher market levels as well as strong flows of $91 billion.
Let's skip to slide 21, to highlight our progress in digitally engaging Wealth Management clients. The clients of this
business continued to lead the franchise on digital adoption, utilizing not only digital tools to access their
investments, but also other banking needs like mobile check deposit and lending. More and more clients logged in
to easily trade, check balances and originate loans, all through one simplified sign-on. And through leveraging
Erica-based AI capabilities and through use of Webex meetings and secure text messaging, we are making it
easier and more efficient for clients to do business with us wherever and however they choose. This creates
additional capacity for our teams to spend more time advising existing and potential clients.
Moving to Global Banking on slide 22. The segment had very strong performance with near-record investment
banking fees, another solid quarter of deposit growth and an uptick in loan demand. Strong deposit growth helped
to improve NII, which complemented the continued strength in investment banking. The business earned $2.5
billion, improving $1.6 billion year-over-year, driven by both higher revenue and lower provision costs. Provision
expense reflected a reserve release compared to builds in the year-ago quarter.
Revenue grew 16% and included an 8% improvement in NII, while firm-wide investment banking fees were up
23% to $2.2 billion, down only modestly from the Q1 record level. This IB performance resulted in a number four
ranking in overall fees with a pipeline that remained strong. We ranked number one in leveraged finance and
investment-grade, with strong market share improvement compared to the year-ago period. We also had record
M&A results.
It is worth noting that we continued to see strong momentum in investment banking with our middle market
clients. As many of you know, we have been investing in our investment banking capabilities with middle market
clients for a few years now. Over that time, we have executed transactions for nearly 300 first-time IB clients, and
we now have investment bankers in 23 cities across the US. Non-interest expense increased 7% year-over-year,
primarily reflecting higher revenue-related costs and continued investment in the franchise.
We've already covered much of the balance sheet on slide 23, so let's skip to digital trends on 24. Digital
investments, strategy and tactics are an enterprise effort with learnings in one segment benefiting another. That
has been particularly true in Global Banking. And as we continue to invest – we continue our investments in digital
solutions, our client adoption and usage continues to grow. Enhanced banking solutions have helped us capture

greater market share as wholesale clients do more with banking partners that are the most stable and secure, and
have the capabilities to invest in new technology that will provide better data and global integrated solutions.
Switching to Global Markets on slide 25, results reflect solid sales and trading activity led by our equities
business. As I usually do, I will talk about the segment results excluding DVA. This quarter, net DVA was a
modest loss, but the year-ago quarter had a higher $160 million loss.
Global Markets produced $941 million in earnings, on par with the year-ago quarter. Focusing on year-over-year,
revenue was up 3%, driven by sales and trading. Sales and trading contributed $3.6 billion to total revenue,
improving 9% year-over-year. FICC declined 5%, while equities improved 33%, recording one of its strongest
performances ever.
FICC results reflected a flat yield curve and range-bound interest rates for much of the quarter with continued tight
credit spreads. With interest rates moving late in the quarter, we saw an improvement in activity and revenue
opportunities. The strength in equities was driven by growth in our client financing business, as well as a strong
trading performance and increased client activity in both cash and derivatives. The increase in expense year-
over-year was driven by increased activity related sales and trading costs.
On slide 26, we note year-to-date revenue trends across the last few years. As you can see, while our
performance was elevated in 2020 during the pandemic, 2021 remains well above the pre-pandemic years
presented, driven by continued elevation of client activity and volatility in the markets, as well as investments
made to extend more balance sheet to clients.
Finally, on slide 27, we show All Other, which reported a small net loss. Revenue declined by $109 million year-
over-year, reflecting higher partnership losses on ESG investments. Expense was lower year-over-year, driven by
the absent of litigation accruals in the prior period.
Our effective tax rate this quarter was 14%. Excluding the tax credits driven by our portfolio of ESG investments,
our tax rate would have been roughly 25%. We would expect the tax rate in Q4 to be between 10% and 12%,
absent any tax-law changes or unusual items.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question today from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line
is open.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thanks very, much. Lots of detail. I love the forward-leaning commentary on NII, [audio gap] (00:36:30) bigger
than a breadbox, sized it on the expense side. Obviously, expenses go up a little bit with all this market-related
and activity-related revenue. So, maybe if we could think about it, ex whatever markets are going to do over the
next couple of years, you've [indiscernible] (00:36:47) great operating leverage but as you still invest. So, maybe
you can give us an idea of what to expect, even if it's just over the coming years, as you invest yet, eke out further
efficiency gains. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, I think, Glenn, you might take you back a little bit in history to the 2015 and 2016 when we started seeing
the efforts from the BAC and the operating excellence kick in. And what we said is, we'd bring the expenses down
and then we'd expect them to grow. You sort of have a 3% inflationary between raises and leave aside that the
market is going up, as you said, and it could drive a moment in time, et cetera. But if you had sort of 3% sort of
embedded and CPI type of increases and in merit and rents and things like that, and what we said is through our
efficiency when we got to the sort of floor, which was in the 2019 year, the idea was then to manage that to sort of
1% net growth. And we've been able to keep working at that.
With the PPP and with the COVID-related costs and stuff, it's kind of threw it all around for the last 12 months, but
you'll see that start to emerge, come out the other side. So, the idea would be to grow revenues faster than the
economy and grow expenses at a rate of net 1%, maybe 2%, if the revenue growth is stronger. And that's the
operating model. And you saw that come on quarter after quarter of operating leverage, I think, for basically three
years plus, 14 quarters or something like that. And the pandemic pushed that around. And as we stabilized after
the pandemic, a couple of quarters ago, you're seeing it come back through the systems.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
That's great. So, it sounds like no change and still operating efficiency. Cool. Brian, while we have you, I think
there was like a seven-page press release announcing all the leadership changes. It's a lot. And so, I figure while
we have [audio gap] (00:38:41) can talk about what's happening. How you – is this all natural succession next
level, stepping-up type changes? Maybe to just put the right perspective around it all.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, sure. We announced, we have some teammates who are retiring. I've been CEO, this is 48th quarterly
earnings conference call, so it's been a long time. And I would rather never have to have senior leaders move, but
they have a choice in life and when they retire, we have to adjust to it. But what we try to accomplish, if you go
back to last summer, we put a lot of senior executives on to the management team. What has happened now,
with Anne's retirement, Tom's retirement and Andrea's retirement, is those executives now are reporting directly

to me and that's really the effort. So, we're a younger, more diverse, three women running the eight lines of
business. Same philosophy how we run the company. And now with a group of people who have 5 to 10 years
ahead of them.
And then, we have two international colleagues on the management team for the first time in Bernie and Cathy.
Cathy is needed to help us in the European context as Brexit came through. It's different, in that – so, so she's
going to go help us in that and be a great help to us. Bernie has international, does a great job for us. But the idea
was to elevate people who – and also focus on people who are thinking 10 years out as opposed to one or two
and retirement. So that's really the genesis of it, that people retire and we make reactions.
Tom and Anne and Andrea have been tremendous teammates. But the best thing they did for us, is develop a
bench behind them that is extremely strong, that can step into the jobs and frankly, will run a lot of the businesses
as they – over the last few years as they – we all spent more time on driving our brand in the market now that
things are more [ph] at the (00:40:27) company level.

Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I was hoping to circle back on the net interest income commentary, which was clearly positive
overall. But I think, you've been talking about 4Q net interest income to be up $1 billion versus the first quarter
level on prior calls. And I think, the guidance implies maybe similar to, even better than that. And I was just hoping
to get a little bit more of a point in, kind of update for 4Q in NII.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Sure. So, relative to Q3, we'll have less NII from PPP loan forgiveness. However, we think we should be able to
overcome this decline and produce modest growth in NII in Q4, through a combination of loan growth, liquidity
deployment and modestly lower premium amortization expense.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Which I think, does get you, I guess, so that up $1 billion versus the [ph] $10.3 billion (00:41:36).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2021
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Understood. Okay. And then, secondly, on the expense question, you talked about 1% to 2% growth long term.
But as we think about next year, you obviously had some kind of COVID and I think, some one-time costs in the
first quarter. How would you help frame 2022 costs versus 2021? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So, the way I would think about 2022 – we're not going to provide specific guidance, but as a quarterly base for
2022, just start with our rough estimate of Q3 or Q4 here. Q4 should be flattish to potentially modestly lower than
Q3. So, just start with that as a base and add to that the seasonal higher payroll tax in the first quarter, which is
roughly $350 million. Then as Brian said, add in inflationary costs which we've been, as Brian said, targeting at
around 1%. But given the war for talent, right now maybe want to a little bit more than 1% next year.
And then, lastly, adjust that base for any assumption you make around higher or lower revenue expectations in
the areas that are closely linked to compensation and exchange fees. And if you do that math, you're going to
come up with I think, a pretty good estimate for 2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And anything that we can kind of back out in terms of COVID or the PPP costs going away, as you think
about next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. Look, COVID – there's still a couple of hundred million of net COVID in our costs. It's down modestly from
Q2. We're seeing some reduction in COVID's costs, but we incurred some new costs as people returned to the
office. While there's not a lot left, it does create, I think, modest opportunity over the next year or so to get those
costs out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thanks for all the clarity.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. My question relates to tech [ph] up due (00:44:08), the front office and back office. But the front office, you
have the slide number 5, so net new consumer checking accounts up by half over the past two years. How much
of that is directly or indirectly related to digital banking?
And then my back office question, which we don't really see, is what are you doing as it relates to the cloud, your
relationship with IBM? What sort of efficiencies do you think you can get? And I think, you indicated you don't plan
to go 100% to the public cloud like some of your other peers have targeted. So if you could elaborate on your tech
strategy. Thanks.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2021
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So, Mike, on the first, the production of net new checking accounts and you remember, Mike, this is not – you've
been around us a long time and these are core checking accounts, so the primary keeps going up. It actually went
from 92% to 93% over the last year, the primary accounts. So, the production hit this quarter was, I think, a 10-
year high in terms of net accounts, and that's coming both from the digital's 50% of sales, round numbers. And we
now have, to your point, over the last three years developed full digital execution in terms of account opening for
core accounts in terms of auto purchases, in terms of mortgage origination, et cetera, which now allows a fully
digital practice to take place, half the sales are digital.
The good news, honestly, is that as the branches reopened over the last – and people, the visits went up, you
saw the accounts so it would rise, because it takes both high touch and high tech to be successful. So, the
percentage in sales of digital came down, but that's because overall sales jumped up and obviously that more
branch dominated.
But you've got it exactly right. We think that is a more efficient method of accumulating customers. We think we
have about 17% market share in the Gen Z area that is heavily digitally originated. Lot of [ph] colleges (00:46:14)
lot of other things going on, but the key is to realize that net balances per account have gone from 7,000 to
10,000 over the last couple of years. So, you're seeing a bigger and bigger core position.
When you go with – and that's one thing to keep in mind is, when you give you our [indiscernible] (00:46:28)
digital customers, these customers are core customers with big balances. So, Merrill Edge, for example, I think
we're up to $70,000 or something average balance per account, not $3,000 or $4,000.
But anyway, just on the cloud. The cloud is a complex question. So, as you are well aware, over the last 8, 10
years, Cathy and the team led an effort to internalize our cloud, which made us lot more efficient. And so, we look
at – we run a percentage of our business outside due to certain executions and things like that. We have 500
different software programs that run in a SaaS, the SaaS basis, which is, the question of cloud can be misleading
as can you get to the all the product types or capability types you can get there, because of the new companies
that develop them on the cloud-based systems. And we can get to them all.
The idea was an effort to internalize the cloud that we can use as a financial service industry and IBM is working
on that. But these things have to be done carefully for purposes of security and trust and understanding our
businesses. And so far, we've come to the judgment that we're continuing to internalize and saving a lot of
money. And we continue to add modest amounts to the cloud. But importantly, there's no restraint on our ability to
tap innovation or ingenuity based on whether it's running internally or externally.

Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Good. Gerard, how are you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good. Can you guys share with us, you've had an incredible deposit growth as you pointed out, the retail,
consumer areas over $1 trillion. When the Fed ends QE sometime next year, can you share with us what you
think will happen to deposit growth? And second, your loan to deposit ratio, similar to your peers, is very low. How
do you see growing that over the next two or three years? And where can you get it to, do you think?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Paul, why don't you add a few comments on the change in monetary policy? And I'll talk a little bit about sort of
some of the other thing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So, look, we expect deposit growth to continue, although it's going to be likely at a slower rate than what
was experienced so far this year. And we expect our growth to continue in line with or slightly better than the
industry. You've got to remember that we're entering a phase of tapering, tapering is still QE, so deposits are
really not likely to decline until many quarters. If you look back at historical data, after QE ends, if they ever do,
because as the economy expands, the multiplier effect, we could see growth in deposits even though money
supply is coming down. So, we'll just have to wait and see. But what we do know is, as QE starts, we're still going
to be stimulative from a deposit standpoint. And then, as I said, if deposits do decline, it'll probably be many
quarters or a couple years maybe, after QE ends.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, Gerard. Just a couple things. When looking at the consumer deposit base, sometimes I think its déjà vu all
over again. It's a classic statement, because in 2015, 2016, 2017, it was all about the Fed's going to normalize
rates and you're going to have to raise prices. And we didn't have to, because the reason why we don't have to is,
these are core transactional accounts in a large part, not interest-bearing. And so, you'll see some of that same
dynamic apply again as the rates normalize and the monetary supply is changed. But in the Consumer business,
56% of the balances are checking, so that would say, those are core transaction accounts, money moving in and
out, very little CDs, I think $50 billion, $60 billion, or something like that.
So, the $1 trillion, it's all basically in checking and money markets. So can it move around? Yes. If you look, one
of the things that bodes well for the economy is that if you look at checking customer that has maybe $2,000 or
$3,000 in balances with us, they're sitting with three times of what they had before the crisis. That's good news.
They will spend some of that I assume, but interestingly enough, that's been growing month over month for the
last few months. So it's not going down even though the stimulus payments to customers in large part, other than
the childcare, stopped. So, one thing that bodes well for the economy and this isn't trying to [indiscernible]
(00:51:12) you to some viewpoint about it, is that consumers still has a lot of money in their accounts and they're
going to spend it.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2021
Going back to your deposit question, could that mean those balances come down a little bit? But it'd be overcome
by the new accounts coming on at a million a year that carry a $10,000 average balance, et cetera. So, we feel
good about long-term deposit growth and it's driven by the checking and core transactions.
Loan-to-deposit ratio, it's our customers drive it. So, when the usage by the auto dealer lines is down to 25% of
what it was because inventory is being down, of course they want to borrow, we want to lend to them because
that means they have the inventory to sell to the consumer. So, this is a customer-driven business and so, $900
billion-odd of loans against $2 trillion of deposits is largely driven by the customer activity. The good news is, you
can see in those charts that I call the smile charts on the loan growth page there, that the other half of the smile is
coming up, meaning that the customers are starting to draw on credit and use it. And that'll bode well for the
customer growing their businesses and stuff, but importantly, thinking about just the economy generally.
One of the things I just want to – that I'll remind you of, Gerard, is we break out Consumer and GWIM, and a lot of
people talk about retail deposits. That is $1.3 trillion when you combine them together, so is a big machine and it's
all transactional. And we just don't think that moves as much on monetary supply questions as, obviously, the
institutional side.

Morning, Betsy.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. Hey, Brian. I wanted to ask, we've got a setup into 2022 that looks pretty positive, especially
when you think about the top-down GDP growth you were mentioning earlier. How are you leaning into that with
regard to your footprint? Where do you see the biggest opportunity for share gain across your business platform?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So, I'd say there's a of couple areas. One, as you're well aware of, we've expanded the balance sheet in the
markets business and are seeing that returns on that, stronger in the equities business and good. And Jim
DeMare and the team under Tom's leadership continue to do a bit strong in the equities business, in that – so
deploying balance sheet against that, recognizing the activity level, sustaining, et cetera.
And then, if you go in the lending business, it's customer selection. So we were out with those 100 extra
relationship managers banging away at the world, getting more customers the hard way. And you're seeing net
new customers in the business bank and small business segments and stuff growing. You see that in the Wealth
Management business.

So, what you'll see is that the balance sheet deployed to markets is a capital and balance sheet question.
Everywhere else, it's going to follow the customer, but it's the core customer growth and that's why you put those
statistics in that you see.
Meanwhile Merrill Edge is over $300 billion and becoming a fairly significant enterprise on its own. And you see
some of these other aspects. So, we feel good about it. And like you said, Candace and the team run a great
research platform and they basically are 5% plus this year and 5% next year, which sets up well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
So, is there an opportunity that's even larger outside the US? I'm just thinking about your franchise outside the US
borders, is that an engine of growth for you potentially here, relative to what you've been doing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. We'll invest – we'll continue to expand our – we have more loans in the Global Corporate and Investment
Banking segment outside the US than we do inside the US and we continue to expand that. Matthew Koder and
team have done a good job, lead the client and team in the corporate banking area doing a great job. So, yes,
we're going to invest in that. And then the GTS, Faiz Ahmad and the team, and continue to develop our
capabilities there, and we're getting high single-digit revenue growth off the deposits and fees combined together.
And we continue to invest in that real-time payments and it's just one thing after another. So, we're doing that.
But outside which – yeah, I don't – if the question is are we going to change and go into the Consumer business
or Wealth Management business outside the US, the opportunities in the Consumer business or just in the Wealth
Management business in the US are staggering to us. Think about we just opened our 15th branch in
Indianapolis. You and I would have been talking four years ago and I don't think we had any, [ph] maybe just five
(00:55:37). We're now seventh in market share, moving up strong. You look at it in Columbus, in Cleveland, in
Cincinnati, in Salt Lake City, in Minneapolis, and you're seeing us move in the top five, seven, from zero. And that
growth in the new households is running multiples of 2019 in Merrill and the Private Bank. There's just so much
opportunity to distract ourselves, would be not the time to do it. We're in a war with the competition and we're
winning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then just lastly. Paul, you were mentioning how you've got bigger than breadbox on growth in NII as
you look into next year and you outlined the drivers. I'm just wondering, embedded in that is a forward curve.
What about opportunity here for the forward curve to shift higher? When you're thinking about the increase in NII,
if we had inflation come through stronger, rates rise sooner, would that be an opportunity for you to take even
more duration than you've got in the book, or would you keep the securities duration where it is today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Look, we have a lot of excess liquidity right now. So, there's always an opportunity to deploy some of that in the
future. We're always balancing liquidity, capital and earnings. And if rates rise, I think we probably would have to
study whether we want to deploy some of that liquidity at higher rates. We've got our interest rate sensitivity
disclosure, which is probably the best way to talk about the opportunity if rates were to rise. It fits today, because
of our liability [ph] insensitivity (00:57:13), the value of those deposits as customer relationships as Brian just

talked about, that's sitting at $7.7 billion for a parallel shift. 70% of that is on the short-end. So that gives you a
sense of maybe the opportunity here as rates rise.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A

Yes, I mean, simply put, we manage it dynamically, the board manages it dynamically on a quarterly basis and
what's happening is, if you look at where we thought we'd be, we're ending up with more capital because we're
earning more money. And then we clean up a little bit here and there. But we're working towards, over multi-

Actually, my question was asked. But on the NII, you're – if you just extrapolate third, fourth quarter kind of
guidance, you're looking at a mid-single digit rate of growth year-over-year in 2022 and I think, you used the word

providing specific guidance on 2022. But let me just give you a couple of reminders and qualifiers that it's going to
depend, NII is going to depend on loan and deposit growth and we expect both of those to continue to grow,
consistent with a growing economy. We also are expecting lower premium amortization expense over time,
consistent with the [ph] path for forward (01:00:35) rates. When all the guidance we ever give you is always
dependent on the forward curve at that moment, so assuming the current forward curve and given our
expectations around improvement in NII in the second half of this year, we've already booked the third quarter,
I've given you guidance on the fourth quarter, that one could expect I think robust improvement in NII comparing
the full year 2021 versus the full year 2022.
By the way I want to correct one thing I said earlier. I mentioned that our asset sensitivity, 100 basis points rise
parallel shift to the curve was $7.7 billion, it's actually $7.2 billion. So, sorry for that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
But – so, on the interest rate structures, what I'm thinking about and please help me here, there's a significant
amount of liquidity on bank balance sheets that's being put – waiting to be put to work. And I'm wondering if that
doesn't put somewhat of a cap on how much rates can rise? And then, you're going to have some decline in
treasury issuance, because of the declining budget deficit and then you're still going to have QE, at least, through
the first half of next year. So, you've got a lot of demand for shrinking supply on the treasury side. So that's why
I'm curious what sort of rate structure, either nominal or curve-wise, you're anticipating going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. All the factors that you're talking about go into it, but use the curve and so all you market participants and
all of the debate, we don't use some internal estimate. So, we've always used the curve and we've been doing

that for a long, long time, going back a couple of decades. So that's how we build that estimate of the asset
sensitivity based on the forward curve at the time, at the end of the quarter whenever we calculate it.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hey. Good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. So, wanted to start off with one just on the tax rate
guidance. And Paul, you've always provided with these helpful color on how to think about some of the potential
fee income drag as well associated with those ESG -related investments, recognizing that the impacts are
intended to be P&L neutral. I was hoping you can help size just how we should be thinking about the other income
drag related to the guidance for 4Q and whether you guys would consider a potential change to the accounting,
just given all the noise and volatility that that creates in the income statement?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. Look, we expect our ESG activities to increase over time, so as we go into 2022 and 2023. And as we long
talked about, the fourth quarter is generally the highest for that pre-tax – for that loss that we book in other income
for entering into these partnerships. I do think it's important to remind everybody. I know, you know it but I'll
remind everybody that these partnership losses are booked in other income, but they're more than offset in the
tax line. So as we grow these activities in the future, there will be a small headwind to revenue growth, but not to
net income growth, given the tax benefits of these investments.
As you think about modeling, everybody out there, we expect the fourth quarter loss to be $800 million on the
other income line from these tax investments or even perhaps a little higher, reflecting both the sort of typical
seasonal increase in the fourth quarter and partnership investments, as well as there were a few deals in the third
quarter that got delayed because of all the logistical stuff and we think they're going to pop into the fourth quarter.
Beyond that, putting the fourth quarter aside, a good modeling assumption for the normal three-quarters of 2022, I
would say, absent unusual items, it'll be quarterly loss of kind of $400 million to $500 million for those ESG
investments. Again, in the other income line more than made up for in the tax line.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thanks for that color, Paul. And just for my follow-up, I know you guys are reluctant to give some explicit expense
guidance for next year, just given the sheer amount of like inbound that we've gotten after you made your
remarks, I just wanted to at least provide some ranges and just see if we thinking about things appropriately. It
does sound like the $14.4 billion we saw this quarter, annualizing that as a jumping off point that gets us the 57.6.
You have the $250 million of additional incentive expense or seasonal expense, sorry, that you spoke to, that gets
us to 57.9 and then that's the starting point for thinking about how much incremental growth somewhere in that
range of 1% to 2%. Is that the right way to think about it?

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2021
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
You got some but not all the components, because you got the COVID-related expenses and what happens next
year. But I think, the leading things for everybody to focus on is watch the head count, because at end of the day
if you think about the expense base, it's dominated by people and the buildings and the equipment they operate
on and positioning them for success. And that head count now is drifting down as it has, because the impact of
the run off for some of the special programs that we had the 0.5 million PPP loans, 2 million customer deferral
applications, the unemployment payments, all those stuff it's going down. And that's coming down, so in client-
facing, investments in technology stuff that goes up, but we continue to engineer the back office.
But watch that number. I think, it was 209,400 this quarter, 200.411 if I got it right, down for the quarter, down for
the year. Managers are down about 1,000 in the company, round numbers at this point and we just continue to
manage that down. So, you've got the component parts that have come clear. We sort of brought the run rate
back down to flat year-over-year and we'll continue to work on it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. The only other thing that I would add, Brian, if I may, we're clearly focused on managing expenses well, but
what we're really focused on is creating operating leverage. And you saw that this quarter and that's how we
really think about the business model. We've got to grow revenue and in terms of expense growth, we've got to
grow expenses slower than we're growing revenue and we've given you the sort of 1 percentage framework.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
All right, that's great. And just one quick follow-up if I may. Just on the securities yield, you guys actually saw
some nice expansion there. I know that's going to be reflected at least in part of some of the premium and benefit
that was cited. I was hoping you could maybe help frame how large could that benefit be from premium am, if
prepay speeds really start to normalize in earnest? Some are closer to pre-COVID levels. And then separately,
just where are you reinvesting along the curve and how you're thinking about duration and risk appetite, given the
size of your MBS portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. I mean, if you think about premium amortization expense over time, it's going to depend on the path of
rates and I just would remind you that prepayments lags movements in mortgage rates. People tend to focus on
the 10-year, it's about mortgage rates. And they lag that by a little more than two months. And I would also just
remind everybody that as you think about premiumization expense, it's also important to really remember that the
size of the sort of the securities portfolio has increased a lot year-over-year. So, all those things sort of have to go
into your modeling.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 14-Oct-2021
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just a question or two on card. Interesting to see that your purchase credit card
volumes continued to grow really nicely and debit did come down a little bit, so did the overall interchange fees.
Just wondering if you can talk through what you're just seeing in terms of the underlying trend there? And is that
stimulus starting to change as far as debit or was it Delta variant? And just what do you see in terms of the
forward outlook for in terms of your views of spend trend and balances in card? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Sure. Well, look in card income, just a couple of points to make, just so no one's confused. When you look at our
sort of Consumer Banking card income fees, they were up very nicely year over year at about 8%, driven, as you
said, by the purchase volume increases despite the fact that payment rates were still relatively high. But when you
look at the consolidated line, you're not going to see that. It's up only slightly versus Q3 2020, because of the
decline in card income associated with processing unemployment claims, which sits in Global Markets. So, just
some clarification there.
In terms of balances, look, we're expecting card balances to continue to improve. That balances grew 7% quarter
over quarter on an annualized basis, including some small growth in revolving balances and we opened over 1
million new accounts which now matches pre-pandemic levels. I think, balance growth reflected higher spend and
the reinitiated marketing efforts that we talked about, including promo offers, while again payment rates remained
elevated. We expect higher Q4 seasonal purchase volume and that's going to drive additional balances in cards.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. I think, just a couple things. You got the balance question on cards, but you do always have to look at the
spending side of it. And we said, debit and credit cards are only about 20-percent-odd of the way consumers
spend money out of accounts. Cash, out of the ATMs, checks written, Zelle is taking off and becoming a
meaningful amount of the payments. So, I think that cards are an easy form of payment. We're already seeing tap
cards and things at 12% of the penetration already, so.
But the good news is, no matter how you cut it and how you look at it, there are two good messages. Card
balances are growing, but there's still tremendous capacity for the consumers to borrow if they want to do things.
The second thing is that the spending levels are growing at 10% growth rates. An economy in the US which is led
by the American consumer, that is a tremendous amount of spending that's going on and it's accelerating even as
the stimulus is not – is in the rearview mirror by quite a many months. So, as people get back to work in higher
wages and things, there's just more money to spend.
So I think, the focus on card as a spending vehicle versus a borrowing vehicle would be or will be something we
look at. But we like the business, we continue to generate 1 million new cards, as Paul talked about and it will
break down about who needs to borrow and what. And the asset quality is unbelievable. The NIM is high as it's
ever been. And that's a good business.

Great. Thanks a lot, guys.

Operator: Our final question comes from Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Morning, Chris.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Kotowski Q
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Yeah. Good morning and thank you. I'm trying to kind of disaggregate the strength in net interest income and just
wanted to make sure I have all the moving parts right. So, the PPP revenues were up $166 million and
amortization was down $200 million. It's still kind of implies like a $500 million or roughly 5%, kind of linked
quarter growth in NII, up against, say, 1.5% average loan growth, if I have that right. Is there an explanation for
that strength? Is it's the securities you put on or is it – how did it become quite that strong?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
You got to add an extra day.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Kotowski Q
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Extra day. Okay, that's 1% more.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
And then, what you're left with, I think, is the loan growth for two quarters now. And we took in a lot of deposits
quarter-over-quarter. We put some of those towards the loan growth, we put some of those in cash and we put
some of those in the securities portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Kotowski Q
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Okay. And if you had to guess, if with the size of the securities portfolio that you have now, if you were in a, say,
2017 kind of rate environment, the $1.4 billion in amortization currently, what would that go to, if you can say?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
You can look at that by just tracking CPRs and make your estimates. You know the size of the portfolio and the
basis. But just backing up a little bit, this loan growth, in the first quarter we said, we thought we were seeing the
stabilization and there was a lot of people fulminated against that saying, wait, how can that be true? The second
quarter, we said – in the second half of the quarter especially, we saw growth. All that loan stayed on the books,
plus we grew it on top of that as we said earlier, I think $16 billion, excluding the PPP. That's what's going to build
into the NII projections going forward, because that's 250, 300 basis point spread stuff.

And remember, we're funding it with zero cost deposits to the tune of $200 million to $300 billion, up year-over-
year. So that's what will drive it long term. Short-term, it will be all the things you talked about. But that's going to
stabilize it somewhere at a point and then it's really going to come back down to what we do on the banking side
of the balance sheet, make loans, take deposits and make the spread between them. And the best news is the
NIM percentage actually started moving up, and that shows you that the stabilization leads to that coming true as
we grow the loans.

Chris Kotowski Q
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
It was an awesome quarter. Thank you. That's it for me. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
We agree with that. That's all?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
All right. Thank you, all for your attention. Just to close the quarter out, I could just take Chris' comment and say,
we've returned to organic growth trends seen pre-pandemic. We saw solid loan demand, good revenue growth,
12% year-over-year, expenses flat year-over-year for great operating leverage of 12%, returning to that effort to
drive that quarter-by-quarter to make the great investments to drive the franchise, at the same time having
expense discipline. $12 billion of capital went back to you this quarter. We'll continue to return the excess capital
and all the current earnings, because frankly, we can grow without retaining capital because of the core way we
run the business on a risk basis. We continue to do what we need to do in our communities outside at the same
time.
And just in closing, I want to thank Paul for his service as CFO and we look forward to Alastair and the team
taking over next quarter. Thank you.
