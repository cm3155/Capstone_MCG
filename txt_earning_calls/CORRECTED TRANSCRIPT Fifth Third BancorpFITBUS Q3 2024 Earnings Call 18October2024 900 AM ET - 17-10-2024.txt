Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
Timothy N. Spence
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Thanks, Matt, and good morning everyone. At Fifth Third, we believe great banks distinguish themselves not by
how they perform in benign environments, but rather by how they navigate uncertain ones. Our focus on stability,
profitability, and growth, in that order, has served us well in this dynamic operating environment and continues to
produce strong and predictable results.
This morning, we reported earnings per share of $0.78, or $0.85 excluding certain items outlined on page 2 of the
release, exceeding the guidance we provided in our second quarter earnings call. We produced a return on equity
of 12.8%, the best among peers who have reported thus far and the most stable on a trailing 12-month basis. Our
adjusted efficiency ratio improved to 56.1% in the third quarter. Head count declined 1% year-over-year despite
continued investments in our growth strategies.
We achieved sequential positive operating leverage for the second consecutive quarter without the need to
expend shareholder capital on an investment portfolio restructuring charge and are in a position to achieve
positive operating leverage on both the sequential and the year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter. Despite
changes throughout the year on interest rates, economic activity, and market demand, as we come into the
homestretch for 2024, I am pleased to say that Fifth Third should deliver NII, fees, expenses, and credit costs
within the full year guidance ranges we provided back in our January earnings call.
Before I hand the call over to Bryan to provide additional detail on our financial results and outlook, I would like to
take a minute to highlight the ways in which our strategic growth investments, which have been consistent over
several years, are providing long-term organic growth that is not macro environment dependent.
In our Consumer Bank, consumer households grew 2.7% over the prior year, punctuated by 6% household
growth in the Southeast. The release of the FDIC's annual summary of deposits during the quarter provided an
additional means to benchmark our performance. For the second year in a row, Fifth Third was number one
among all large banks in year-over-year retail deposit growth measured on a capped branch deposit basis.
We maintained or improved our market position in every market where we compete. In our Midwest markets, we
maintained our number two overall position behind JPMorgan. In our Southeast markets, we maintained our
number six overall position and significantly closed the gap to our top five goal. We grew retail deposits nearly
16% year-over-year and gained meaningful market share in 14 of our 15 focused MSAs in the Southeast. We will
open up 19 de novo branch locations in the fourth quarter, and plan to accelerate the pace of openings through
2028, at which time we will have nearly half our network, or more than 500 branches in total, in the Southeast.
In our Commercial Bank, we continued to expand our middle market presence and to invest in commercial
payments. Over the past 12 months, we have increased relationship manager head count by over 20% in our
Southeast and expansion markets, including opening commercial banking offices in Birmingham, Kansas City,
and in the Central Valley. Third quarter middle market loan production was the highest in five quarters, led by the
Southeast markets, which were up 20% sequentially and over 30% over the prior year.
Our commercial payments business grew net fee equivalent revenues by 10% year-over-year in the quarter, and
we processed $4.3 trillion dollar volume. New line in our managed service offerings continued to lead the way in
terms of growth that is delinked from our balance sheet. Over 40% of all new commercial payments relationships
added this year have been payments led with no credit attached.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
In our Wealth and Asset Management business, we achieved record quarterly revenues, growing by 12% year-
over-year. Total assets under management have grown $12 billion in the past year, or up 21% to $69 billion. Our
Fifth Third Private Bank, Fifth Third Securities, and Fifth Third Wealth Advisors business units all continued to
generate strong performance.
Turning to capital, our strong profitability and disciplined balance sheet management are providing growth
capacity and the opportunity to increase capital return to shareholders. This quarter, we increased our common
dividend by 6% to $0.37 per share, and executed $200 million in share repurchases. Even with these actions, our
CET1 ratio increased to 10.8%. This will allow us to increase share repurchases in the fourth quarter by $300
million with the potential to increase further depending on the level of loan growth realized during the quarter.
Looking ahead to the remainder of the year and the beginning of next, while we feel more optimistic today about
the near-term outlook for the economy, we also recognize that crosscurrents, including reversals in interest rate
rallies, volatility and jobs reports, stickiness and inflation, and geopolitical uncertainty could produce a wide range
of potential economic outcomes. We will continue to manage Fifth Third with a focus on stability, profitability, and
growth, in that order, and to stay liquid and conservatively positioned while investing with the long term in mind.
Lastly, I'd like to take a moment to express our sympathies to all those who have been impacted by Hurricane
Helene and Hurricane Milton. We recognize the hardships that arise from such devastating events, and I would
like to also thank all our employees who have answered the call to support our customers and communities at this
time. In the days since the hurricanes, you've worked tirelessly to reopen branches and check in on customers.
You staffed the Fifth Third Financial Empowerment bus to enable those who lost power and Internet access to
apply for FEMA disaster relief. Your dedication to serve in the face of these natural disasters is inspiring. Thank
you for living our core values.
With that, I will turn it over to Bryan to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook.

Bryan D. Preston
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Thanks, Tim, and thank you to everyone joining us today. We're pleased that our third quarter results once again
demonstrated the strength of our company. Our well-positioned balance sheet and diversified fee income streams
drove 3% sequential adjusted revenue growth. That revenue performance, combined with our ongoing expense
discipline, resulted in 5% sequential pre-provision net revenue growth in the third quarter on an adjusted basis.
As Tim mentioned, our profitability remained strong, which allowed us to continue to accrete capital while
repurchasing shares and raising the quarterly common dividend 6%. Our CET1 ratio grew to 10.8% at the end of
the quarter, and our tangible book value per share, inclusive of AOCI, increased 14% compared to June 30 and
47% from a year ago.
Highlighted on page two of our release, our reported results were impacted by certain items, including costs
related to the Visa/Mastercard interchange litigation and some severance recognized during the quarter as we
continue to work to drive efficiencies and automation.
Net interest income for the quarter was over $1.4 billion and increased 2% sequentially, and net interest margin
improved 2 basis points. Increased yields on new loan production were the primary driver of this improvement and
more than offset the impact of increased interest-bearing core deposit costs, which were well-managed and up
only 2 basis points compared to the prior quarter. With the Fed funds rate cut at the end of the quarter, in

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
September, we experienced our first month-over-month decrease in interest-bearing core deposit costs during
this rate cycle.
While total average portfolio loans and leases were flat sequentially, we are seeing some signs of life. Loan
production rebounded for both middle market and corporate banking, with strong contributions from the Georgia
and Chicago regions, as well as the energy and TMT verticals. For the Commercial portfolio, average loans
decreased 1%, primarily due to increased pay downs and softness in revolver utilization, which declined 1%
during the quarter to 35%.
Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases were up 1% from the prior quarter, primarily reflecting an
increase in indirect auto originations, which continued to be a significant contributor to our fixed rate asset
repricing. During the quarter, we saw a 200 basis points of pickup on the front book-back book repricing in this
portfolio.
Diving further into deposits, average core deposits were up 1% sequentially, driven by higher money market
balances, offset by a decrease in savings and CDs. This core deposit balance performance, combined with our
well-timed long-term debt issuance during the quarter, has allowed us to pay down higher-cost, short-term
wholesale borrowings. As a result, our rates paid on total interest-bearing liabilities decreased 1 basis point
sequentially.
Our current focus remains on prudently managing deposit costs, as we have officially entered the rate-cutting
cycle. Since mid-2023, we have been increasing our testing of price sensitivity in our deposit book to be well-
prepared for this phase of the cycle. We remain confident in our ability to manage liability costs to drive net
interest income performance in the fourth quarter and beyond.
Demand deposit balances as a percent of core deposits were 24% during the third quarter, down 1% from the
prior quarter. This level is consistent with our expectations from July, and we expect DDA mix to stay around 24%
for the remainder of the year.
By segment, average Consumer and Wealth deposits were stable sequentially, while Commercial deposits
increased 3%. We ended the quarter with full Category 1 LCR compliance at 132%, and our loan-to-core deposit
ratio was 71%, down 1% from the prior quarter.
Moving on to fees. Excluding the impact of the security gains and the Visa total return swap, adjusted non-interest
income increased 2% compared to the year-ago quarter. As Tim mentioned, our Commercial payments and
Wealth businesses delivered strong fee results with both achieving double-digit revenue growth over the prior
year, driven by our sustained strategic organic growth investments in products and sales personnel. In
Commercial payments, revenue increased 10% as we continue to acquire new clients in traditional treasury
management products, our managed service offerings, and in new line.
In Wealth, our AUM increased to $69 billion, up 21% over the prior year, driven by strong inflows from Fifth Third
Wealth Advisors and market performance. Fees of $163 million this quarter were a record high, led by strong
transactional activity at Fifth Third Securities and the fee benefit from the AUM growth.
Our capital markets business rebounded this quarter as bond issuance and trading, as well as rate hedging
activities picked up. Fees grew 9% over the prior year, also led by our debt capital markets business. The security
gains of $10 million were from the mark-to-market impact of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan, which
is more than offset in compensation expense.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
Moving to expenses, excluding these items noted on page 2 of our release, our adjusted non-interest expense
was up 3% from the year-ago quarter and increased 2% sequentially, primarily due to increases in performance-
based compensation due to the strong fee generation, the impact of the previously mentioned non-qualified
deferred compensation mark-to-market, and continued investments in technology, branches, and sales personnel.
Shifting to credit, the net charge-off ratio was 48 basis points, slightly better than our expectations from early
September and down 1 basis point sequentially. Commercial charge-offs were 40 basis points, down 5 basis
points sequentially. And Consumer charge-offs were 62 basis points, up 5 basis points from a seasonally low
second quarter. Early stage delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due decreased 2 basis points to 24 basis points,
which remained near the lowest levels we have experienced over the last decade.
NPAs increased $82 million during the quarter, and the NPA ratio increased 7 basis points to 62 basis points, in
line with our 10-year average, and remains below the peer median level. Commercial NPAs increased $60 million
from the prior quarter. Within our C&I portfolio, NPAs increased $20 million due to increased inflow activity, which,
given the nature of the Commercial business, will be uneven from quarter-to-quarter. On a year-over-year basis,
C&I NPAs are down $7 million.
Our CRE portfolio continues to perform well, with no net charge-offs during the quarter and an NPA ratio of only
46 basis points. The increase in our Commercial mortgage NPA is related to a single senior living credit in our
owner-occupied portfolio. Consumer NPAs increased $20 million from the prior quarter.
Approximately half of this increase was driven by a recent change in policy related to our consumer non-accrual
processes to better align our policies across asset classes, and primarily impacted our return-to-accrual timing for
loans that are paying in full and current. Overall, we are not seeing any broad credit weakening across industries
or geographies. From a credit perspective, we do not expect Hurricane Helene to have a material impact on
losses, and we are continuing to assess the impact of Hurricane Milton.
Our ACL coverage ratio increased 1 basis point to 2.09%, and included an $18 million reserve bill. We continue to
utilize Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance and made no changes to our scenario
weightings.
Moving to capital. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10.8%, significantly exceeding our buffered
minimum of 7.7%, reflecting strong capital levels. Our pro forma CET1 ratio, including the AOCI impact of the
securities portfolio, is 8.7%. We expect continued improvement in the unrealized losses in our securities portfolio,
given that 59% of the AFS portfolio is in bullet or locked out securities, which provides a high degree of certainty
to our principal cash flow expectations. Assuming the forward curve is realized, approximately 24% of the AOCI
related to securities losses will accrete back into equity by the end of 2025, increasing tangible book value per
share by 6% before considering any future earnings. 61% of the securities-related AOCI should accrete back to
equity by the end of 2028.
During the quarter, we completed $200 million in share repurchases, which reduced our share count by 4.9 million
shares. As we assess our capital priorities, we continue to believe that 10.5% is an appropriate near-term
operating level.
Moving to our current outlook, we anticipate continued growth in NII and NIM during the fourth quarter, with NII up
1% sequentially, reflecting the impact of lower deposit rates and the continued benefit of fixed rate asset repricing,
partially offset by the decrease in yield from our floating rate loan portfolio. This outlook assumes a 25-basis-point

cut in November and a 50-basis-point cut in December. We would not expect any change to this outlook if fewer
rate cuts were to occur. We expect average total loan balances to be stable to up 1% from the third quarter, with
middle market and auto production offsetting mixed demand in the other asset classes.
Fourth quarter adjusted non-interest income is anticipated to rise 3% to 4% compared to the strong third quarter,
largely due to a continued rebound in capital markets revenue and continued growth in Commercial payments.
Additionally, we expect fourth quarter TRA revenue to be $10 million, down from $22 million in the fourth quarter
of 2023. Fourth quarter total adjusted noninterest expenses are expected to be stable compared to the third
quarter, as the increases in revenue-based compensation and the investments in branches and technology are
largely offset by efficiencies achieved in other areas.
Fourth quarter net charge-offs are projected to be similar or slightly down from the third quarter. Given the
expected increase in loans during the fourth quarter, we anticipate an ACL build of $20 million to $40 million,
assuming no major change to the economic outlook. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage in the fourth
quarter on both a sequential and a year-over-year basis, and our PPNR guidance for the full year remains in line
with our guidance from back in January. Our net interest income trajectory exiting the year continues to position
us for record results in 2025, assuming no major economic or interest rate outlook changes.
Finally, moving to capital, with our consistent and strong earnings, we now expect to increase our share
repurchases in the fourth quarter to $300 million, with potential further repurchases depending on the level of loan
growth throughout the quarter.
In summary, with our well-positioned balance sheet, growing revenue streams, and disciplined expense and credit
risk management, we are set to generate strong and stable capital accretion, top quartile profitability, and long-
term value for shareholders, customers, communities, and employees.
With that, let me turn it over to Matt to open the call up for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your first question
comes from the line of Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the call. Bryan, I was hoping you – hey. I was hoping you might be
able to discuss sort of just the main puts and takes you see in the fourth quarter NII guide. In particular, curious
about how you're thinking about the further trajectory of deposit betas and sort of how that evolves over time,
given that you've been very transparent about it and have an optimistic outlook there as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan D. Preston A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah, absolutely. We continue to feel really good about the trajectory of the NII as well as the performance on the
deposit front. And as you know, we've spent a lot of time being prepared for this point in the cycle and things are
playing out basically as we expected. When we look at both our results and peer results, the natural transition that
you would expect is brokered deposits, wholesale funding, borrowings to start to come down. That's what we're
seeing at the scene play out. And then also then to start to see when that has been fully realized, that movement
in the beta. And that's exactly what we're seeing from us and the competition.
For us, $35 billion of the index deposits, we were able to get the beta out of those, as expected. To-date, we're
about in the mid-40s in terms of the betas that we've achieved since the 50-basis-point rate cut, and we still have
$13 billion, $14 billion of CDs that will be approaching maturities. About 75% of our CD portfolio matures between
now and the end of the first quarter, as well as some additional promos that we'll see maturities on. And we'll
continue to grind through the deposit cost in other areas of the book. So, continue to feel really good about that as
the trajectory plays out. And then the fixed rate asset repricing and that benefit continues to be a sequential
tailwind for us, and that's going to continue into the fourth quarter and next year. And that will be a big driver of the
increase in NII from here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Maybe looking at it a little further, I know you've discussed generating record NII in
2025. Would love to hear any updated thoughts there. I guess including what kind of lending rebound might be
required to achieve that. It sounded like maybe a bit more optimistic on what lending demand might look like given
some of the signs of life you referred to in your opening remarks?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan D. Preston A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah, we are. We are seeing some more activity there. We don't need heroic loan growth to deliver record NII.
How the NII is delivered is obviously going to be very environment dependent. So, shape of the curve is going to
matter. We do expect to start to see some tailwinds on the loan growth side given what we've seen. The
decreases from a commercial perspective, we think, for the most part, are behind us. And we're seeing nice
tailwinds in the Consumer businesses. That will be a big driver of how we transition into the loan growth from

here. So, we would like to see a little bit of loan growth. That certainly would be helpful in terms of delivering that
record NII, but we feel good about the trajectory from here.

Hi, Tim. Hi, Bryan.

Timothy N. Spence A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Can you guys – I posed this question to one of your peers yesterday. And when I framed it out, part of the
response was it was a rosy outlook. So, I'll give that as a caveat to you. But can you share with us? I'm curious.
And we're not – I'm not asking for a specific 2025 guidance, but if the Fed continues with dropping rates the way
they appear to be in terms of the forward curve and their own outlook, and we actually go from an inverted yield
curve that we've lived with for over two years now to a positively sloping curve where the front end drops to 3%,
3.5%, the long end stays around 4% to 4.5%, can you share with us what kind of impact that may have on your
net interest income growth for 2025?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan D. Preston A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Obviously, Gerard, we'll give more detail next year on 2025, but if we can actually get a little bit more
steepness in the curve, get the inversion out of the curve, that is very powerful for us from an NII perspective from
here because we would expect to see some relief on the liability side of the balance sheet. We do continue to
have confidence that we would get costs out. And the thing that's not reflected in our forward guidance right now
is an assumption that we're going to be able to maintain the fixed rate asset spreads. We do assume that there is
compression as rates come down. And if we were to get to a normal-shaped curve, there would be even more
benefit then from the fixed rate asset repricing, and we would also have a little bit of opportunity to get some – a
little bit more economics out of duration in the security portfolio and then the swap portfolio over time. So, that'd
be a really productive environment for us. And we would see it – over time, you would see a significant expansion
moving forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
And at least for what it's worth, Gerard, I don't know that I see your outlook as being overly rosy in that regard. I
just think it's probably a reflection of what both the Fed's actions and the data would tell us is realistic. It probably
feels rosy because we just haven't seen an environment like that over a very long time – in a very long time
period, probably 20 years or something like that, right? Either we had absolute rates at zero on the front end and

a little bit of slope or we've had this situation now where the front end was elevated and you had a historic level of
inversion without a recession.
If the Fed manages to land the plane here, the front end comes down, I think our view has been that the 10-year
was probably going to be stickier. Just you're talking about, on an intermediate-term basis, inherently more
inflationary dynamics, including the domestic manufacturing industrial policy, the green energy transition, the
historic level of fiscal deficits that were running. Like, those are all things that should work against the long end of
the curve moving meaningfully lower. And potentially even you could see, if the Fed settles out at the 3% or 3.5%,
the long end of the curve move up a little bit so you get more of a normal term premium. That sort of an
environment, if it doesn't come along with some other issue, would be a really wonderful one for the balance
sheet portion of our revenue.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then can you guys remind us, you talked about lifting up the buyback a bit in the fourth quarter.
Bryan, you talked about how the tangible book value accretion, how it's going to come through just the burn off of
that – in the securities portfolio through the end of 2025. Can you remind us, in an environment where you know
what the Basel III end game requirements are, which hopefully we will – obviously by this time next year, what
should we expect in terms of how much of the capital that you guys are comfortable giving back to shareholders
as a percentage of earnings, for example, in dividends and buybacks?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan D. Preston A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Our target right now, in a normalized environment, we like being in, say, a 35% to 45% range from a
dividend payout ratio perspective. The share buyback ultimately is driven by how much capacity we have relative
to organic growth because we do – our preference would be to continue to invest on the organic front when we
see good risk-adjusted returns. And then with what's left, we manage capital via the share buybacks.
We continue to feel good with the capital generation that we've been seeing, that $200 million or $300 million of
share buyback feel about the right level. This quarter, we saw a little bit of benefit in RWA, which allows us to
potentially have a little bit more share buyback. But, with some loan growth coming in next year hopefully, we'll be
talking about a little bit lower buyback over time, just because we've got a lot more organic opportunities to invest
in.

Hey, just to follow up on the – you said the loan production is the highest in five quarters, and then quarter-over-
quarter loan growth is flat, right? So, if you could just give a little bit more detail like how much would loans have
grown without pay downs? And why aren't you seeing more of this? It sounds like you said there's signs of life,
but is it bigger than a breadbox, sort of what you think might come ahead? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan D. Preston A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Thanks, Mike. The pay downs for the quarter were around, say, $900 million. A bit elevated from what we
would typically see in some of the portfolios, as well as we had a utilization headwind of about 1% because we did
see the revolver utilization move down. That 1% decrease is another, say, $800 million. So, the combination of
those two were a decent driver ultimately from a overall average loan growth and end-of-period loan growth
perspective.
We're not expecting continued pressures at this point, and we've seen utilization stabilize in the second half of the
quarter and in the beginning of this quarter. So that doesn't feel like a headwind for us right now. The capital
markets activity, obviously, it was a very robust capital markets activity in the third quarter. We do think that fed
into some of the pay down behaviors that we're seeing. But, from here, we're expecting to get back to a little bit
more normalized level, and we think that helps then with loan growth from here.

And as far as if you had to pencil in kind of expectations for the next several quarters or over the next year, are
you willing to give us any number yet? You think it'll be more than 1% or 2% or – I mean, I'm sure you're going to

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan D. Preston A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. I mean, we gave average loan growth guide obviously of up 1% sequentially. We'll get into 2025 in more
detail next year. But, in general, our objective would be to grow with the market plus 1 point or 2 points.
Historically, the banking industry grows in line with GDP, nominal GDP-type levels. And if we get back to that kind
of environment and the industry gets back to overall aggregate growth, we would expect to be in line if not
outperform the industry.

wins the election, and probably more importantly, what of the things that both candidates are campaigning on
actually make their way into policy and how they elect to govern.
What we hear from clients, when I'm out in the field, is that it's, one, the elevated level of rates have been
challenging because there's capital investments that don't make sense, that just don't pencil out in an
environment where rates are higher; two, because they are uncertain about what we're going to see in the
election, they have been using cash flow from the businesses to pay down debt in lieu of investing it in other
places; and three, you have this big build up in inventory at the 2021, 2022, 2023 timeframe associated with
people moving. I think we referred to it as the shift from just in time to just in case in inventories.
As rates came up, we have seen – I think the term for it that one of our distribution clients, our wholesale
distribution clients use when I was out with them last week was destocking. So, less inventory, less building
material across supply chains, which in turn – and a focus on more inventory turns, just getting the balance sheet
to work harder, which reduces the revolving credit borrowing needs. That can't go to zero, so you're not going to
have a headwind there. If interest rates come down and more M&A and capital investment starts to make sense,
that hasn't worked, you should see a pickup on that front.
And then if we continue to see more certainty as it relates to the trajectory of the economy and have the
uncertainty attached to the election out of the equation, I think we could see a better environment across the
banking system. And that, coupled with the sales head counts that we continue to make, we referenced that in the
prepared remarks, should support the at-to-above market growth rate on the lending side of the equation that
Bryan referenced earlier.

I guess just a couple of follow-ups. One, maybe starting with loan growth, Tim, you mentioned. Two things. One,
from a Fifth Third standpoint, are we still lapping de-risking, or running off the Shared National Credit book, I think
it's down 11% year-over-year. Just give us your sense of is that book going to continue to decline as you kind of
reduce your exposure there? And secondly, in your business, are you seeing any competition from non-bank
direct lenders, private credit that looks different today than it would have three, four, five years ago?

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
Timothy N. Spence A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah, sure. Good question. So, we should be at the inflection point on the sort of impact of the RWA diet by the
end of the year. I think we talked last year about the fact that we were trying to get everything done in the fourth
quarter. There would be a little bit of a spill over into the first as you just got through normal timing. But we should
be reaching the inflection point on that front where you don't have the – less de-risking, Ebrahim, than a focus on
what would the profitability, the unit economics of those relationships look like in a world where you had different
perspective on capital levels and the value of the corporate cash that comes along with some of those larger
relationships.
As it relates to private credit, like we do see it at the margins, principally in leveraged lending space. What I would
tell you has happened is they're focus on less structure, faster execution then has a little bit of a bleed over in
other areas. And there is no question that things that some of the private lenders are willing to do are not in line
with the way that we want to run our portfolio. I think it was the Financial Times or the Journal, but there was a
piece about a week ago in the paper that talked about payment in kind, or where I come from, negative
amortization lending was between a quarter and a third of the portfolios at most of the major private credit shops.
That is definitely not something you would ever see at Fifth Third in an environment where the economic
backdrop is benign, and where you don't have a large percentage of your companies operating at distressed
levels. It's just odd to see that amount of PIK lending going on. So, they're willing to do those things and we're not.
By definition, they're going to scrape the most indebted companies out of the banking sector.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan D. Preston A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
And, Ebrahim, this is Bryan. We put a little bit of detail on the SNC portfolio on slide 24 of our slide, and we have
$31 billion portfolio. It's down 11% year-over-year. So, we are still facing – lapping some of that headwind.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
But was the point that – we had at a point where that $31.2 billion is close to where this book should bottom out?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan D. Preston A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
I think you're going to continue to see some runoff, but we do think we're getting back to the point where you'll
start to see some production coming in and offsetting it. It may not be exactly at the floor, but the decreases
should definitely be moderating.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
The CIB pipeline, the middle market pipeline, which I think we referenced in response to Mike's question, is at an
all-time-record level, and the CIB pipeline, which would be where the majority of the Shared National Credits
would originate is at the highest level it has been in the year. So, you're seeing the turn there, which should
support the decline in runoff, increase in production, and an inflection point in loan balances.

And just the other question on capital allocation means your stock's done well. I'm not saying it's expensive, but it
stayed well on tangible book when you look at it. Why not hold excess capital as opposed to picking up the pace
of buybacks given that we might be in an improving economy? If that happens, more capital, good for growth. If
it's worse, it adds defensibility. Just talk through in terms of how you go through capital allocation and the whole
discussion or analysis around holding on and building some more excess dry powder as opposed to accelerating
buybacks from here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan D. Preston A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. I mean, feel really good [indiscernible] (00:38:48) about the earnings trajectory of the company. And we
think – given that, we feel like our stock is – it continues to be a good bargain for us, and we think it's a good
investment for us from a corporate perspective. We look at a couple of things on that front. We're generating a lot
of capital every quarter, and so that actually gives us the ability to be very dynamic with our capital allocation
decision. We have a lot of confidence that we're going to be able to generate the capital necessary for organic
growth. And then if we wanted to slow down capital distribution via share buybacks because we see more
opportunity or we need to get more defensive, we would be able to do that.
Another component is just when you think about our industry and the 10% cost of equity, sitting on excess capital
is a high cost for our shareholders. And so being in a position as we are right now and being able to go ahead and
make some decisions and deploy at a time where we continue to feel really positive about our trajectory as a
company and knowing that we have the flexibility with the income profile and the stability that we have going
forward to generate the capital when we would need to, and if we think different opportunities would present
themselves, that's really the thought process on how we're thinking about capital allocation from here.

My first question is for you, Bryan. So, you indicated that your deposit beta so far on the recent cuts are in the
mid-40s. As we think about the speed of index deposit repricing and then retail, could you give us a sense of what
14

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
you think the cadence could be as we go through the next five quarters? So, a few of your peers have noted that
it might not be a straight line path to the terminal beta given how quickly corporate can reprice and retail sort of
been awoken, so to speak, in terms of higher rates. So, if you could speak to that and maybe speak a little bit to,
as you think about your [indiscernible] (00:41:11) deposits, we haven't seen a neutral rate that's not zero for so
long. So, maybe help us get a sense of, if we get a neutral rate of 2.75% or 3%, what do you think your natural
spread is or natural deposit rate is in that environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan D. Preston A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. I mean, that is obviously a very interesting question. The shape of the curve is going to matter a lot in that
scenario as well. When we think about the pacing of how the beta will come through, like you said, it is – the
Commercial deposits will come through very quickly. The retail takes a little bit longer. The two primary drivers for
us on that, it's the guarantee periods on the promotional offerings, which tend to be between say 45 and 90 days,
and then it's the maturities of your CD portfolio. As I mentioned earlier, 75% of our CDs will mature between now
and the end of the first quarter. So, to get the rest of the beta and get to that kind of cumulative beta that we have
been targeting, where in the high 50s kind of beta, for us, it will take about two quarters because the CD repricing
is going to be a component of that. Now, that's $13 billion in the book.
From a natural level perspective, I think that is really tough to estimate. I mean, we're sitting here. At peak rates,
we were at a 2.99-ish was our peak interest-bearing core deposit costs versus 5.50% Fed funds level. We would
expect to see a little bit of compression potentially in that spread. But being able to maintain 150 basis points to
200 basis points of deposit spread seems like a potentially achievable scenario.
One big question on that, Erika, another one that would obviously be a big question is just where does -
how does the magnitude of loan growth change over time? And if you've got a decent curve shape, back to
Gerard's question, and you've got opportunities for loan growth, you're going to have some opportunities to be a
little bit more competitive, to raise more deposits, and ultimately drive better NII. And at the end of the day, we're
not managing the deposit betas. We're managing the NII and profitability trajectory, and those are the decisions
and the trade-offs we'll make.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And my second question is for Tim. Tim, the feedback from investors has always been quite positive in
terms of the forward-looking way of how you look at the world. And as we think about 2025, I guess it doesn't – it
feels like – given record NII and your fee income should benefit if activity levels come back in general in an even
bigger way next year, it feels like the expense run rate that you posted year-over-year this quarter, the 3%, it feels
more appropriate obviously assuming that revenue grow above that. As we think about 2025, is it right for us to –
until we get guides when you put growth and expenses as a placeholder. And as we think about 2025, what are
the big projects that you feel like you're ready to retackle and revisit that you may have pulled back on in 2024
because the NII dollars were coming down?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yes. So, thank you. I think there was a compliment and a question in there, and I appreciate both. You've heard
me reference I think the old saying that Cincinnati invented hustle in the past. That dates back to Pete Rose's
nickname, and the fact that he sprinted to first base on a walk I think. That Ethos is I think a part of the way that

we try to run the company, right, is to sprint to first on a walk. So, we try to work on next year's problems and the
year after that this year, as opposed to waiting for that environment to materialize.
And part of why I think we made the NIM turn, right, our NIM trough and then grew in the first quarter before most
of our peers, the NII inflected positive in the second quarter over the first quarter, which was before most of the
peers. We got to real sequential positive operating leverage this quarter versus the last quarter. And we're saying
we'll get there year-over-year next year. But none of that involved us holding back on investments we thought
were important to the company or would make sense, right? We're going to have built 30-plus branches this year
in an environment where we were trying to manage expenses. We continued forward on the platform
modernization. The acquisitions we made on the commercial payments side of fintech companies last year, we've
continued to feed this year. And the hiring, as I mentioned, on the sales force both in Wealth Management and in
the middle market had been pretty significant.
So, you should expect us to do the same sorts of things next year and to expect the company, through other
efficiency initiatives, to help self-fund the investments along the way. And we don't view strategic planning as an
investment request process. It's principally a resource allocation process. So, I don't know that I helped you with a
specific number for 2025. You have to wait till January to get that. But the annualized expense run rate of the
bank over a period of time has been call it 3%, if you look at it. So, that certainly, if you were going to use the
past, averaged through more benign periods and more challenging periods would be where you'd start.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning. I wanted to ask about index deposits. Can you talk about how they've behaved over time?
So, I guess the question is that, as rates fall and the rates on those index deposits fall, is there a chance that
some of those move into other deposit products with exception pricing or does that not really happen based on
historical experience?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan D. Preston A
Chief Financial Officer &
Executive Vice President,
Fifth Third Bancorp
Well, you'll see some people that try to do some negotiations on deposit costs. Those are things that always
occur, but those are things that we are typically able to manage fairly well. The reality is you get paid a better
spread as a depositor on an index deposit because you're taking the risk ultimately on market movements,
whereas on a managed account, it's typically a wider spread because we have more ability to manage it. So, it's
something that we've had good experience with behaving, controlling it through our pricing and through our

discipline around that process. We're not overly concerned about reverse migration from index back into
mandatory being a headwind from a beta perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And then maybe just separately on credit, on slide 28, you're showing NCOs and NPAs reaching
normalized levels. I mean, I know you noted that you're not seeing any signs of credit weakening. Can you give us
some more color there? What gives you some confidence that things are just normalizing here? Is it that rates are
going down so that helps you on the credit side? Is it just what you're seeing on the rolled rates? Maybe what
helps this to stabilize from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Greg Schroeck A
Executive Vice President, Chief Credit Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. It's Greg. I'll take that one. A couple of things. Look at our delinquencies and delinquencies continue to be
at all-time-low levels. Our criticized assets actually went down by $8 million quarter-over-quarter. We had the
increase in NPAs on the Commercial side. Those were driven by five names in five different industries. We've
been very consistent in talking about a very diverse portfolio, and it continues to be very diverse.
On the Consumer side, we're seeing a little bit of softness on dividend, see a little bit of softness in the RV
portfolio. When you look at the 2022/2023 origination vintages, they're underperforming across many of the
Consumer asset classes. We see the same thing in the portfolio, specifically in dividend and RV. But the
securitization data from other originators would tell you the same thing. We're actually outperforming those
indexes, that securitization data, by almost 50, 60 basis points.
And so, I would expect dividend to be a little bit elevated for the next quarter or two, but I'm highly confident that
we will work through those vintages and it comes back down to a more normalized level in that 1%, 1.25% level.
So, we're just not seeing anything within the portfolios, Commercial or Consumer, that's causing additional
concern. It's been pretty stable.
Our borrowers have continued to behave. You've seen these commercial real estate portfolio. We've got virtually
no delinquencies; very, very minimal non-performing assets in that Commercial real estate portfolio. So, across
the board, that diversification, that strategic play of building out a through-the-cycle portfolio has played well for
us, and I would expect that to continue in the future.

Good morning. On slide 10, you've got some pie charts here you showed before, just showing the mix shift from
the Midwest to being more balanced. And I guess the question is, as we look out in the next few years, you show
the split getting to 50/50, which is still a pretty meaningful re-shift from here. So, how do you get there? Is it simply
harvesting what you've done, a combination of harvesting and building? Is there a buy component of that as well?

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2024
Timothy N. Spence A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. There's no buy component in there. That's the old-fashioned way, which is one new branch at a time, and
the right marketing and product strategies to support the increase in distribution. So, if you look at the branches
we've built, Matt, they're performing very well. We've talked in the past about the fact that the performance at this
stage and having built more than 100 of them is pretty predictable. And they reach a point where they sort of
saturate their catchment area in about seven years, right? They breakeven within two, and then they make this
pivot to continuing growth.
So, the average age of the de novo right now is going to be like, call it, two years, two-and-a-half years at the
most. So, there is a five-year tailwind we'll get from the 100 that are already in the ground and operational, plus
we have been building about 30 to 35 a year. That number should move up into the sort of 40 to 50 range on an
annualized basis just based on what we have in the pipeline. And as those branches come online, you will see
that mix shift play out first in the allocation of the physical distribution, and then behind that, over time, as they
mature, the mix of the deposit base on the retail side overall.

Matt O'Connor Q

Matt O'Connor Q

Thank you. And then, just separately, I know there's been a lot of discussion on net interest income and kind of
drivers of the NIM, and I'm sorry if I missed it, but have you guys talked about this concept of like normalized
NIM? Looking out a few years, as you get the fixed rate asset repricing and whatever rates to break the forward
curve, any concept of normalized NIM?

Bryan D. Preston A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. I mean, it's – again, it's another tough one because what does the environment look like? What does the
shape of the curve look like out in the future? If you just take the cash position that we're holding today, we're
north of $20 billion of cash, we're up almost $9 billion year-over-year, every $1 billion of excess cash that we're

holding is a 1.5 basis points on NIM. So, just getting $10 billion out over the next year, and hopefully having some
opportunities to deploy that into the loan portfolio, that could add 15 to 20 basis points to our NIM alone.
We're going to see NIM grow from here, just with the continued repricing of the portfolio. From a fixed rate asset
perspective, that will continue to take – that just takes a little bit more time to play out. But if you get a little bit of
relief on the front end or a more normalized curve, get the front end down, I mean, it's not unreasonable to think
we could be talking about getting back to what was a 3.15% to 3.25% NIM in a reasonable time horizon.

Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about some of the large banks who have been placed under regulatory
orders this year. Does that create new business opportunities for you beyond your already organic pipeline?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
I mean, I think any time there's a limit on someone else's ability to grow, it means that the rest of the industry has
to have the capacity to be able to absorb the growth in the market. So, I guess, in that sense, yes, just tactically. I
think more strategically the more disciplined you are about the way you run your business, the better you do in
moments when there's any sort of disruption somewhere else, right? So, I wouldn't wish significant regulatory
problems on anybody. They're no fun to work through. But they do tend to create opportunities at the margins for
other banks that are in a strong position and have the ability to grow in an environment where others may not.

Great, Tim. Thank you for that. And just a quick follow-up on sort of asset returns over time. Does lower interest
rates help you get your returns or does it make it more challenging?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan D. Preston A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Lower interest rates, as long as that comes along with a normalization of the yield curve, would certainly be very
helpful to returns over time. A low, flat curve is a challenging environment for the banking system.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey, I was just wondering – this is a big picture question. You guys give the sense that you're investing more for
growth than others. Do you have any metric on how much you make in your organic investments and what sort of
returns you get on those? I'm thinking about the Southeast branches or Wealth or Commercial payments, and it
kind of goes back at our earlier question. Maybe you shouldn't buy back so much stock if you have so many
opportunities for growth or high class problem if you get there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. I mean, we look at all of these things. The easiest, comparable across the different investment types is
probably just IRR, Mike, right, and time to breakeven. So, the IRR of the branches in the Southeast has been
running in the 18% to 20% range, and the time to breakeven has been a couple of years, right? If you were to
look at the small acquisitions we've made to support Commercial payments, we were targeting IRRs in the 20s in
those cases, in part because you had a more nascent business and it's less predictable after then – when you
built 100 branches and you know what you're going to get out of the next location that you build.
So, in general, we feel really good about anything that we can get done in that sort of 15% to 25% range, subject
to the execution risk that's attached. The more uncertain, the more nascent the strategy, the higher the return you
would expect to get out of it. And the more proven strategies, obviously, the lower the execution risk premium that
you would need to place on them.
I don't think we are constraining the investment rate. Like if you just look at the Southeast, JPMorgan has built the
most branches down there over the course of the past five years. They're at 180 or something like that. I think
Fifth Third is number two, and I believe BofA is number three. And then there's a pretty wide gap between that
and everybody else. And I know I don't have to tell you that we're a little bit smaller than BofA and JPMorgan. So,
we are we think being appropriately aggressive in terms of the investment rate down there, and at least at the
moment, I don't know that – if we said, hey, we're not going to buy back stock, we don't have an alternative use
for that capital on an organic basis that we would be thinking that we would deploy it toward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan D. Preston A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Mike, we are accelerating the investments, as Tim mentioned, on the proven strategies. It's part of why
we're going from what was 20 to 30 branches over a year to 50-plus branch over a year. So, we have more
confidence. That gives us a point of view of an area we want to invest in. And then the other limiter for us is
always going to be the analysts that are worried about positive operating leverage because that's the tradeoff we
care about as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Just to push back on that last point, I mean, I hear you, if you get those sorts of IRR and you're accelerating your
branch build, but this come at a time when I think some of the Southeast competitors have woken up, recovered
like you less unrealized securities losses, going from defense to offense. So, you have that change versus the last
few years. And you also have the likes of some of those big banks that you mentioned spending so much more in
technology and digital. So, don't you think it might be tougher in the next few years than it's been in the past few
years?

Timothy N. Spence A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Oh, I don't know. I don't think that the Southeast was uncompetitive the last five years, right? I think what you're
just – you're constantly looking at is are we making the right set of investments, given the competitors that we
have and our value proposition relative to others? I completely agree the amount of money that is getting
deployed into technology investment on the part of the large banks is eye popping. But if you look at the value
proposition, like go pull up the lead consumer checking account offering for any of those large banks and for Fifth
Third or some other regional, and tell me how that materialized into some substantially better value proposition.
I actually think, in many cases, what you would see is the opposite is it's been the regionals who led on
consumer-friendly product innovation. It's definitely been true of Fifth Third, but it's not just been Fifth Third in
terms of the offerings there. So, we are not running the bank to be able to take share in uncompetitive
environments. We run the bank to be able to take share in very competitive environments and I expect the level of
competition is going to stay high, not that it's going to get better or, for that matter, get worse.
