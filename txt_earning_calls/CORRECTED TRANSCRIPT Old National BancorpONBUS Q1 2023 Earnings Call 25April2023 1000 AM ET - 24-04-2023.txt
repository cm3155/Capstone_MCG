Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Good morning. On the morning of April 10th, our Old National family was blindsided by unthinkable tragedy. In the
span of minutes, five of our team members were lost forever, while other team members and two Louisville Metro
police officers suffered injuries. All Old National team members are out of the hospital and on the road to
recovery. One Louisville officer remains in the hospital. In the aftermath of this tragedy, many heroes emerged,
including members of law enforcement, city and state officials, the amazing Louisville medical community and

some of our own team members who were there on the scene. To all of you, thank you from the bottom of our
hearts.
On behalf of everyone at Old National, I also want to thank the entire community of Louisville for your
unconditional love, prayers and support. I also want to acknowledge the overwhelming outreach from individuals
and organizations throughout the country. Your outpouring of love and care has helped strengthen us, and we are
so grateful.
Turning to the quarter. We reported strong first quarter earnings despite a rapid shift in the operating environment
for all banks. For Old National, it was business as usual even throughout March, and the strength of our franchise
remains evident in the results outlined on slide four. Adjusted EPS was $0.54 per common share with adjusted
ROA and ROATCE of 1.4% and 23.4%, respectively. Our adjusted efficiency ratio remained under 50%.
Obviously, deposits, liquidity and credit are in focus today. As you can see, deposit balances were stable during
the quarter, despite the normal first quarter seasonal patterns and public fund balances. Our total cost of deposits
at 72 basis points is well below peers, and we maintained our deposit pricing discipline with a low 15% total
deposit beta cycle to-date. Granularity is one of the keys to success here and Brendon will share some additional
details on the competitive advantage our funding base provides later in the deck.
With respect to liquidity, as you'd expect, we took steps to increase our cash on hand and our available liquidity
over the course of March and April. Our liquidity coverage in excess of our uninsured deposits is 150%, including
unencumbered assets. Likewise, our credit remains strong, with 5 basis points of non-PCD-related charge-offs
and stable asset quality. We remain watchful, like other banks, and are focused on potential pockets of softness.
Like our deposit portfolio, our loan portfolio is granular, which should continue to serve us well.
We remain confident in our client selection and underwriting. And as you know, Old National has taken an active
approach to credit management. This approach has served us well in various economic cycles. As evidenced this
quarter, we worked aggressively to address some PCD credit from the merger.
On the client side, engagement remained high in the quarter, and we continue to expect disciplined loan growth in
2023, albeit not at 2022's pace. In other areas, more the same, the low peer deposit costs should drive a funding
advantage, more organic growth of our wealth management client base, and a continued focus on disciplined
expense management. Thank you.
I will now turn the call over to Brendon to cover the quarter results in more detail.

Thanks, Jim. Turning to the quarter's results on slide 5. We reported GAAP net income applicable to common
shares of $143 million or $0.49 per share. Reported earnings include $15 million in pre-tax merger-related
charges, $1 million in pre-tax property optimization charges, as well as $5 million in debt securities losses.
Excluding these items, our adjusted earnings per share was $0.54.
Slide 6 provides our quarter-end balance sheet. Total asset growth of $1.1 billion in the quarter was driven by
disciplined loan growth and higher cash balances, funded through stable deposits and higher borrowings.
Moving to slide 7. Total deposits were stable quarter-over-quarter, despite public fund outflows. Q1 is typically our
seasonal low point for public funds, and we anticipate net inflows in Q2. Our trend in average deposits reflect mix

shift away from noninterest-bearing accounts into money market and CDs, which is typical for this point in the rate
cycle.
Market conditions continue to put upward pressure on deposit rates with total deposit costs up 38 basis points
quarter-over-quarter to a still very low 72 basis points, which equates to a total deposit cost beta of 15%. Interest-
bearing deposit costs increased 57 basis points to 1.09%, resulting in an interest-bearing deposit beta of 23%.
Although the terminal beta is difficult to estimate, we have a strong track record of managing deposit costs and
are confident we can maintain our funding advantage throughout the remainder of the rate cycle.
We are actively defending deposit balances through competitive rack rates and limited pricing exceptions in
addition to playing offense through various deposit specials. We are pleased with the execution of this strategy to-
date as we have been able to generate new deposits sufficient to maintain stable overall balances.
Slide 8 provides additional details and granularity of our deposit base. Our average core deposit account
balances are meaningfully lower than peers. We have deep and long-standing relationships with our deposit
customers, 75% of which have been with the bank for more than five years, and nearly a third have been with us
for more than 25 years. The concentration of our largest customers is also exceptionally low. Our top 20 deposit
clients represent less than 5% of our total deposits. If you exclude collateralized deposits, our top 20 represents
only 2% of our total deposits.
Slide 9 provides details of our funding and liquidity. We have ample liquidity with approximately 150% coverage of
our uninsured deposits, including $10.3 billion in immediately available funds from cash equivalents, Federal
Home Loan Bank, Fed discount window and the BTFP. We also have $5.4 billion in capacity from high-quality
unencumbered collateral available for pledging. Beyond the 150% coverage, we have significant other sources of
liquidity through broker deposits and unsecured credit lines, as well as insured cash sweep product capacity.
Slide 10 shows trend in total loan growth and portfolio yields. Total loans grew 2%, consistent with our
expectations and Q4 pipeline. Consumer loans were stable quarter-over-quarter, and loan portfolio yields
increased 34 basis points to 5.42%. The investment portfolio was stable quarter-over-quarter as portfolio cash
flows were offset by an improvement in fair values. Duration improved to 4.4, and we expect approximately $1.2
billion in total investment cash flows over the next 12 months.
Nearly, 80% of our portfolio consists of high-quality treasury and agency investments, with an additional 18% held
in highly rated municipals. The remaining portfolio consists of highly rated corporate securities and other
investments.
Slide 11 details our Q1 commercial production. The $1.8 billion of production was well-balanced across all
product lines and major markets. We continue to maintain a disciplined approach to underwriting, while taking
advantage of market dislocation to grow attractive new relationships. That said, we have tightened our pricing
standards, enhanced credit structure and have reinforced with our relationship managers the importance of
acquiring a full banking relationship for new loan requests.
Turning briefly to pricing. New money yields on commercial loans increased 64 basis points to 6.72% for the
quarter, with March production yields of 6.87%.
Moving to slide 12, you will see further details of our loan portfolio. We have a well-diversified commercial loan
portfolio that represents approximately 70% of total loans and carries an average loan balance of approximately
$1 million. Our nonowner-occupied CRE is well-diversified by asset class and geography. As it relates specifically

to nonowner-occupied office, the bulk of the portfolio is made up of suburban or medical office with a meaningful
amount of credit tenant leases. Less than 1% of total loans are located within central business districts, which are
geographically diverse in 11 Midwestern cities, with only five deals totaling less than $50 million in Chicago and
Minneapolis-Saint Paul.
Slide 13 shows our credit trends. Credit conditions are stable and our commercial and consumer portfolios
continue to perform exceptionally well. Delinquencies and NPLs are showing positive trends and net charge-offs
were stable at a modest 5 basis points, excluding the 16-basis point impact from PCD loans. Our special asset
team is continuing to work through the FNB-acquired PCD loan book and expect charge-offs from this portfolio to
be elevated in the near-term. The provision expense impact on the workout effort should be minimal as we carry
$54 million or approximately 5% reserve against this book.
On slide 14, you will see details of our first quarter allowance, including reserve for unfunded commitments, which
stands at $333 million, consistent with Q4. Reserves reflect loan growth with relatively small increases due to
portfolio mix, more than offset by improvement in economic forecast and charge-offs of PCD loans that don't
require reserve replenishment.
The financial health of our clients remains strong, and while credit metrics are stable, we believe it is prudent to
maintain elevated reserves, given the uncertainty in our economic outlook. Our current reserves reflect a 100%-
weighted Moody's S3 scenario with negative GDP of 3.1% and unemployment of 7.1%. Unless the economic
outlook deteriorates materially, 2023 provision expense should continue to be limited to portfolio performance and
loan growth. In addition to the $333 million in reserves, we also carry $96 million in acquired loan discount marks.
Next, on slide 15, you will see details of our net interest income and margin. Both metrics were generally in line
with our expectations. Net interest margin contracted 16 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 3.69%, while core
margin excluding accretion decreased 13 basis points to 3.62%. Core margin was just shy of the low end of our
margin guidance due to holding more cash on hand following market disruption in March. We continue to
proactively manage the balance sheet towards a neutral rate risk position, while layering in protection for a
sudden reversal in Fed rate policy.
Slide 16 shows trends in adjusted noninterest income, which was $76 million for the quarter. Again, this was
generally in line with our expectations, with improvement in capital markets and wealth revenues, offsetting
macro-driven weakness in mortgage and a full quarter impact of our service charge enhancement put in place in
December. The linked quarter increase in our other category was driven by fair market value adjustments on
equity securities and higher BOLI income.
Next, slide 17 shows the trend in adjusted noninterest expenses. Adjusted noninterest expense was $235 million
and our adjusted efficiency ratio was a low 48.8%. Expenses were well-controlled and consistent with the prior
quarter. The increase in the other expense category was largely due to higher FDIC assessment and marketing
expenses.
Slide 18 provides details on our capital position at quarter-end. Capital ratios were stable and reflect strong
earnings, offset by loan growth and share repurchases in the quarter. Our TCE ratio increased 19 basis points to
6.37%, largely due to a reduction in unrealized losses in other comprehensive income. Total available-for-sale
unrealized losses is impacting our TCE ratio by 145 basis points. Our after-tax HTM unrealized losses stood at
approximately $300 million at quarter-end.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2023
We continue to monitor our balance sheet for economic stress and feel very comfortable with our capital levels.
While we did repurchase 1.8 million shares of common stock earlier in the quarter, we do not anticipate
repurchasing additional shares in the near term.
As I wrap up my comments, here are some key takeaways. We had a strong start to 2023 with results in line with
our expectations. We posted strong return metrics with adjusted return on average assets of 1.39% and adjusted
return on tangible common equity of 23%. Our deposit franchise continues to perform exceptionally well in this
environment as we have maintained stability in our deposit balances while delivering a top-quartile total deposit
beta of 15%. We have ample liquidity with uninsured deposit coverage ratio of approximately 150%, including
unencumbered eligible collateral. Credit remains strong and we continue to manage expenses in a disciplined
manner as evidenced by our efficiency ratio of 48.8% for the quarter.
Slide 19 includes thoughts on our outlook for the remainder of 2023. We believe our current pipeline should
continue to support near-term loan growth in the mid-single-digit range. While we expect to have meaningful year-
over-year NII growth in 2023 in the range of 9% to 12%, margin will continue to be under pressure from higher
deposit costs.
More detailed NII and margin guidance is difficult to provide, given the uncertainty of future Fed rate actions and
the uncertainty of market dynamics that will ultimately determine terminal deposit betas. That said, we remain
confident in our ability to manage deposit costs better than most. Contractual accretion is expected be
approximately $16 million for the remainder of full year 2023.
We expect our fee businesses to continue to perform well despite headwinds with mortgage following industry
patterns. We should continue to see revenue momentum in wealth from the strategic hires we've made over the
last two years. Capital markets revenues will largely follow loan demand and should perform consistent with Q1
levels. This quarter's bank fees fully reflect the HSA sale and service charge enhancements implemented in
December and should represent a good baseline.
Our expense outlook is consistent with our prior guidance with full year 2023 total expense of approximately $939
million, excluding merger-related charges and property optimization-related expenses. Provision expense should
continue to be limited to loan growth, portfolio changes and non-PCD charge-offs as we believe we have
adequate reserve against the PCD book and we are already 100% weighted towards the Moody's S3 scenario.
Turning to taxes. We expect approximately $11 million in tax credit amortization for the remainder of 2023, with a
corresponding full year effective tax rate of 24% on a core FTE basis and 22% on a GAAP basis.
With those comments, I'd like to open the call for your questions. And we do have the full team available,
including Mark Sander, Jim Sandgren and John Moran.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper
Sandler. You may now proceed.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the questions. And my condolences regarding the events of the last
couple of weeks.

James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Thanks, Scott.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I was hoping we could start maybe on the sort of thoughts on deposit mix. What would be your best guess as to
where noninterest bearing levels go as a percent of total deposits, maybe a little historical perspective? And why
whatever numbers you think might be the best one where you sort of think things will settle?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, Scott. This is Brendon. Yeah, we look back – I think the 28% kind of pre-COVID level is probably a decent
[indiscernible] (00:18:04) in terms of where [indiscernible] (00:18:06). How long it takes to get there at this pace?
I'm not sure. But that's probably a good place to think about where it might settle.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. And then when you made some comments about having worked aggressively on some PCD stuff
from the merger, and it sounds like we'll continue to see some charge-offs there, albeit not ones that will require
provisioning since you already have that PCD reserve. But maybe just some thoughts on what kind of stuff you
are working through? How long it might take to work through the remainder of where'd you see issues, et cetera?

We still have $54 million of PCD reserves on our books. And so, I think that'll work through over the next 18 to 24
months, we would say. And I don't think it'll be a linear type of thing, so there'll be some lumpiness in there. But as
you indicated and as Brendon said, we think we're fully reserved on all those loans.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Hey. Good morning.

Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
I just want to take a moment, you guys did a fantastic job as both management team and as a franchise to
support the community. The last thing I know is – the last thing you guys want to do is make it about yourself, but I
think it's [ph] a plotted (00:19:40) tragedy. So you guys did a great job stepping up being a community bank and
supporting community far beyond loans and deposits.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Thank you. We appreciate your support.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
So in terms of kind of just – yeah, absolutely. In terms of just kind of growth going forward, I think it makes sense
that it's a little bit softer. I mean, obviously, the economic outlook isn't great. But when you guys think of kind of
new loans, any sort of subcategories within lending or within the loan portfolio that you guys are kind of targeting
as like this an area that we could still see some growth or positive risk-adjusted returns in any sort of geographies
that might entail?

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2023
I wouldn't specify any geographies, Ben, but C&I remains relatively strong, I would say. We've seen a lot of C&I
clients over the last quarter, and they remain positive. Slightly more muted than a few quarters ago, given rates
and noise relative to recession, but still positive outlook overall in C&I, generally speaking. Strong operating
performance and they're still looking to invest. So I think the C&I space still looks solid, albeit at a lower level than
we saw in 2022.
In CRE, certainly, volumes are down, but you still have a couple of sectors, multifamily and industrial, which is
where we do the vast majority of our new business these days, which are holding up well. We're not seeing major
rent increases, but they're still seeing modest rent increases off of really strong bases. So you still have pockets of
strength out there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
That's great to hear. And then I know you guys have done a pretty sizable rebranding and adjustment, and
frankly, highlighting wealth management. Do you still think that there's a lot of additional hires? Is that kind of
embedded? Or are we still kind of refining somewhat of a run rate? I mean, obviously, market dependent helps
assets under management. I'm just trying to think from a fee income perspective. It seems like you guys are
growing faster than peers, but you're clearly investing there, too. So just trying to see the dynamics within that
subcategory.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Maybe I can start, Ben, and Mark can chime in. But first, the new hires are embedded in our outlook on the
expense guide. So a lot of that would include additional wealth hires. And I know we're still seeing a lot of talent
and having a lot of [indiscernible] (00:22:15) continue to invest [indiscernible] (00:22:17). And I do think the
momentum you've seen over the last couple of quarters in this space, we're hopeful that can continue, absent
market dynamics that may be a bit of a headwind there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
I think the story here is similar to what we said relative to the total growth, right? I think we still see opportunities
at a lower level of new hires in 2023 than we saw in 2022, but we'll still hire. We hired eight revenue producers
across wealth and commercial in Q1. Again, I think you'll continue – there's still markets we'd like to build out
further. And we still – we invest for the long haul. And so, we're a franchise that people want to join and we still
are – think they are a nice – we think people who are high performers pay for themselves quickly. We never tire of
saying that to people. And I think we're going to – you'll continue to see a steady stream, albeit at a lower level of
new hires in 2023.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. And first off, Jim, I also want to share my ongoing support for you and the Old National team.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Thanks, Terry. It means an awful lot.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And then just a couple of questions here. Brendon, I recognize and appreciate the predicting and forecasting
deposit betas. Tough to really estimate. But when you look at your NII guide of 9% to 12%, is there a deposit beta
range or some underlying assumptions that you're willing to share within the outlook for full year NII?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Sure. As you said, this is a tough environment, but we did want to at least put some guardrails out there. So what
we did is we modeled both the forward curve, which implies kind of 2.5 cuts in the back half of the year. And then
something more consistent with the Fed dot plot, which is 1 more and flat. And then we looked at a range of betas
from 30% to 40% cumulative by the end of the year, and that's kind of where the range of possibilities came out.
As we looked at that and tried to probability weight it, we have a bias towards the higher end of that range, but it's
just difficult to pinpoint with any more precision than that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks. And then maybe as a follow-up, any comments with regards to deposit trends in metro versus community
markets? And how they've differed over the last several quarters at all?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
There really hasn't been a big difference. We have one market in particular, one state that has typically had a
higher beta than others. But generally, fairly, fairly consistent across the footprint.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
And we have slightly different pricing parameters across markets, and so to reflect some of those regional
differences. But yeah, the performance has been stable across the entire footprint.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And then one last quick one. The debt security loss, was that an investment in one of the banks that failed last

Great. Good morning. Like everyone else, I extend our condolences to the ONB family. Jim, the – or maybe a
question for Brendon. The $1.2 billion that's going to come off the bond book over the next year would effectively
map to one for one on your loan growth. So I guess, is that the way you're thinking kind of flat at earning assets
from here?

Yeah. I'd point you back to the kind of year-over-year guide that we just – we talked about. Clearly, there'll be
pressure on the margin embedded in the year-over-year increase. And just it's really difficult to, again, say where
that thing is going to land. But in terms of the down rate protection, we continue to be really active on that spot
and continue to put pressure – I mean, put additional protection there. And obviously, as deposit costs continue to
increase, we get closer and closer to a neutral risk rate position, which is what we're trying to move towards over
the next couple of quarters.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2023
And in terms of just broader balance sheet management, is there anything that might be on the table given the
environment's gotten a little bit more challenging? And also, can you remind us where you'd be comfortable letting
the loan to deposit adrift?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. So obviously, we're – this is a – it's a dynamic environment. All tools are on the table, both off-balance
sheet and on-balance sheet opportunities to preserve margin and protect capital. So we'll continue to look at all
opportunities. But we don't see anything big or major restructurings in the future. And we think we have room to
grow on the loan deposit ratio. We have ample liquidity. And we still have – we have levers to continue to let
some of the noncore consumer books shrink to support higher and better quality commercial growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then, Jim, maybe one for you. You noted the buyback. I assume that happened before March
9th.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Correct.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I guess what would it take to either turn it back on or perhaps consider something external with your capital?
Typically, you guys have been pretty disciplined and when you see things. But there's a lot of volatility and there
likely could be some opportunities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Obviously, more stability for a longer period of time, I think, is what's going to require for us to get more
comfortable in looking at capital differently. Getting more clarity as the year plays out with respect to the economy,
I think, is also going to be critical. We're in no hurry to do much different with our capital. We're just going to
continue to watch how the year plays out. And if it plays out where it's a little bit better than everybody anticipates,
I think we could be thinking about capital in the future. But until then, we just got to sit on the sidelines and watch
things play.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. Great. Thank you.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2023
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, everyone. Again, like everybody else, just want to say I'm terribly sorry about what
happened. That's very tragic.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Thank you, Brody.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah. As to some of the noninterest-bearing deposits, just wanted to ask if there's any geographic concentration
as to where that runoff occurred within your footprint? And any thoughts you can offer on expectations from here?
I think Scott asked something about it earlier, but I might have missed it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yes. Sure. I can tell. No geographic concentration. Clearly, it was – it's mostly on the commercial side
[indiscernible] (00:30:04) higher percentages of noninterest-bearing deposits in total. And we had talked about
pre-COVID, we were at a low point, about 28% on interest-bearing deposits, and that might be a good way to
think about a potential floor.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Understood. And then I did want to just circle back on the assumptions in the allowance that the 7.1%
unemployment, is that like a 2024 number? Like, just give me a timeframe on that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. I can't remember specifically the quarter that that peaks, but that is the peak unemployment in the Moody's
S3 scenario.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
We can get – we follow back up with you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah, that'd be great. Could you just – I want to circle back on the data commentary. I think you responded to
Terry's question maybe on NII. You said a 30% to 40% beta is what you ran through when you did the different
scenarios. I'm assuming the 40% is maybe in the flat scenario using the dot plots and the 30% is maybe closer if

we get Fed cuts. Is that a good way to think about it? And could you help us understand what the interest-bearing
beta is or if that was the interest-bearing beta that you were talking about?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
That is the interest-bearing beta. We ran all of those beta assumptions through both curves. But to your point,
obviously, we'd expect probably a lower beta in the forward curve where there's cuts, higher beta if it's higher for
longer, which is where we're [indiscernible] (00:31:41) leaning towards probably the higher end or are biased
towards the higher end of that range as we look through it. It's probably unlikely we have the highest beta in a
down or a rate-cutting environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Could you remind me – could you remind us what percentage of the loan portfolio is floating rate? And then
give us a sense for what the fixed rate loans that you need to reprice over the rest of the year look like?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yes. We are sitting at 56% floating today. And the duration of our loan book is roughly five years. So you'll see
about 20% of our fixed rate loans reprice meaningfully higher.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And we – are we done with the hedging or is there additional hedging that is going to take place on the
loan side?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
No. We'll continue to look for opportunities, like I said, both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet to continue
layer in downward protection and protect margin. And we're not taking our eye off the ball of OCI and capital. So
we'll – there are some opportunities to do there to protect that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And then last one for me was just if you happen to have the assets under management at quarter-end?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. It was $28 billion.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. So relatively flattish quarter-over-quarter?

Operator: Thank you, Mr. Preston. We have a follow-up question from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper
Sandler. You may now proceed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, everyone. Thank you for taking the question, just sort of a [ph] ticky-tacky (00:33:20) one. Within the 9% to
12% NII guidance – growth NII guidance, does that assume the contractual accretion or is there a different
number baked into there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
It's slightly higher than the contractual accretion number. It's kind of in that typical 20%, 30% range.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. That was actually it. So thank you very much.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2023
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Like the others, just deepest condolences to everyone impacted. I wanted to get to a couple of follow-ups here.
But you used the term limited pricing exceptions in terms of your deposit management. How much more frequent
is that today than, say, it was prior to mid-March?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
I don't know that it's picked up materially. It's been pretty steady since December. And I think if you look at the
average interest-bearing cost and sort of the spot rate differences 12/31 to 3/31, that pace hasn't really increased.
So I think it's indicative, it's pretty steady state
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
And we have competitive rack rates, as Brendon alluded to earlier, and some of the larger deposit balances,
we've got to them early. And so – but most of that has played its way out. I wouldn't say it's done, but I would say
the vast majority of the pricing exceptions is largely behind us because, again, the large balances, we're on it
quickly. We're also getting aggressive and on the offense where we – judiciously in our markets, right, where
we're opening more accounts than we're closing and raising balances across our footprint.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Do you guys – this seems like a crazy question. But have things really changed that much in terms of
deposit pricing since mid-March?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
Interesting question. Not really. Yeah, it's a great question. There's been a lot more conversations, but the actual
pricing hasn't changed dramatically since mid-March.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. That was my sense, but I thought I should ask. A couple more things here. You're talking about your
relationship managers and the focus on the full banking relationship. Is that something that's different that's now
expected from your borrowers and your relationship managers? Or does that change or restrict any opportunities
for you, just you're talking about the tightened pricing structure, enhanced credit structure and kind of chasing
deposits as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
I really appreciate that question because the answer is, no. I mean, that's our model, right? It's a relationship-
based model. And we lend to people that bank with us. In times like this, you can be more adamant and forceful
and disciplined and – but I'd like to think candidly that we always are. And I think in general we are. But this is a
place where you draw a line in the sand a little bit more and make sure that that's the case.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2023
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And then just last one. This is a follow-up on Brody's question. The S3 Moody's weighting is – it's obviously
pretty severe. Are you guys more concerned today about credit than you were a quarter ago? And if there's a
degree of whether you're more concerned or not, you haven't changed your views at all? And then what happens
if that S3 is just way off and it doesn't come true and we end up in a much better spot than that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Jon, let me take the top of that. I don't think we're meaningfully more concerned about credit today than we were
heading into really all of last year and into this year. Obviously, we're not immune from hearing about what's going
on in the economy. And – but as Mark said, we spent an awful lot of time with clients. And when we're out with
clients, we're just not hearing that same kind of feedback that seems to be discussed in today's news cycle.
Having said that, we think it's prudent and have had that opinion for quite some time.
I guess the question gets back to maybe more of an accounting question about when do we think about a
different forecast to run through there or not? Brendon, I don't know what else you'd add to that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
No. Obviously, I think there'll be a time where whatever recession may or may not be coming hits, we're going to
– we'll have to think about a different weighting for the Moody's S3. And that would imply some opportunity for
potential reserve release depending on what the environment looks like.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Mark continues to lead us through portfolio reviews and making sure that we're going through and doing deep
dives on the entire book and particularly those areas that are generally more vulnerable. We're going to continue
to do that, look for – we have an active/proactive management that we've always been known for. And if we
identify weaknesses, we're going to put them in the hospital quickly with the hope that they come out healthy
again. And we're just going to continue to do that. And that's – we're probably a little bit more sensitive to that
today than we were maybe six months ago, but that's absolutely the approach that we've always taken in these
kinds of times.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. All right. Well, nice job. Nice quarter.
