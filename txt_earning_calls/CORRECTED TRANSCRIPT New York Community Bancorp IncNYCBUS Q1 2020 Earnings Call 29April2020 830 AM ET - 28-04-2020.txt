Joseph R. Ficalora
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast and thank you for joining us today. I hope that all of
you are healthy and safe during this unprecedented time. Our immediate thoughts go out to all the individuals and
communities impacted by this pandemic. We are also very grateful for the healthcare professionals and all those
on the frontlines who are battling this crisis every day.
Before I discuss this quarter's performance, I would like to cover topics with you, these two topics. First, I would
like to share with you some of the actions we have taken across the bank to deal with COVID-19 crisis. It goes
without saying that the health and well-being of our employees, customers and shareholders is of the utmost
importance to management and the Board of Directors. The company was very proactive during the very early
stages of the crisis, and immediately enacted a business continuity plan and pandemic preparedness procedures.
By mid-March, close to 100% of our bank office employees were working remotely. In addition, we temporarily
closed all of our in-store branches along with several other locations converted some to drive-up only and
adjusted the hours at our remaining branches.
On the consumer side, we have enhanced our online banking and mobile capabilities, temporarily waive certain
retail banking fees for those customers who may be experiencing financial difficulties during this time and offered
90-day payment forbearance to residential mortgage customers.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2020
On the commercial side, we have proactively reached out to borrowers on a case-by-case basis to help them
manage through this crisis as well. We put in place several risk mitigation strategies including enhanced
monitoring of certain credit payment restructuring plans and deferral options consistent with regulatory guidance.
Second, I would like to clear up some misperceptions regarding trends in the rent-regulated multi-family market in
New York City. We are not a newcomer to this market. If you recall, at this point, we have been doing this type of
lending for over 50 years. We have relationships with some of the largest property owners in the city, and we
have very strong ties to some of the biggest commercial real estate brokers including the largest one servicing the
New York City marketplace.
We also have a – as directors, several real estate professionals who participate in this market for a living,
providing us with a unique perspective on the multi-family market. Over the past week or so, there has been some
discussions about the level of rent collections in our market. With our conservative view on underwriting, we
closely monitor a number of trends in the multi-family market. And when things change, we re-evaluate.
During the month of April, we surveyed a wide gamut of our borrowers including some of our top 20 borrowers.
We spoke to brokers and we also reached out to a number of industry experts. Based on our market intelligence,
April rent collections on the rent-regulated buildings in our portfolio are estimated to be in a range of 80% to 85%.
On the market rent properties, it is even higher. This is very encouraging given the impact on the New York City
area given the COVID-19 pandemic. While there are still many uncertainties regarding how COVID-19 crisis will
ultimately unfold, to what degree it will impact the economy over the long run, we believe that we are better
positioned than most other financial institutions to navigate through it given our strong credit culture and low
operating model.
While no two economic cycles are alike, I would impress upon you the fact that throughout various cycles our
actual loan loss experience has been much lower than the rest of the industry. With that out of the way, let's turn
to our quarterly results. Earlier this morning, we reported diluted earnings per common share of $0.20 for the
three months ended March 31, 2020. That's up 5% compared to the year-ago quarter and ahead of consensus
estimates.
Despite what is usually a seasonally slower quarter, we had strong loan growth, a higher level of net interest
income and net interest margin expansion, lower operating expenses and stable asset quality metrics. We
enacted the first quarter with positive underlying momentum, and we are a strong capital and liquidity position.
Our results include a provision for credit losses of $21 million. That's 0.05%, far below industry metrics due to the
application of CECL during the quarter. This reflects an additional reserve for the potential impact of COVID-19.
This was slightly offset by an income tax benefit due to certain provisions under the CARES Act.
That notwithstanding, we are very pleased with our first quarter performance. We entered the year with strong
fundamentals building off of a solid performance in the fourth quarter of last year. One of the highlights of the
quarter is the improvement in both net interest income and the margin. After reaching an inflection point last
quarter when these two metrics both increased for the first time in five years, they increased again during the
quarter – the current quarter.
Net interest income excluding the impact of prepayment activity increased $9.3 million, or 17% on an annualized
basis compared to the previous quarter due to lower interest expense as funding cost continued to decline. The

net interest margin also continued its upward trajectory. Also excluding the impact from prepayment income, the
first quarter margin would have been 1.92%, up 2 basis points and in line with expectations.
We are currently very well-positioned for further growth throughout 2020 in both the margin and net interest
income albeit at a higher rate than we experienced during the current quarter. This is due to our liability-sensitive
balance sheet, the Fed having lowered its target rate to near zero and the significant re-pricing opportunities
embedded within our funding mix especially on the CD side. We also reported a strong increase in pre-provision
net revenue. PPNR was $135.8 million for the first quarter, up $8.5 million or 6% compared to the year-ago
quarter. On the expense front, total non-interest expense was $125.5 million, down 10% from a year-ago quarter.
The efficiency ratio in the first quarter was 48% and continues to reflect positive operating leverage.
Moving on to the balance sheet, despite the usual beginning-of-year's seasonality, Federal loans increased
almost $400 million or 4% on an annualized basis compared to the fourth quarter. Specialty finance lending and
multi-family portfolio continue to be the primary drivers of this growth.
The specialty finance business had strong growth this quarter. This portfolio rose $415 million to $3 billion on a
linked-quarter basis. Meanwhile, the multi-family portfolio increased $113 million to $31.3 billion sequentially. As I
alluded to earlier, given all that has transpired over the last two months, multi-family credit spreads have widened
significantly due to market dislocation and less competition similar to what has occurred in previous cycles.
Origination activity was also strong as overall originations increased 35% on a year-over-year basis to $2.7 billion
with both multi-family and specialty finance originations increasing significantly compared to the year-ago quarter.
First quarter originations exceeded last quarter's pipeline by $1.2 billion or 80%. Multi-family originations were
$1.4 billion and specialty finance originations were $957 million, both up 40% relative to first quarter of last year.
We continue to be encouraged by our potential loan growth over the course of this year. Our pipeline currently
stands at $2.1 billion, 40% higher than the fourth quarter and year-ago pipeline. Of the $2.1 billion, approximately
64% is new money.
On the funding side, our deposit growth continued into the first quarter as well. Total deposits rose $316 million or
4% annualized to $32 billion. Most of this growth was in lower cost savings and non-interest-bearing checking
accounts, while of CDs declined modestly. Wholesale borrowings also increased as we took advantage of the low
interest rate environment to replace matured borrowings with lower cost, longer duration borrowings.
Borrowings increased $375 million to $14.3 billion during the current quarter. On the asset quality side, as
discussed in more detail in our earnings release, we reported a $21 million provision for credit losses mainly
driven by COVID-19. Net charge-offs totaled $10 million or 0.02% of average loans, $6.5 million of which was taxi
medallion-related loans. That portfolio continues to be in runoff mode and currently stands at $33.5 million.
Importantly, we had no losses in our core portfolio.
The adoption of CECL did not have a material impact on our asset quality metrics as they remained strong during
the quarter. Non-performing assets declined $15 million or 20% to $59 million compared to the level at year end
or 11 basis points of total assets. As with charge-offs, the largest component of NPAs is taxi medallion loans.
Excluding taxi medallion-related loans, NPAs would have been $36 million or 7 basis points of total assets.
As noted in today's investor presentation, $18.7 billion or 60% of our total multi-family portfolio is subject to New
York State rent regulation laws. The weighted average LTV on this piece of the portfolio is 53% compared to 57%
for the overall multi-family portfolio unchanged from the previous quarter.

Lastly, we also announced that the Board of Directors declared a $0.17 cash dividend per common share for the
quarter. The dividend will be payable on May 19 to common shareholders of record as of May 9. Based on
yesterday's closing price, this represents an annualized dividend yield of 6.6%.
Before moving on to your questions, I would like to make a final comment. At NYCB, we are not just a community
bank, we are a family and when things get difficult our family comes together. I am extremely proud of all the
efforts everyone – every employee has made to ensure that we continue to service our customers. This has been
a very challenging, stressful period for everyone and I am proud at how the entire organization has come together
and risen to the challenge. A very big collective thank you to all of our 3,000 employees throughout our franchise.
Lastly, our prayers go out to all those members of the NYCB family past and present who are suffering from
COVID-19 and particularly those employees, their families and friends who have lost due to disease.
On that note, I would now ask the operator to open the line for your questions. We will do our best to get to all of
you within the remaining time. But if we don't, please feel free to call us later today or this week.

America. Please proceed.

Morning, Ebrahim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities, Inc.
Good morning, everyone. So, I guess just to follow up your comments about the multi-family [indiscernible]
(00:18:00) I guess my sense is we'll probably see an uptick in rent deferrals when we look at the May 1 week
data. So those numbers probably go from 80% to 85% to something lower. So, would love to get your thoughts on
that. And additionally if you can talk about the strength of your customer base. Given as the LTV is in the low 50s,
what's the risk in terms of – from a credit standpoint to NYB and what level of payment deferrals have you
provided to your clients in the last month or so?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph R. Ficalora A

Yeah, sure. So Ebrahim, good morning. It's Tom Cangemi. Joe can address the market, but I'll clearly give you
the specifics on what we've done with our customers. We were very quick to react to obviously this pandemic
[indiscernible] (00:18:46) to support the customer base. So we offered right out of the – in mid-March when the
government shut down the country, the ability for customers to come to us and defer for a period of four – six

months, and part of that deferral was they have to be current at the time they've entered into a deferral agreement
and they have to be also paying their escrow payments throughout that period. That being said, we – actually as
of yesterday, which is [indiscernible] (00:19:14) May, we have approximately $3 billion of multi or 9.63% of the
entire multi portfolio that's in a deferral agreement.
If you think about the entire portfolio and add to it CRE, it's approximately $4.8 billion and the CRE piece of that I
believe is approximately $1.8 billion. In total, percentage of the CRE is approximately 26%. So all-in, it's about
12.6% of multi-family CRE of $4.8 billion and the LTV of that portfolio that's on deferral is 57%.

And...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A

And that's as of yesterday, so that's in a real-time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities, Inc.
And it's a 90-day deferral to loan. Like what is – like is your expectation...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
That's a 6-month deferral.
[indiscernible] (00:20:02)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities, Inc.
And if we start seeing these lockdowns kind of open up, let's call it somewhere around in June, July, is your sense
that most of these borrowers or all of these borrowers will go back to being current coming looking out into third
quarter towards the end of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, Ebrahim, I don't have a crystal ball, but I can give you actual specific collections as of yesterday. We're
looking at – when you take into account the deferrals as well as people that have [indiscernible] (00:20:28) up to
97.70% of April collections compared to all of the previous months around the same level. When you back out
deferral, so the multi-family, that's at 91% versus 97%. So we're really not seeing a significant adjustment here on
payment – on payments coming through. So we're very pleased on the current collection effort that is going on as
of yesterday.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities, Inc.
Understood. And just moving away from multi-family to anything – when you look at the other CRE book, I think
CRE retail is obviously under the scanner or just talk to us in terms of the risk exposure there particularly to any

more retail high end and also if any risk on the specialty finance book which has grown a lot over the last couple
of years?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Sure. So obviously the percentage of deferral is higher for commercial real estate in particular looking at retail and
office and alike. So we expected that especially on the mixed use properties [indiscernible] (00:21:22) the highest
percentage will be the mixed use properties where you have smaller buildings that have a higher concentration of
retail on the ground floor and you have residential above that. That number is in – probably in the 40 percentile.
When you think about pure – we'll call it pure retail and office, 23% for office and professional buildings and retail
is at 27%. When you blend that – those numbers in for the portfolio, it's 26%. But clearly, the higher level is going
to be as expected, there's no revenue coming in in the ground floor.
On the multi side, we happen to have some very interesting statistics. The larger the buildings, the much lower
the amount of deferral. So the buildings that have in excess of 100-plus families living in the building, that's like a
6% deferral rate. So it's much lower. So it's 6% type versus the retail which is – could be substantially higher
because there's no revenue coming through.
On specialty finance, I would tell you that as we stand right now, everything is current and no missed payments.
We feel pretty confident on the portfolio given our senior security and our position. And we've been growing that
portfolio very nicely. And again, we're an asset-based lender. We feel that we don't have significant exposure
that's COVID related. We do have some energy, couple hundred million dollars in energy, but that's all super
senior secured to very stable institutions.
And on the auto side, which is dealer floor plan, we believe that portfolio will do well given the PPP program as
well as the ability to get up and running towards the end of the year with the – with their option to take on deferrals
and eventually get these dealerships open up again. So we think that that portfolio we should have zero losses in
the specialty finance business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities, Inc.
Got it. That's helpful. And just one separately and last one on the margin. So you have a ton of, like, funding
coming up for refi. Just talk to us in terms of the new deposit rates offered and if you can provide some cadence
of the interest rate backdrop if it stays where it is given the spread widening on the lending side, like what level of
margin expansion should we expect between now [indiscernible] (00:23:21) quarter or if you can talk to just the
next few quarters like what is the level of margin we expect to the end 2020?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Sure. Sure. So I'd say, big picture, as we talked about, going back to 2019, we said there's an inflection point in
the fourth quarter, the margins start to rise in Q4 with the anticipation seeing significant rise as we go into 2020
with the exception of a substantial adjustments in interest rates. Obviously, the Fed has intervened here
[indiscernible] (00:23:47) close to a near zero Fed fund rate.
With that being said, we did hit our guidance for Q1 as expected up to, but when you think about second quarter
margin, we'll see more likely than not double-digit margin expansion. We believe that throughout 2020, we
anticipate double digit every quarter. So, we're going to have substantial margin expansion given our liability

sensitivity balance sheet, and more importantly we have substantial amount of CDs coming due as you can see
from the press release. We put the numbers out there. It's approximately $14.8 billion coming due. In the second
quarter, it's $6 billion coming due at a 2.35%.
And in the event that you have a CD rolling off in this environment, you're going to end up in a probably more
likely than not a level well below 50 basis points. So, I think, when you think about the potential there, $6 billion in
Q2, Q3 is almost $5 billion at 2.06%. These rates are coming down well below 1%. So, the margin is really going
to be driven by a number of factors. We have the CD cost dropping materially. Funding cost is dropping on the
borrowings side. If you look at where borrowings are right now on two-year bullets at 74 basis points with a swap,
it's close to effectively zero. And you think about the money coming due on the borrowing side and if we're
growing the portfolio depending on how we grow with deposits and our borrowings, the cost is relatively cheap.
But more importantly, there's been a real change in pricing in respect to the multi-family CRE space. I mean no
question that there's been some dislocation with CMBS players are – on the sidelines. You have the agencies
tightening up their standards. So, we're looking at north of 300 basis points increase in our product mix. So, if you
were to come to the bank today [indiscernible] (00:25:26) an A-type credit five-year structure, our typical bread-
and-butter structure, you're at a 3.5% coupon. That's pretty attractive compared to where five-year treasuries are
trading at right now. So, we're very bullish about the economic spreads on the product mix. We're extremely
bullish on the drop in the cost of funds. So, we can see double-digit margin expansion every quarter throughout
2020 and that will be assuming credit costs are in [ph] shack (00:25:51) you're looking at EPS growth in the mid-
teens.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2020
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Could you kind of dive into the multi-family credit spreads? I think we all saw the dislocation in
March. It seemed like the GSEs kind of pulled themselves out of the market. Why doesn't this mean revert and
how much of that aggressive margin guide is based on the current pricing holding?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, again, we don't have a crystal ball what happens with interest rates, but clearly it seems like rates are going to
stay low for a while here given the pandemic and the circumstances. So we have in our run rate [indiscernible]
(00:26:58) we'll just talk about 2020, Fed not doing anything in 2020. At the same time, we've been through many
crisis and cycles and we've seen adjustments within the marketplace and clearly go back to the 2008 adjustment.
You had massive dislocation. You had CMBS. You had the agency out of business back then.
So, it's – it doesn't [indiscernible] (00:27:17) say that the agency is out of business but the agency has clearly
tightened their standards. They have widened their spreads. There is a premium risk-reward that's priced in the
marketplace and we're enjoying that healthier spread. I think what's most important here, when you talk about
asset growth, we're anticipating 5% net loan growth, but we're seeing substantial favorable results on retention as
we ended up the quarter. So as we go into Q2, we think our retention level will be higher and we have well over
13 – or $16 billion in next two years coming due from our own customer base. So, we believe we will retain a high
percentage of that unlike we did last year. So, I think the fact that the competition has waned significantly 300-
basis-point spread with funding costs coming down to zero, it can be a very powerful margin expansion story here
at NYCB.

Okay. And you were going through these numbers very quickly, could you just review again the CRE and multi-
family forbearance percentage?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Sure. $3 billion as of yesterday that we've entered into agreements on forbearance for multi-family, $1.8 billion for
CRE which is office and retail predominantly. On a percentage basis, that's 12.6% in total, 9.6% multi, 26.4% on
CRE. LTV in the total portfolio is 57% of that deferral.

On the loan growth here, just wanted to see, you're talking about a pretty strong pipeline here. Any thoughts – any
updated thoughts around total loan growth here for the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, Joe, do you want to handle that one, Joe?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph R. Ficalora A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I think the idea here is that as always is the case when the market is stressed, we get a greater share of the
market. We do believe that we'll be growing our loans at least at the levels of last year and well likely in excess of
the levels of last year. So, the important thing is that in this crisis, our principal asset will greatly outperform and
our ability to take share of the marketplace will increase. Both of those factors have always been the case in a
stressed environment. We do believe that the period ahead will represent an environment where many of the
other lenders in our niche will lend less and we will lend more.

...some color on our projections. Obviously, we're projecting in mid-single digits, which is 5%. We're pretty bullish
about the pipeline and more importantly going back to my dialogue, as far as retention, it feels like our team has
done a phenomenal job on really conveying that we're really fighting for that retention. So we moved that retention
rates back up to the historical norms. What typically will happen when a lot of competition is waning, we should
see the potential, as Joe indicated, of higher growth. But for conservative purposes, we feel comfortable that 5%
net loan growth is reasonable for the company. And I think this year you'll probably see more on the multi-family
side than – you'll still have strong growth on the specialty, but multi-family should be back-loaded here especially
in Q2. Obviously Q2 is usually a strong quarter for us.

Great. And then just in terms of underwriting standards here, any changes as you're getting new customers
approaching the bank?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So I would add that we have made some changes. Obviously given the marketplace we've tightened the
standards, in particular when cash money refi coming out of a transaction, we feel that we have a lot more
flexibility now given the marketplace. So we're actually – when we do a transaction with a cash-out type refi, we're
actually holding six months of both P&I and escrow payments, in escrow with the bank. So that's one of the major
changes we've done in this environment. And obviously you can imagine that when the environment gets tighter,
we're one of the tightest underwriters in the marketplace. So we're going to continue to be there for our
customers, but we're going to be there at a very conservative level and that's the hallmark of the company.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley FBR, Inc.
Great. And then on funding costs here, interest-bearing deposit costs down 12 basis points. I hear you in terms of
significant re-pricing. Just wondering if you could put a little bit more in terms of what you would expect this
quarter versus the first quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So I would say the continuation of substantial declines in deposit cost is real. We have a unique situation going, in
particular we're in the epicenter. So it's very difficult to go out to the branch and change your deposits when CDs
are coming due. So many people are just very comfortable for safety reasons keeping their cash in the bank. Now
that being said, that's – people that we're at 2.75% last year or 2.50% are going down to close to 2 basis points
today until they come back to the branch and – or make a phone call and try to get a higher rate. And my guess is
that given where the marketplace is, you're looking at rates [indiscernible] (00:32:31) probably be south of 50
basis points for between 1- or 2-year-type period.
We do have an offering now, but there's no real takers on that type of coupon at 75 to 90 basis points. But the
reality is we're going to be continuing lowering our rates unless there's a change in the market because we're
looking at close to 0% interest rates. And being a thrift, we're very stable when it comes to targeting some spread
off of the US Treasury which is at a very low rate. So we feel highly confident that the substantial amount of
coming due of $14.7 billion, in particular Q2 $6 billion in the middle of the epicenter at 2.35% will drop materially
lower for us.

We've been lending to them for multiple years since we started the business, and they've drawdown on some
facilities but it's all super senior secured and we have it at a pretty high rated on a scale. I think it's [indiscernible]
(00:33:42)? It's a high rated, internally classified asset. However, we feel highly confident that it's money good

and in particular it's a household name that has very strong fundamentals. And more importantly, it's super senior
secured. So it's not a loan to Schlumberger, the corporation, but it's on its equipment.

Good morning, Collyn.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn B. Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. First question, just on the pipeline, really strong pipeline obviously this
quarter. Do you have a sense of sort of how that's going to behave going into 2Q? Tom, I know you just
mentioned you expect strong loan growth in 2Q. But just curious kind of where you're – what your borrower
behavior is, how closings are getting done, so maybe what the pull through rate is on that pipeline and then also
what the blended rate is on that pipeline [indiscernible] (00:34:42)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So let me hit the easy one first. The blended rate's about 3.26% as of yesterday. But if you think about how it
evolved, when you go to the end of the quarter, spreads widen out materially. We started with the rent regulatory
changes in last year when we went from 150 to 200 basis points because of the change in the rent control market.
And then we hit the pandemic, now we're north of 300. So it really was a change in the marketplace towards the
backend of the quarter. So this is more of an evolving pipeline that we're going to see throughout the year. But the
business that we're out there getting good flows of opportunity right now within our own portfolio and others, as
you indicated, our new money pipeline is about 64%, you're seeing a much higher coupon relevant to the current
– the one I just cited at 3.25%, it's going to take some time to work through the bank. But clearly, we've never – I
don't think we've ever closed – last time what we've announced in our pipeline, I can't remember ever where we
announced the pipeline, we didn't close it at a minimum our pipeline. So we're looking at a $2.1 billion pipeline in
Q2. So [indiscernible] (00:35:44) close that and some.

Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
And Collyn, one thing I would say is the providers are assuming that the market reopens, right? This – we did this
– we had great closings in a very difficult environment where we had to get attorneys together, appraisers
together. We get actual appraisals. We're not – we are in the marketplace closing loans on a daily basis with all
these operational issues that are out there. Assuming that the country reopens, that only would be better for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn B. Gilbert Q

Okay. But your assumption that you close that pipeline, let's assume things don't open, certainly not New York

Thomas Robert Cangemi A

We went through a pretty...

originations.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn B. Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, okay. And then just on the amount that you deferred. You gave the 57% LTVs on those loans. You gave
what the debt service coverage is on that? On...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah, sure. The debt service cover is at 1.74 for the top – for the – that's the commercial real estate
portfolio and 1.53 for the multi.

I think what's interesting about the program, we were very active. And obviously it was publicized within one day
that we're doing this. So people when you read the real deal, it's public that we're doing this program and people
call and we offered it. And more importantly, we've done our own due diligence on each customer, right? And the
fact that you have to have your escrows current, you have to be current on the payment and we worked out a six-
month arrangement. We think that liquidity [indiscernible] (00:37:39) for them for the next six months, will be very
helpful to get to the other side of this problem we have with this pandemic in the United States. And we think that
six-month time should be reasonable. We could have gone a shorter period. We think six months is more
reasonable because it's going to take a few months here to get us in particular on the ground floor for businesses.
But we think it's a reasonable timeframe that we can at least have the landlords work it out with their tenants so
we can move forward and be there and be supportive of them given the crisis.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2020
Okay. Along those lines and you sort of answered it, but just broadly, right, so obviously sitting in unprecedented
times, your book has not been tested to this degree. I don't think – I wouldn't even say 9/11 tested it like it does
right now. How does that impact the way you're thinking about the reserves? I mean it was a modest reserve build
this quarter. Just kind of broadly, given the risks that are out there, how are you thinking about [indiscernible]
(00:38:32)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, Collyn, I'm going to actually defer the time tested to Joe Ficalora who has been with the bank well over 50
years. Joe, maybe you want to talk about the time tested as far as your experience in multiple decades more than
I have?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph R. Ficalora A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, I think the good news, we are structured such that this adverse change which of course was not anticipated
is not all that different than many other reasons why a market place deteriorates and payments are deferred or
otherwise evaporate. The environment we're in presents challenge, but none of this challenge actually changes
the reasonable expectations that our owners will in fact remain stable, our buildings will remain stable and much,
much more importantly, we cultivate relationships that are way bigger than isolated properties that are funded by
us. The very people that have each and every loan with us, in many cases, are extremely large players in the
New York market and they have long history with us and the opportunity that a deteriorating market represents.
And in every deteriorating market, the large players buy. And in every circumstance when they're buying in a
deteriorating market, we fund. There is a very big difference between having a relationship with us and having a
relationship with a giant bank or with another bank.
Many other banks literally vacate the space because they're experiencing so much adverse performance, they're
not willing to continue to lend within the space. We're not having adverse performance and we gained share
during periods of crisis. The period ahead will literally provide for us additional market share and that additional
market share will give us the ability to grow our book with good product and better than existing rates. The ability
for us to earn on our principal asset go forward is actually better than it has been for a long period of time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Look, Collyn, I'll address the reserve, [indiscernible] (00:41:02) good history of the bank, and obviously, he's been
here for many decades. As far as the reserve is concerned, assuming the COVID did not happen, we've guided in
the first quarter for CECL that [indiscernible] (00:41:13) be no impact at all other than the transitional adjustment
that we took. So just that – if you take COVID out of the equation for the first quarter, you're looking at probably
close to a zero provision in 2000 – in first quarter 2020. So, that's kind of how we looked at the COVID analysis. In
particular, we actually did some more quantitative adjustments just because of the Moody's change on as far as
their view of unemployment going into 2020 in the second and third quarter.
So we're [indiscernible] (00:41:41) history of really no losses in the marketplace and these are predominantly
residential units that are housing people in the city of New York. So, we feel highly confident that our loss content
is low but, yeah, obviously we booked a sizable adjustment that we didn't anticipate because of COVID-19.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2020
Okay. All right. And just lastly I wanted to clarify, there was some confusion at least to me the way the press
release was written and I know the share count moves happens in the first quarter. What was – how many – what
did you guys buy back this quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
It's in the press release. I mean we were slightly active and we had a little bit [indiscernible] (00:42:15) evaluate
the market depending on market conditions. But it's really not a material number left as of – yeah, very small
[indiscernible] (00:42:26). So we did buy shares...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn B. Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn B. Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. The actual share number is in the press release that you bought back this quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
[indiscernible] (00:42:42), we have the numbers on the second page, John? Yeah it's in there, second page.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn B. Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And you did not issue any shares then in the quarter [indiscernible] (00:42:51).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Oh, just normal [indiscernible] (00:42:52). It's netted against the plan. When you look at the share count in the
back of the documentation, it's netted against [indiscernible] (00:42:58) shares. So I would say probably what
we've bought back is what we've issued for MLP shares. No significant change there. We don't have – we don't
have a material buyback in place, it's insignificant.

It doesn't mean that we're not buying back shares, right? So we're not halting anything. We feel very bullish about

gave you, albeit credit issues, which we know, unforeseen credit issues, we're looking at significant EPS growth

and more importantly double-digit margin growth every quarter throughout 2020. And actually you'll see growth
continue to 2021, but I don't want to get too ahead of myself. But clearly, this has been a significant change of our
funding costs going forward. So, you'll see Q1 up 10 basis points Q1 versus up 2 – I mean, sorry, Q2 versus up

Morning, Dave.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Good morning, guys. So just back on the CRE book real quick, what was the total retail exposure you had, how
large is that segment roughly and can you just talk about like a rough breakdown of that what that is, whether it's
mixed use, strip centers, whatnot?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So again, we have approximately $1.7 billion of retail stores/shopping center, of which we've indicated about $470
million of that as deferred. That LTV in that portfolio is like 56% with a 1.70 debt service coverage ratio. As far as
further breakdown, we do have office and professional buildings in the CRE book which is a vast majority of it.
That's about $3.5 billion, of which $830 million is deferred which is 23% and that LTV I believe is about a 52%
with a 1.85 debt service coverage ratio. So, a lot of it mostly in the Manhattan region.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Yeah. And pretty low LTVs, too. That's good.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I mean we have a handful of garages. There's no people going to parking garages, so that's
going to be deferred and it's not material for us. But we would expect that to go for a deferral program until they
start opening up the city again.

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Yeah. And then you guys gave us some great color on the cash flow trends for the rent-regulated multi-family
piece. And I know you're holding most of that at a 50% risk weight given the loans meet certain debt service
coverage and LTV requirements. Was just wondering what those thresholds are for debt service coverage and
LTV that they have to continue to meet in order to maintain that capital treatment? And then do you have...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
[indiscernible] (00:45:40)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Yeah. And then do the loans have to switch to 100% risk weight if you trigger one of those thresholds or do they
have to trigger both? How does that work?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So, it's 120 is the number, 120, and then 80% LTV, 120. And we've been in constant dialogue with
obviously our regulators. But the reality is this regulatory expectation under the CARES Act is to work with the
customers. We're getting some very good latitude now based on this change under the 50% versus 100%. We
envision that after these customers come off a deferral, they'll be treated as if they were 50% risk-weighted.
That's what we're expecting.
Could that change? Possibly. We don't expect that to change. We believe that the CARES Act was very clear for
the banking sector to work with your customers. So, I believe that we'll have some grandfathering in when we
make these deferrals. And when they come back, we hope that they'll be cash flowing north of that 120, and the
LTVs will be well-insulated. So, we should have – we don't know if that's going to be the final ruling when the
regulators decide a year from now. But clearly there's a lot of regulatory guidance, and we've been working
directly with the regulators as far as some specific guidance given our business model. And it appears that under
the CARES Act there's – there's a mission here for the banking sector to step up and do right by the customer
base. Given our LTVs, given our business model, we feel highly confident that these – when we get to the other
side, people will be living in Manhattan and the five boroughs and paying their rents.

If you have to – and if you have to restructure any of those and the restructured loan actually meets all the criteria,
is it okay or it's because you've restructured it, it actually has to go to 100% risk weighted?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I think that will be fine on the reconstruction, but again, I don't want to get the cart before the horse here. Again,
we feel highly confident that as we get to the other side, people are going to be living and working in the city, and
we believe that there's still a housing shortage in Manhattan. There's still a rent regulation shortage in Manhattan.
So we think they'll be fully occupied and we're not in a luxury market. We're non-luxury lenders. Right? So even
though our buildings have a blend of rent regulated, [indiscernible] (00:47:43) is non-luxury for the most part.

So we have a unique portfolio. In the event the market was to be priced itself down as far as rentals, we're
insulated because we're not looking at the luxury market. So we feel pretty confident, but we don't have a crystal
ball. This is a, like as Collyn said, untested times but we're working with our customers and given the percentage
that has occurred. The good news in the past week or so, we haven't seen any upticks of more people asking for
deferral. So we're almost sitting here in May, we think a lot of that's been out already. So we'll monitor every
month and the next time we speak to you in next quarter, we'll have an update. But the good news is that here we
are coming into May and we don't see the spike in additional requests.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Yeah. Okay. And then, how often do you have to do that 50% cash. Is that once a quarter or once a year and
when does that typically happen?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
We do it every quarter depending on what loan comes due as far as the review. Sure. Quarterly [indiscernible]
(00:48:36) by the way, it's all automated quarterly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Cool. Okay. And maybe just one last one on expenses. How are you thinking about that trend at this point? Is that
– you were talking about 515 maybe for the year in the last call, is that still a level you think you can achieve?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. It seems that – look, I think Q1 was better than expected. I think Q2 will probably be better than expected
internally. So anywhere from 128 to 129-ish just slightly south of 130. And then maybe flat for the rest of the year.
Again, we're not seeing a ramp up in expenses. Now, we don't anticipate substantial expense because of COVID-
19, but we'll evaluate as we move along here. But I would say based on absent the pandemic versus last year, I
think our expense guide is still within that range. I don't see any major change here. I would say the only real
change is that we haven't completed our conversion and that would have probably added some savings. But I
guess it gets postponed because of the stay-at-home order. We anticipate to have that once the – once New York
opens up. Hopefully by the summer, we'll be able to do the full conversion.

Peter Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
The ones that reach contractual maturity and then get refinanced, can we just talk about what's happening to the
LTVs with those loans and also what's happening with the cap rates post the new rent regulation laws?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So, we [indiscernible] (00:50:10) our cap rates post – I'd say pre-pandemic and we actually saw a slight
drop in cap rates. Believe it or not, we didn't change the way we viewed our stress testing because of that. We do
it every six months. We evaluate the market. So, from June 30 to 12/31, cap rates actually trickled down a little
bit, believe it or not. So in our internal analysis when we look at stress testing and how we look at the potential
risk, we simply kept it flat without decreasing it.
I would say that it's too early to tell how that's going to pan out in this environment, but interest rates again near
zero. We have a higher spread. But you're still talking about a mid-3% type coupon. So, we haven't seen any
noticeable changes, yet. Who knows what happens in the next two, three quarters out, but clearly, no noticeable
change in cap rates and with that being said, when we – when we have loans that come due to us, we haven't
seen any situations where customers can cash flow out on a refinance. If anything, customers are still actively
taking down funding because they've improved their rent roll. They've been working. So, these are I would say
delayed refinancing [indiscernible] (00:51:13) have an average life that's this short, you'd assume that the portfolio
is so short because the people have delayed their refinancing so they still have equity built and they are still
drawing down equity.
And like I said, given this environment, given the nature of the difficulties in the environment, we're actually
tightening our standards on refi cash-out where we're actually withholding escrowable taxes and P&I payments for
a period of six months as part of our strategy to mitigate risk.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Winter Q

Got it. And then can I just ask about how big the PPP program is? And with this downturn, is there an opportunity
to take market share from the larger banks aside from the multi-family business?

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2020
Yeah. So Pete, for us, you know we're not a C&I lender so – we're a commercial real estate lender and mostly
multi-family. So, we've got geared up. We were a little bit late on getting geared up. We worked with third-party
providers. We partnered with a third-party provider and we were very active on the second round, so our PPP
numbers are going to be between $100 million to $200 million at best.
However, a lot of the customers that we have internally we're putting through this system and we're getting great
success. Our team has done a phenomenal job in getting it up and running. But it's interesting, this is more
anecdotal, a lot of our [indiscernible] (00:52:30) customers come from other banks, Bank of America, JPMorgan,
Citibank in particular where they had no results. These are smaller businesses that were left behind on the first
round. We put them through the second round and they were successful. And believe or not, they are switching
their accounts to NYCB. You still have to go through the vetting process. You still have to go through the BSA
process. There's a lot of work but many small businesses were left behind locally.
So, we're there for them. We're actively taking some new business but I won't see it's going to be material But I
think on an anecdotal basis, there's no question that the larger players are protecting their book and we were
there to pick up a handful of crumbs here and there to help out the local community. As Joe said this morning, it's
a family here. These are local businesses that need help and we're going to here help the local community. Not a
big number for us, but we are in the program.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2020
Joseph R. Ficalora A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I think that that number does continue to strengthen. We're in a very, very good place with the relevant
players in our niche. So our ability to not only have a performing portfolio, but a growing portfolio in the period
ahead is quite real and is very consistent with how we performed in other stressed environments. We should
assume the period ahead to be stressed. And during that period, we will gain share of what we want from the
marketplace. And therefore, as has always been the case, during periods of difficulty, we do not just better than
our peers but better than we historically have done. And this environment presents opportunity for us to lend
favorably in greater numbers in the environment in front of us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A

Great, Joe.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Chris, I would just add to Joe's commentary. Big picture, our portfolio, we're a very large player in this
marketplace. So we have 100-plus families in some of these large buildings and clusters of buildings. And we you
think about the percentage of deferral versus all the other deferrals, it's the lowest percentage. That means we're
getting significant rent collections. These are very sophisticated billionaire property owners that have devalued
equity that are going to protect their investment. But more importantly, they're not even asking for deferral. So, if
the program is out there, only 6% has come to the table on the 100-plus family dwellings, which is very
encouraging.
Now, the smaller ones, obviously, it's a higher percentage because you have that ground floor issue and you can
have 0% revenue coming in. So, going to the next months ahead as the country opens up and the city opens up
and they start working out their lease arrangements with their tenants, we envision that in the next six-month
period to start to stabilize.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Great, that's helpful. And just a follow-up, Tom, my impression has been that you still are sitting on enormous
liquidity to deploy and that that liquidity really presents new opportunities for you both on the investment side as
well as loans as you've documented. So, will that kind of get put to work in the next two quarters or do you think
it's going to take in the next year to really deploy kind of your full horsepower?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, Chris, we do have a lot of liquidity on the balance sheet. We have excess cash. We sold some securities
going into the second quarter, actually end of the – middle of the first quarter given that we felt that rates were
going to go much lower than they were. These are floating rate securities that would have been having close to
0% yield. That was about $300 million that created a lot of cash for us. We believe that'll be put right back into our

core lending product. So, we want to stay liquid, we want to have the liquidity and the cash to fund on that loan
book. I don't think there's a lot of value in the securities market right now. There was maybe a one- or two-week
blip during the end of the quarter as the market dislocated. But it seems that given where the treasury is very
active on buying all asset classes, we will probably be keeping securities portfolio relatively flat because
[indiscernible] (00:57:06) any risk-reward opportunity there and put it into our loan portfolio which, as Joe said,
Joe indicated, if this continues and we're in a difficult cycle, we tend to have significant growth. We're only
forecasting 5% but you can easily see a substantial number of growth because of the retention that we have
within our own portfolio and the lack of market players who want to step into this market.

Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens Inc.
Looking at the borrowings book, I've been surprised that the costs there haven't come in more. Can you give us
the breakdown between the structural advances and the classic advances and help me better understand how the
structured advance side behaves and re-prices relative to changes in the yield curve?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A

Thomas Robert Cangemi A

end of March, right? So we had some money coming due in the beginning of the quarter. We refinanced that at

lower cost based on what was coming off. However, where we are today, that number is close to zero if you
hedge it, if you put a derivative against and if you just go straightforward, you still had a number that's probably,
what, 50 basis points, 45, 50 basis points – 74 basis points for two-year bullet. So I think the cost is coming down
materially. We would've been active when we look at the opportunity to get unique swap opportunities. That
probably drives maybe anywhere from 25 to 50 depending on the anomaly of the marketplace and there's been a
lot of anomalies. So you could effectively borrow money, swap it out from float to fixed – fixed to float and then
you're looking at a 0% effective interest rate which is unique. But the reality is that it's significantly lower than our
current cost of that's coming due which is around 2% in 2020 – the remainder of 2020. We have about $1.2 billion
coming through this quarter, another $300 million to $400 million in Q3, another $300 million at the end of the
year and [indiscernible] (00:59:15) 1.85% is Q2, and then the back half for the year is 2.38%, so 2.38% for the six
months ended. So again...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens Inc.
I'm sorry. Are you putting that – are you more apt to put on the structured with a swap at 50 bps or are you going
to take the classic at 75?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
We may just keep it short in this ball, 45 basis points [indiscernible] (00:59:35). I mean, we have opportunities. We
don't see the Fed actively driving interest rates higher here. So, we have options, right? But the options are still all
well below 1%. So conservatively in our model, we have high cost. I gave you double-digit margin expansion with
expensive funding. So, I'm assuming our funding will be cheaper. So, I'm hoping my guide and my margin's even
conservative up double digit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens Inc.
And is that the risk to that portfolio that interest rates go higher and the Fed has – the Federal Home Loan has the
right to call it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
[indiscernible] (01:00:06) rates go up 400 basis points, they're going to call it. But again, if you think rates are
going up 400 basis points that's not what we're running in our model. We have the Fed remaining flat this year.
I'm not going to talk about 2021. I'm talking about 2020, and I don't envision any real changes to policy given the
current situation. With that being said, in the event a puttable structure gets called and rates are obvious to have
higher borrowing costs. That's correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens Inc.
Okay. Understood. And then what's the incremental securities yields, that book I mean, on a quarter-over-quarter
basis, fell quite a bit. Just curious what the incremental – what does it look like – if you do buy, what are you
buying and what's the yield on it?

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2020
Yeah. So like I said, we're not buying anything. We're just keeping it flat. So if we still get called out, we have
some calls expected. So, let's just say, we may have a few basis points bleed next quarter. If not, could be flat this
quarter depending on what prepays and speeds. We do have some mortgage-related securities. It's all agency for
the most part. So we're not really in the market buying. So I would say that, unless we see a significant dislocation
in security yields and is attractive opportunity, we'll keep it flat.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens Inc.
Okay. And then I appreciate the retail exposure in the commercial real estate book. Just curious, is there any
additional retail exposure in the specialty finance book and what's the health and characteristics of those
borrowers, if there's any?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I would say, I mean, we have a handful of maybe some grocers – some household and grocers that have been
very successful because their business is booming right now. So they've been drawing down on their facility. But
I'd say for the most part, especially finance group has been performing, a stellar performance. We haven't had a
delinquency since we've been in the business. And as far as our ratings, we're very comfortable with all the
credits we have. We're very selective, we always talked about that that what we see 96% or 90% of that we
decline. So we have large relationships, Amazon, some [indiscernible] (01:02:02) some very big large household
names. We're not the lead bank. We participate on where we feel there's low risk.
And again, this is not a high yielding portfolio but it's a low risk portfolio and it's super senior secured. I would say
on a deferral perspective, you're probably looking at maybe $200 million of deferrals on auto. But we think that the
auto sector will be fine this year and by the end of the year, that stuff will go off of deferral and we'll be back in
business. And by the way, all these clients in the auto have access to PPP and they've all been funded. So we
feel pretty good about that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens Inc.
Okay. Last one is just on capital. How comfortable are you operating at these levels especially as New York City
is the epicenter and economic conditions do remain uncertain?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So again, I would say very comfortable. Obviously, we're going to earn more money this year assuming that credit
holds itself. We've taken a sizable provision for COVID-19. Absent COVID-19, we talked about CECL, we didn't
expect to have any real provision in the quarter other than the transitional adjustment. So, we think that our
portfolios performed very well in this environment. We are not a C&I lender. We do have tenants that – landlords
that have – tenants that have retail and they have to work that out but given the deferrals program we think that
as they open up the city, as they open up America, we should be in a good place.

Morning, Ken.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Morning. Just in terms of the margin, I guess, I'm a little surprised that you don't get more benefit sort of near term
and it sounds like you get, as you said, double-digit NIM expansion sort of every quarter over the course of the
year. Can you just talk about like why it's I may so consistent over the course of the year? Is it just because of
how your deposits are re-pricing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So rates are zero. Close to zero. So, pretty much the entire liability side of the balance is getting close to zero. So
that's the major driver. At the same time, we do have lots of loans coming due and we're not getting bleed on the
loan yields going forward and the coupons are reasonable. They're not spiking but if we take the cost of funds
close to zero, pretty much all of our – most of our retail funding is tied to short-term funds, right? So like I said $6
billion plus this quarter is at 2.35%. And there's really no high cost opportunity in the marketplace. We don't
envision customers leaving the bank to go somewhere else. So, – and if that's being said we still have the ability
to borrow funds that are close to zero. So I think that the funding cost is clearly driving this opportunity. And at the
same time asset yields are holding up very nicely. So you're going to have like I said double-digit margin growth in
the second quarter. We envision that happening in Q3 and Q4 as well.
We talked about Q1 being up 2 basis points. We hit our guidance. The pandemic hit towards the middle of March
and the Fed thought of cutting interest rates. We actively cut interest rates and then we're going to see that
benefit going right into the Q2. Again, we don't know where the market's going to end up on short-term funds. But
given that the – where the country's position is, my guess is that rates are going to stay relatively low in 2020 and
most customers are not going to go past one year to restructure their CD portfolio. And as we continue to build
the savings account and not operate on operating accounts, that will also benefit a very stable cost of funds for
the bank.

[indiscernible] (01:05:32) go back. Just remember, we had five years of not seeing NII growth. We were
positioned at the lowest returns this bank has experienced. So we're in an upward trajectory both the EPS growth
and margin expansion. This will continue into 2021. We do not have the crystal ball what's going to happen 2021

and we're talking about margin expansion here but we think the margin bottomed out in the fourth quarter of 2019.
We saw that inflection point is going to continue significantly because of Fed action. At the same time, the
business model is getting a much higher spread that we're accustomed to. When the competition is robust,
Fannie, Freddie, CMBS, the whole world looking to get into the space, you're at 110 to 150 spread, right? So
when we raised that to 200 after the rent was changed, now we're north of 300. So that's a very healthy spread.

Ken Zerbe Q

Got it. And back in terms of the timing though, I mean do you have just as much re-pricing in second quarter down
couple hundred basis points as you do in say fourth quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. Second quarter on the CD side just under $5 billion and that's a 206, so it's continuing. So you're going to
get the benefit from the re-pricing in Q2 going to Q3 and more benefit in Q3 as well. That continues throughout
the whole year.
So again, I feel highly confident that we're going to have a very nice NII growth, okay top line growth, EPS growth,
assuming and I'm not talking about the potential of credit because that's the unknown out there, and I understand
that. But clearly if you run that analysis, given where our profitability was, which was sub-1% on return on average
tangible assets, you'll see a very unique growth in earnings story and growth in margin story that could continue
throughout 2021. And we're only talking to 2020 right now. It's short-term visibility. But for the short-term in the
second quarter, margin expansion double digits.

And is that margin expansion also premised on the view that your credit spreads stay above 300 basis points?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, but – yeah, but again, we have a 3.25% coupon coming on. [indiscernible] (01:07:33) pipeline. We're
feeding our pipeline through our model, right? The model is sophisticated. We just take the $2.1 billion pipe that
we have, we have 64% new money and that's going on at 3.25%. Now, new money's has gotten that new deals
that we would offer you if you come to the bank tomorrow [indiscernible] (01:07:49) credit. If you're a little less
than A, you're going to pay closer to 4%.
