Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Thank you.
Good morning. Our hope is that you, your families and your colleagues are safe and sound. We appreciate your
participation this morning and believe you'll find that our first quarter results demonstrate, once again, TriState
Capital's proven model and growth strategy. We are entering the current environment at our strongest position
ever. This differentiated model has been perfected over the last 14 years during good times and bad. The agile
nature of our business with unwavering focus on sophisticated clients in highly targeted markets has delivered
consistent performance across different environments.
Founded in 2007 at the beginning of the great recession, growing the income statement and balance sheet year
after year, TriState Capital has been profitable in every single quarter since the fourth quarter of 2009. The
balance sheet is pushing on $9 billion of assets, having surpassed $8 billion during the first quarter. We
surpassed $7 billion just six months ago, all through our well-established lines of business and purely organic
responsible growth.
The balance sheet is strong, healthy and liquid. Superior credit metrics are a product of the intentional selection of
clients, market segments and products, giving a very attractive risk profile along with the credit team that is as
experienced and disciplined as any you'll find in the business. Our diversified funding platform produced a record
level of over $1.3 billion in on-balance sheet liquidity. The relationship-driven funding mechanism enabled us to
grow deposit balances by 69% annualized during the first quarter. The balance sheet is also flexible, illustrated by
the repricing for nearly all of our floating rate deposits and the interest rate floors has put on more than 50% of the
loans, both in response to last month's cuts and the target fed funds rate.
Our Chartwell national investment management unit, our national private banking business and our regional
middle market business are designed to provide us with diverse revenue streams across operating environments.
Again, they delivered. In the first quarter, for example, organic net interest income growth was 22% annualized on
stable net interest margin and 23% annualized loan growth. At the same time, record swap fees helped to
balance investment management income that was dampened by March market volatility, offsetting positive net
client asset inflows.
Together, these three businesses generated record quarterly revenue, organically growing the top line by 15%
annualized. Pre-tax income grew 10% annualized. All in a first quarter display that was the exceptional for some
financial services companies. For TriState Capital, it's representative of what this company is built to deliver. This
consistent performance comes even as we move most of our employees to remote working environments.
Through their exceptional efforts combined with the systems, digital high end experience and scalable
infrastructure we've invested in for years, we've been able to help our clients through the historic challenges in the
first quarter.
Even as TriState Capital sales and client-facing professionals were limited in meeting face-to-face with clients in
recent weeks, I believe this company has never been closer to its clients than in the last 45 days. This is not by

accident. In March, we implemented a proactive plan to communicate with our entire client base, ensure that we
understood their concerns and needs and addressed them accordingly.
Asset quality has long been a differentiator for TriState Capital, and that has never been more important than it is
right now. As many of you know, our company does not serve retail banking customers or market consumer or
traditional residential mortgage loans. Nonperforming loans and adverse-rated credits on March 31 were
essentially unchanged from the end of last year. NPLs totaled just $184,000 on a $7 billion loan portfolio.
Adverse-rated credits of less than $35 million at quarter end made up just 50 basis points of total loans. No
additional credits were moved to the adverse-rated category.
Private banking loans represented 56% of total loans at quarter end and are primarily collateralized by marketable
securities. These are monitored on a daily basis through our proprietary technology, are liquid, over-collateralized
and subject to favorable treatment under regulatory capital requirements. The private banking portfolio is
approaching $4 billion and grew 24% on an annualized basis during the first quarter.
Commercial real estate loans totaled $1.9 billion, increasing 12% annualized during the quarter. Commercial and
industrial loans hit a record $1.2 billion, an increase of 39% annualized from the fourth quarter. Roughly $34
million or less than a third of our C&I growth in the quarter was attributed to net increased utilization of revolving
commercial credit lines. As we've grown our portfolio, we should know that we're doing so with very strong and
high quality borrowers. Through our private banking business, TriState Capital is the nation's premier provider of
non-purpose margin loans marketed through financial intermediaries.
We had extensive engagement with thousands of investment advisers and trust officers about loan requirements,
as they manage portfolios in periods of historic volatility. As a result, limited cure activity was required and this
was fulfilled in an orderly fashion. Year-to-date through April 15, we required maintenance cures on 616 loans or
approximately 7% of our private bank accounts. Compared this to the fourth quarter of 2018 when we required
cures on 3% of accounts when volatility was high, but nothing like March of 2020. We still are happy to report that
we have not had to force the liquidation of any accounts for clients to meet the cure obligations.
For TriState Capital's private banking loans, it's important to keep a few data points in mind about the portfolio.
The average loan size was less than $500,000. The median loan-to-value ratio across the portfolio was
approximately 40%, given the collateral cushion we maintain beyond the maintenance cure level. And the private
banking portfolio has maintained its zero-loss history since inception.
To give you a sense of the demand for this offering from high net worth clients and the investment advisers and
trust officers we market them through, look at our applications. In the first quarter of 2020, our team processed
new record 1,300 private banking loan applications or an increase of 65% from the first quarter of 2019 when we
generated 788 applications. In March alone, we processed 542 private banking loan applications. And in the first
15 days of April, we had 300 applications, benefiting from the past investments we've made in developing our
digital loan platform that has allowed financial intermediaries and their clients to easily engage with TriState
Capital in the current environment.
On the commercial side, we have an incredibly strong team serving middle-market clients across our [ph] four-
state (00:10:36) footprint who know this company, our clients and our market very well. Beginning in February, we
saw the early aspects of the quarantine starting to develop. We began client outreach efforts to understand the
impact of COVID-19 situation. We also organized a credit strategy committee comprised of leaders from credit,
legal, finance, operations and compliance so that we could develop responsive action plans.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
We had been talking with every one of our commercial borrowers about their experiences, their expectations for
the future and any need for additional solutions to help them through this situation. Our lender team is made up of
highly qualified professionals who average 20 years of experience, about half of them with TriState Capital for
over five years. They maintain close relationships with each of our clients and are able to make each of these
conversations deep and meaningful. From these focused conversations with our commercial clients, we develop
customized solutions, where something was needed to help them.
In connection with this effort, through April 15, we have developed deferral arrangements with fewer than 100
loans, totaling approximately $378 million and representing less than 6% of our $7 billion of total loans. We view
these arrangements as investments, investments and relationships with high quality organizations, some of which
have banked with us for more than 10 years. These investments are designed to help them weather the storm,
get back to work with the sea is calm and enable them to succeed and bank with us for another decade.
Our commercial clients and projects are well diversified by industry and property type through strong sponsors
and relationships. This diversity is also enhanced by the granularity in the portfolio, which is assisted by our [ph]
preferred hold level (00:12:40) of $10 million for commercial loan. A majority of our commercial real estate lending
is income-producing real estate, including 21% in multifamily or apartment projects, another 18% is construction
or land and at about 11% is in owner-occupied projects. Within our $1.2 billion C&I portfolio, our largest lending
category is financial services and insurance, comprising 30% of C&I loans. Another 23% is in service, including
healthcare, waste management, remediation, administration and other service industries, 16% for real estate-
related services such as portfolio and property managers, 10% is manufacturing and 4% is transportation and the
remainder is spread across a variety of industries.
Importantly, we have limited our exposure to some of the frontline types of business that may be most
immediately impacted by COVID-19, social distancing and quarantines. For example, our $3 billion commercial
loan portfolio includes only $44 million to hotels, $18 million to related to restaurant operations, $43 million to
senior housing and other healthcare-related real estate and $25 million to nonrenewable energy distribution and
production, and about $300 million to projects with retail component, each of which we have underwritten with
strong sponsors poured in recourse.
Further, we have maintained our disciplined approach of focusing on commercial lending opportunities with our
four-state Mid-Atlantic region where our team has deep experience and relationships. At the same time, we've
worked to keep our commercial loans broadly distributed across these markets and our commercial credit
verticals and strategies continue to be aligned with our deposit and treasury management verticals and strategies.
TriState Capital continues to be well capitalized under regulatory requirements. We review our capital ratios in the
context of our business model and credit quality, meaning that we believe that the very strong credit quality of our
portfolio and the amount of noninterest income, especially from Chartwell business, requires less capital cushion
and provides a more efficient use of capital than other $5 billion to $10 billion asset banks.
While we are comfortable with our capital levels at the holding company, we are exploring fixed income
opportunities to bolster capital at the bank level to support our ongoing and exceptional loan growth and maintain
excess liquidity. We are considering a perpetual preferred offering or subordinated debt, both of which we've
executed previously, as well as senior notes and intend to execute on one of these options this year.
As we noted in yesterday's news release, TriState Capital elected to defer the implementation of CECL in
accordance with relief provided under the CARES Act. We conducted a thorough analysis and determined that at
this time delaying was the right choice for this company, continued application of the incurred loss that resulted in

reserve levels of $17.3 million or 50 basis points of our total commercial loans. These levels are nearly identical to
what we would have reported had we implemented CECL in the quarter. TriState Capital's unique loan portfolio,
which is 56% collateralized by private banking loans primarily backed by marketable securities, will not require
reserve for credit loss under CECL.
As I mentioned earlier in my comments, nearly all of our floating rate deposits were repriced in March, aligned
with prevailing Federal Reserve rates and floors are in place in more than 50% of our total loans. Active
management of interest rate risk is enabled by the deliberate construction of our flexible balance sheet. Most of
our deposits are variable rate linked to indices or priced at rates set by the bank at our discretion. For loans, 93%
are floating rate and primarily indexed to 30-day LIBOR.
Turning to our investment management business, Chartwell generated fees of $7.6 million, comprising 57% of
noninterest income during the first quarter of 2020, while new business and new flows from existing accounts
were offset by outflows and market depreciation. We reported net inflows of $57 million during the first quarter.
Today, Chartwell has an excess of $200 million in institutional commitments in its new business pipeline, most of
which we expect to fund before the end of the second quarter.
As we shared with you in January, last year, Chartwell took active measures to lower expenses. By the end of last
year, Chartwell had reduced its annual expense run rate by more than $2 million. Accordingly, it also lowered its
expenses in the first quarter of 2020 versus both the linked and the year-ago periods, and EBITDA improved in
the first quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2019.
We've confidence in our investment managers' unique product offering and highly credible performance, its
outstanding distribution capability, the talented people leading its funds and their ability to attract business. Our
goal is to profitably grow this business across operating environments, accelerating this progress when the
broader economy and financial markets improve.
TriState Capital's resilient business model was designed to thrive in all operating environments, and our first
quarter performance underscores the strength of our proven approach. It's a model that our company's leadership
stands behind fully. We believe that TSC shares are dramatically undervalued even in the current market.
Accordingly, executives and directors acquired more than 167,000 shares of TriState Capital stock in the first
three months of 2020, with 21% of those shares purchased in March.
We've a solid balance sheet, ever-growing income statement and robust new business pipelines for our loan,
deposit and investment management offerings. The strategic steps we've taken in recent years and months to
make this company more nimble, efficient, innovative and position us well to help lead our clients through the
challenges of 2020 from the position of strength in order to continue delivering value to our shareholders over the
long term.
Before we open up the call to Q&A, I want to emphasize that we would not be where we are today without the
talented people we have across this organization. Individuals who joined TriState Capital and Chartwell are
successful before they ever walk through our doors. We provide them the entrepreneurial environment, the team
culture and the resources they need to flourish. In the last 45 days, their abilities and commitment, our clients
have never been more apparent today. I simply could not be prouder of the entire team than I am today.
That concludes my prepared remarks this morning. I'll now ask Dave to join me for Q&A. Operator, please open
the line.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from
Michael Schiavone of KBW. Please go ahead.

Michael Schiavone Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Good morning, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Schiavone Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So while we understand the lower risk nature of the balance sheet, is there any minimum tangible common equity
ratio that the board is comfortable running at?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
I would say, Mike, nothing like that has been clearly established. We – and in fact, review that all the time with the
board, and we feel comfortable where we are, that's the question you're asking at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
We're really focused on bank capital levels. If you look across our three businesses, you've got the asset
manager, which only really requires capital for acquisition purposes to grow through acquisition, you've got the
private bank which really only requires capital for leverage purposes. The private banking portfolio does not
require an allowance and so it doesn't require risk-based capital. And then, you've got the traditional commercial
bank which is about $3 billion of loans that requires traditional risk-based capital. And so we really focus on Tier 1
leverage at the bank, and we're comfortable with those levels at the quarter end.
As Jim mentioned, we will access the capital markets at some point this year, but we really have a unique holding
company much different than the traditional pure $5 billion to $10 billion institution in that we've got two
businesses, asset management and banking, and more than half the banking business doesn't require risk-based
capital.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
And keep in mind the asset manager throws off approximately $30 million of revenue a year.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then on the reserve build in the quarter on the commercial book, it was a bit
lower than your peers they have reported so far. Can you provide some detail around the economic assumptions
used in our credit models at this time?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah. So let me maybe start by saying, I think, you'll agree that our asset quality speaks for itself, asset quality
and underwriting. In the past 10 years, we've only charged off $37 million's worth of loans. In the past five years,
we've charged off $5 million worth of loans. So our asset quality, historically, has been much better than peers. As
I mentioned a minute ago, more than half of our bank, 56% is marketable securities, base loans over-
collateralized by those types of securities. The remaining portfolio of 44% of C&I, commercial and industrial, and
commercial real estate has an allowance that's effectively 57 basis points against those loans, which is
comparable to other institutions that are highly thought of such as First Republic.
Importantly, we don't have any retail loans. We don't have any credit cards with no mortgages or other retail
exposure that's really driven CECL provisions. And as Jim outlined, we don't have significant exposure to
industries that are currently in distress, hospitality, restaurants, hotels and energy. He also mentioned that
proactively, we've been in touch with every single one of our commercial credit clients in the past 30 days to
understand how they're doing and whether they need to seek help through deferral loan payments.
Now we'll remind you that we only have $184,000 of nonperforming loans. So we've looked at this carefully.
We've gotten to a conclusion both through the Moody's CECL model that we use in our incurred loss model that
arrives at the same place. We feel good about where we sit. We've been focused on unemployment and GDP to
answer your question specifically in terms of the economic drivers that we're looking at for both incurred and
CECL, and I would expect that you'll see us continue to build reserves in the second quarter, but we feel good
about where we are today.

Operator: The next question is from Steve Moss of B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Good morning, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley FBR, Inc.
Hi, good morning. Let me start I guess with just where are your funding costs as of March 31 and kind of also in a
related area, what are you thinking about loan spreads these days or where are loan spreads? And start there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Good morning, Steve. So as Jim mentioned, we put floors in on a lot of our loans, private banking specifically and
new commercial loans. And so what we're looking at, we're going to give you some all-in numbers. All in for
commercial loans yields of about 3.75%. All in yields for private banking loans of about 2.75%. We will, as Jim
mentioned, carry excess liquidity through the end of the year. Deposit cost we've been able to moderate quite well
in the quarter, some immediate pricing adjustments. And so you'll see deposit cost anywhere from just slightly
under LIBOR to effectively 15 basis points now. So we feel good about being able to bend the cost curve with
respect to deposits.

Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley FBR, Inc.
Okay. And just with the floors, I mean to ask how long – what's the duration of those floors?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
There's no duration. They're just there until we have a fundamental change in the rate environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah. These loans are all demand notes, and they're set up to meet the clients' needs. So overwhelmingly, we're
talking about the private banking portfolio here, but we're doing the same thing on the commercial banking,
putting floors on any of the new loans that we're putting in place. And it's about 52% of the loan portfolio as floors
on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley FBR, Inc.
Okay. And then with regard to CECL here, just wondering how do we think about the delay? Do you think about
going effective April 1 or further out? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
So the SEC came out with some guidance [indiscernible] (00:27:34) provided for this deferral of CECL, but we
really needed the SEC to provide guidance because that's the standard setter. And their requirement was that if
we delay the implementation of CECL, we would implement on the earlier day of when the government lists the
emergency declaration so in that quarter, or at 12/31/2020; the earlier of those two dates. And so it will be
implemented either at some point this year or at the very latest at the end of the year.

Yeah. It's fairly diversified, Dan, and there's 92 of them. These are businesses – keep in mind that essentially the
government shut these businesses down. And so it's a combination of principal and interest. Not for goodness
deferral. And they're either signed up for three months or six months. And as we mentioned, we aggressively went

out and talked to the clients and communicated to them, and we're doing that even before this program was
introduced.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Thank you. And so I'm assuming you did not participate in the PPP program? And if that's correct, are you
aware if any of your clients did participate in that program with other banks?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah. Let me explain to you how we participated in the program. This is a company that is really focused on its
target markets. Our target market sort of middle market companies, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, New York
with revenues between $10 million and $300 million a year. These are not small businesses at all.
So we never bothered to pursue being qualified for SBA lending. But what we did do is in fact identify parties that
we felt were highly professional, would respond to our clients. And to be candid with you, we have 42 clients that
we have positioned with other parties for that program that they could participate in. And we believe that with the
funding, it's going to be available. There probably won't be much more than another dozen that have an interest in
it at this time. We were able to get everyone for the most part that requested we got them positioned and funded.

Russell E.T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Hey, good morning. Hey, good morning, Jim. Good morning, David. Just follow up on the $378 million of
deferrals. Curious as to how you would expect that number and volume to trend in the second quarter and
whether you guys are holding any specific reserves for the deferrals?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
We're not holding any specific reserves for the deferral, and we believe that it won't have any impact on our
second quarter. Like I said, these are folks that we engage with and understand what their particular needs are
and their needs at the time were of a cash flow nature they had to essentially close their company down for a
period of time until the Governor or the President allows them to reopen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E.T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
Yeah, I would say that if anything it'll be very, very minimal since we engaged them early on in the program.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E.T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. Okay, great. Now I just want to make sure I understood there and then...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
[indiscernible] (00:32:26) the numbers have – we haven't placed right now the $378 million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E.T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Thank you for that clarification. And then my second question would also be a follow-up on the commercial
reserve. David, you mentioned the 57 basis points and that reserves would likely continue to build from where
they are today. Just curious where you would expect that commercial reserve to end the year? And what that
contemplates for potential loss rates within those two buckets?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Russell, I wish I knew. We're in very unprecedented times. We're heading into what's our – or we're in what's
going to be a really tough quarter for the US economy. And so we'll just continue to play it quarter by quarter.
We'll be as transparent with you guys as possible.
Just back to your deferral question for a second, we reached out to these customers proactively and early
because we didn't want them to exhaust all cash reserves before they came to speak with us. And so we wanted
to understand where they stood and whether they needed to seek deferrals. We've completed all those
conversations. We feel good about where we stand, but we're going to continue to check in with these people.
And that might drive more deferrals, maybe another $100 million or so, and it may drive some reserves at some
point. So what we'll do is we're going to keep talking to these clients, understanding where they stand, and we'll
keep you guys informed as that process continues to evolve.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Matt Olney of Stephens. Pease go ahead.

Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Hey, Matt.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey. I hopped on the call a few minutes late, so you may have covered this in some of your prepared remarks.
But I wanted to ask about the common equity levels. I guess the tangible book value per share was around $14.5
and that was below the forecast. And we've seen this with peers this quarter that implement CECL. But will CECL

implementation delay a TriState, I was surprised to see the lower tangible book value per share. Any color, any
kind of unrealized loss or anything that would help explain where tangible book value per share came in this
quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Matt, I'd be happy to call you separately. We talked about this a few minutes ago and we talked about how we
really focus on capital levels at the bank because at the holding company, we've got two differentiated
businesses, the bank and the asset manager. And the asset manager really only requires capital for acquisition,
growth through acquisition. And you've got the private bank that does require risk-based capital. So capital levels
really are focused on – our capital levels are really focused on commercial banks, and we're really focused on
Tier 1 leverage. But I'd be happy to give you a call afterwards, and we can talk further about that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Yeah, let's follow up on that. And then I think you also mentioned an expense initiative at Chartwell that's
been ongoing. Can you just remind me about this expense initiative? Where are we on this? Is there more to
come? And what's the ultimate goal of probability in that segment? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah. To give you a little history on Chartwell, if you look at – we acquired them in March of 2014. If you look at
our 2014, 2015 and 2016 numbers, they contributed on average about 24% to our earnings at that time. And I
would say, for the past couple of years, the past three years, that was 2014, 2015 and 2016 for 2017, 2018 and
2019, it was more of a high-single digit number at that point.
So we had put in place the infrastructure for a much larger asset base. And so we made some reductions to
general expenses and a few personnel changes there. And you're seeing it reflected in the first quarter numbers
at this point. Those changes were made in the third and fourth quarter of last year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Next we have a follow-up from Daniel Tamayo of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Thanks, again, guys. So just kind of shifting over to the balance sheet growth, you've had tremendous growth in
that private banking group. How are you thinking about growth from here kind of through the end of the year or
more in the medium term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah. I think we go by the direction on the goals that we had set before that we're looking for our loan portfolio in
general to grow by 15% to 25%, and we're certainly in line with that in the first quarter. And we expressed to you
the demand that we saw in the private banking side so far in the month of April has been pretty meaningful with
regard to applications.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Dan, you can see that portfolio grow by $1 billion to $1.2 billion this year. Again, quarter-to-quarter things could
change, but that's what it looks like right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
And do you have an ultimate percentage of the overall portfolio you'd be comfortable letting that segment run to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
No, we don't. And what it does is it clearly assists us from a capital standpoint and secondly, and most
importantly, a risk profile. There's probably not another bank in the country that's pushing on 60% of the loan
portfolio. You can count the collateral on a daily basis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Understood. Thanks. That's all I had.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Thanks, Dan.

Operator: Next is a follow-up from Steve Moss of B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley FBR, Inc.
Just wanted to tie out total expenses here. I'm not sure if I missed it. Just wondering what your expense
expectations are for the second quarter after they're well controlled here this quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Steve, I would expect the second quarter to probably be very similar to the first. Don't imagine that we're going to
get back to normal with a lot of travel and entertainment in the second quarter. That obviously those costs were
more modest than the first. I would remind you that we've got a variable cost structure. And so our expenses are
likely to stay in line with first quarter expenses as best as we can tell right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley FBR, Inc.
Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim
Getz for closing remarks.
