Head-Investor Relations, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Thanks Jason and good morning everybody. We really appreciate you joining us. We know this quarter has been
quite a whirlwind. To start things off, our CEO, Bryan Jordan; and CFO, BJ Losch will provide some opening
comments and overview of our results, and then of course we'll be happy to take your questions. Our Chief Credit
Officer, Susan Springfield, is also with us today.
Our remarks will reference the earnings presentation which is available at ir.fhnc.com I also need to remind you
that we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties and we ask you to review
the factors that may cause our results to differ from our expectations which you can find on page 2 of our
presentation and in our SEC filings. We also will address adjusted results which exclude the impact of the notable
items and these are non-GAAP measures. So it's important for you to review the GAAP information in our release

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Thank you, Ellen. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. I'm really proud of the great progress
we've made over the last nine months and integrating our merger-of-equals is a great momentum for us to keep
building in the business. We're off to a strong start in the first quarter of 2021. We've demonstrated solid
performance in the quarter with good PPNR results, reflecting the resiliency of our more diversified business
model. While loan demand continued to be muted as clients are still cautious, we're starting to see growth in the
loan pipelines and expect demand to pick up some in the back-half of the year. Our deposit growth remains
strong with inflows from government stimulus and clients continuing to preserve cash. During the quarter, we
generated impressive results on our fee income businesses and are gaining traction by capitalizing on additional
revenue synergies tied to our merger-of-equals.
I'm also proud of the work we're doing to control the things that we can control particularly around expenses and
deposit price. Despite the seasonal headwinds, we reduced our late-quarter adjusted expenses driven by our
ongoing cost discipline. We achieved annualized merger-related cost saves about $76 million in the quarter.
The improving economic backdrop from January to March and our continued prudent risk management largely
helped drive a $53 million reserve release. The power of our diversified and countercyclical model, our strong risk
profile [ph] along (00:03:22), and the benefits from our MOE helped us deliver a return on tangible common equity
of 20%. Excluding the impact of a $53 million reserve release, we generated a return on tangible common equity
of over 17.5%.
We're making great progress for our key merger milestones. We have completed early systems conversions
including our mortgage and retail brokerage conversions with wealth and trust scheduled for the summer. Our
core deposit systems conversion is still on track for the early fall of this year. We have and will continue to make
strategic investments in new technology that optimizes the client experience and improves productivity. We
continue to leverage fintech capabilities to enhance our product offerings, drive efficiency, and improve the
customer experience.
Our capital levels remain healthy with the common equity tier 1 ratio of 9.96% and we grew our tangible book
value per share to $10.30 at quarter-end. Given the relatively limited loan demand, we chose to opportunistically
deploy capital through share repurchases and bought back about 4 million shares in the first quarter. So, including
dividends, we returned a total of $143 million of capital to our common shareholders.
I'm incredibly proud of our efforts to serve our clients, communities and associates throughout the pandemic with
PPP loans, charitable contributions, and by offering our associates increased flexibility and benefits. Our team is
also intensely focused on capturing revenue synergies across markets and product lines, leveraging our
expanded suite of products, services and expertise; all instrumental in retaining and growing our client
relationships. We are increasingly optimistic about the economic recovery as we've seen improved rollout of the
vaccine in our markets which is helping accelerate reopening. We are also mindful of the fact that the past year
had a number of unexpected turns and the path forward is unlikely to be a straight line with no surprises. So,
while we're prepared for a recovery in this year, we also are prepared for the unexpected.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2021
We remain confident that the strength of our highly attractive franchise, more diversified business model and
benefits of the merger-of-equal (sic) [equals] position us well to deliver top quartile returns over the medium-term.
With that, I'll hand it over to BJ for some comments.

William C. Losch III
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Great. Thanks, Bryan. Good morning, everybody. Let's start off on slide 6 and just do a fly-by on some of the key
highlights in the quarter. As Bryan mentioned, we're really pleased with the profitability and the returns that we're
generating for shareholders. We delivered GAAP EPS of $0.40 or $0.51 on an adjusted basis, highlighted by
strong fee income, expense discipline and even further improvement in our credit quality.
And as we've said, we position the company to succeed through various cycles and our diversified business
model is working as we expected. The fee businesses are performing very well to counter rate pressure. We're
controlling what we can control with expense and deposit pricing; merger integration is on track; credit trends are
excellent; and our capital flexibility has allowed us to return capital to shareholders in a meaningful way. Given the
overall muted landscape for loan growth, we opportunistically repurchased 3.6 million shares in the quarter at an
average price of $16.12 and including dividends, as Bryan talked about, returned a total of $143 million in capital
to common shareholders.
Looking at slide 8 on adjusted financials, we give you an overview for the quarter. We generated PPNR of $343
million, up 1% from 4Q 2020. Revenues were down just slightly as impressive results from fixed income largely
offset an expected reduction in NII. While we saw a 2% linked-quarter decline in expenses which reflects ongoing
cost discipline, the benefit of merger saves despite higher revenue-based incentives and seasonal headwinds in
personnel. Given the very low net charge-offs of only $8 million were 6 basis points on a $58 billion loan portfolio.
Combined with overall improvement in the macroeconomic outlook and a reduction in our loan balances, we
released $53 million in reserves this quarter, resulting in a provision credit of $45 million. And as Bryan
mentioned, these strong results helped drive our return on tangible common equity above 20%. And even if you
adjust for the reserve release, our return on tangible common equity was over 17.5%.
Moving on to slide 9, I'll talk a little bit about net interest income. We generated reported NII of $511 million, down
$14 million linked-quarter, driven largely by a reduction in loan balances, fewer days in the quarter, and a further
decline in the average LIBOR bases. As mentioned, we are focused on controlling what we can control in this
environment and we continue to drive down our funding costs which somewhat mitigated these headwinds. We
lowered our interest-bearing deposit rate take another 6 basis points this quarter to 20 basis points overall. And
we'll continue to look for opportunities to lower our overall funding costs further while we remain in this low rate
environment.
The reported first quarter NIM was 2.63% which decreased 8 basis points linked-quarter, driven by a 10-basis-
point impact of continued increasing levels of excess cash which ended the quarter at $10.8 billion.
Moving on to slide 10 and fee income, the benefit of our more diversified platform was clearly on display again
this quarter with a $10 million linked-quarter increase driven by the great results in fixed income, along with nice
momentum in brokerage and wealth as well. Linked-quarter fixed income average daily revenue was up 25% to
$1.9 million a day, driven by favorable conditions as banks put increasing levels of excess cash to working bonds
along with the past and continued volatility in rates. In particular, our mortgage and our government-guaranteed
debts were particularly active. While mortgage banking and title decreased $4 million linked-quarter, our results

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2021
remains relatively strong compared to historical levels despite the seasonality, higher interest rates, and limited
housing inventory.
Moving on to expenses on slide 11, you'll see that adjusted expenses in the quarter were $464 million, down $10
million linked-quarter, highlighting our commitment to continue the expense discipline, along with the benefit of an
incremental $5 million reduction tied to merger cost saves. We held personnel costs overall relatively stable with
4Q 2020 levels, with additional benefits from merger cost saves and ongoing tight expense control, offsetting
seasonal headwinds from FICA tax resets and a $10 million increase in revenue-based incentives and
commissions. In our ongoing efforts to control what we can control, we are intensely focused on not only
capturing merger efficiencies but continuing to streamline processes across the platform to position us well to
continue to drive investments in the future.
Turning to slides 12 and 13, we give you a look at our loan growth and our funding profile. As expected, we
continue to see pressure on loan balances which were down $1.6 billion in the quarter driven by decreases in
mortgage-related loans, both in the consumer portfolio and in loans to mortgage companies business. Period-end
loans were up slightly at 1%, largely due to a net $1 billion increase in PPP loans. As we look forward, our lending
pipelines are showing really nice momentum, so we are optimistic that as the economy continues to improve, we
will see increased levels of customer activity in the back-half of the year. At period-end, we saw a modest uptick
in commercial utilization rates as well and we're seeing nice early signs of revenue synergies across our platform,
particularly in the areas of asset-based lending and equipment finance.
On the liability side, we saw continued inflow of deposits. Commercial deposit balance credit was driven by PPP
and consumer deposit increase has reflected the new stimulus checks. As I mentioned earlier, we leveraged our
excess liquidity position and decreased our interest-bearing deposit cost by another 6 basis points to 20 basis
points overall, which helped drive a 4-basis point decrease in our overall funding costs.
Turning to asset quality starting on slide 14, it's really hard to believe how dramatically the landscape has
changed in a year, and we are incredibly pleased with the steps that we took to reposition our overall risk profile
coming out of the Great Recession over a decade ago are now clearly being illustrated. Net charge-offs to
average loans improved 6 basis points, down 14 basis points from last quarter while non-performing loans
remained relatively stable. As I previously mentioned, the combination of a significant improvement in the overall
macroeconomic outlook and a reduction in loan balances drove a provision benefit of $45 million and a reserve
release at $53 million. And as you can see on slide 15, the allowance to (sic) [for] credit losses coverage ratio
declined only modestly from 4Q 2020 to 170 basis points in 1Q 2021. And as a reminder, we used the Moody's
February scenario and then incorporated other economic and portfolio factors to evaluate our overall reserve
coverage. We continue to feel very comfortable with our risk profile and our reserve levels.
Briefly on capital on slide 16, as Bryan mentioned tangible book value per share was $10.30, up 1% reflecting
strong earnings, and in addition to a reduction in RWA helped drive a 28-basis point improvement in our CET1
ratio to 9.96%
Moving on to slide 17 and our merger integration update, we continue to drive strong progress on the integration
front as we convert platforms and upgrade current systems, and we remain on track for the full systems
conversion in early fall of 2021. We have achieved $76 million in annualized run rate savings against our net
target of $200 million. We're still on track for an annualized $115 million by the end of the year. As a reminder, our
gross savings are higher and is providing the flexibility to continue to make technology and other investments to
drive continued improvement in processes and the overall customer experience.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2021
Additionally, we're making solid traction on revenue synergies, and thus far experienced roughly $10 million of
annualized revenue synergies that are tied to about $400 million of commercial loan commitments. We see
significant additional opportunities with revenue synergies across markets and product lines as the economic
activity continues to pick up.
On slide 18, we're really pleased with our performance just far through the first quarter of the year with all line
items in-line or better now than we provided on our first quarter earnings call in January. We have therefore
updated our expectations for both the second quarter and our full-year outlook based on the strength we are
seeing in our business and the economy. For the second quarter in particular, Bryan and I, we expect a low-single
digit decrease with average loans down modestly given the outlook. And while anticipate a continued relatively
strong environment near-term for our mortgage and fixed income business, our outlook reflects a high-single digit
to low-double decrease from the first quarter.
On the expense front, we expect non-interest expense to be relatively stable as we continue to focus on overall
expense discipline and capture our merger efficiencies. We expect charge-offs to continue to be very low in the
range of 5 to 15 basis points, and that we're likely to see continued reserve releases. We expect to see our CET1
ratio to remain in the 10% range for the second quarter. And in terms of full-year, given our strong fee income
performance in the first quarter and continued improvement in credit quality, we have provided an update for the
full-year where we now expect only a mid- to high-single digit decrease in non-interest income, lower net charge-
offs in the 10 to 20-basis-point range for the year, and a CET (sic) [CET1] target in the 9.5% to 10% range. Our
business model is working.
Wrapping up on slide 19, we're capitalizing on the opportunities of our more diversified business model and our
highly attractive franchise. We demonstrated solid revenue trends through the strength in our fee businesses
despite interest rate headwinds. We're controlling what we can control as evidenced by the positive cost expense
reductions. We're benefiting from merger cost saves and revenue synergies. Our credit quality is excellent and
we're delivering enhanced returns for shareholders.
Before I hand it back over to Bryan, I just wanted to acknowledge Aarti Bowman who all of you certainly know,
this happens to be my 50th earnings call with First Horizon and she has been there every step of the way with all
of us. And she will be moving on to pursue a passion of being Head of Development for an excellent non-profit
here in town and she's very excited about that. We're very excited for her about that. And I'm deeply thankful for
everything that she's done for us. She has made us a better place and a better investor relations group and we
will miss her.
So, with that I hand back over to Bryan.

Thank you, BJ. I will add my thanks and appreciation for the great efforts of Aarti over the last 10 or 12 years. She
certainly will be missed.
I am exceptionally proud of our continued execution and the results that we're delivering. We feel good about the
strength of our balance sheet, capital, and liquidity positions as the economy starts to improve. We've maintained
underwriting standards and built a diversified portfolio focused on profitability and stability.

Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I wanted to first ask about loan growth. I think if you look at period-end loans, ex-PPP and warehouse, they were
down about 10% annualized, which is not really a big surprise. I think the industry has seen that as a whole this
quarter but how do you think about what gets loan growth headed in the right direction? It seems like most of your
clients are flushed with cash. When do you think you'll really start to see some decent loan growth? Is it this year
or do we have to wait for next year? What are your thoughts on the timing there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Hey, Brady. It's BJ. I'll start. So we talked in our opening comments about significantly increased activity. And just
to give you a little bit more color on that, on the commercial side, our pipelines which we have a high confidence
of closing are up 60% to 70% from the beginning of the year. So we are starting to see really, really nice trends
there. Utilization rates picked up slightly, so that is – we're spending a little bit more activity as well. And we
started to see a little bit of turn in some of our markets, particularly in places like North Carolina or Middle
Tennessee, Alabama on the specialty side, asset-based lending, equipment finance are starting to see pretty
good upticks. We expect loans to mortgage companies to strengthen in the spring and summer buying seasons.
So, on the commercial side, we are certainly seeing a lot more activity and I'm optimistic about what that means
for our balance sheet in the back-half of the year.
I would also say on the consumer side, if you look at our consumer portfolios, we have seen a fairly meaningful
decline on those portfolios as people have refi'd and a lot of that has gone to secondary production. We did make

some changes in our product set on the affluent side and then in certain areas around 7, 10-year ARMs, 15 year-
fixed where we believe that that's going to change the trajectory of our portfolio growth on the consumer side. And
as a matter of fact, we have seen lots of pipelines increased significantly in the last 45 days as made those
changes. So, all of that to say is we see a lot of activity starting to come on and we're optimistic about the back-
half of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. That's good to hear. Then my follow-up is just on the buyback. If you look at your common equity tier 1, it's
now 10%. You were active in the buyback. I mean you have a $500-million buyback out there. That's a big
number. I think you can repurchase about 5% of the company over the next couple of years. Is the right way to
think about it that you guys will utilize the full $500 million over the next couple of years or do you think that's too
big of an assumption?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. I think as we've talked about before Brady, it's always going to be opportunistic repurchases. We did $56
million this quarter at an average price of $6.12 (sic) [$16.12]. So we felt pretty good about that. We want to put
our capital into loan growth. We would have thought that CET1 would have been more towards the 9.5% range,
obviously it floated up on lower RWA. We just talked about the fact that we think organic loan growth is coming
back. All of that to say is we are bullish on ourselves and so we do expect to continue to opportunistically
repurchase shares. And whether it's over the next couple of quarters or the next 1.5 years, using most or all of
that authorization is our expectation.

Brady Gailey Q

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just trying to get a sense for the margin trajectory here. I
appreciate the disclosure on the purchase accounting accretion and things like that. How does the [ph] PPPCs
(00:26:13) kind of look and then on a core basis if you strip out PPP and PAA, what would be the kind of near-
term expectation? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Hi, Michael. Good morning. It's BJ. So, I'll start. I'll give you kind of an overall view of our PPP trajectory that may
help. So, in terms of round one, we expect that 90% of those will be forgiven by sometime in the third quarter of
8

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2021
this year. So, I think we originated something along the lines of $4 billion to 90% of that gone by third quarter, and
therefore all the fees associated with that accelerated and collected by that. On round two, we're at about $1.3
billion or so and we'll probably climb a little bit more of that. We assume that those fees will be accretive over the
next 1.5 years or so. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color on PPP.
In terms of net interest income and the trajectory, they are based on my commentary earlier around a little bit
more optimism on loan growth in the back-half of the year. Our continued focus on driving down deposit cost
where we can where we have a little bit more opportunity, and the LIBOR base is hopefully flattening out here,
Ellen's knocking on wood. We expect that our NII as we've said on slide 18 might be down modestly. But
generally around this area and hopefully we can see a little bit of uptick towards the back-half of the year.
In terms of margin, we estimate that anywhere between 30 and 40 basis points of drag on the margin today is
coming from the excess cash. We certainly want to put that to work in loan growth. We do expect that deposit
growth will continue to remain elevated but over time start to come back out. But it's going to be here for a while.
So we're focused less on the margin and more on stabilizing and starting to improve the NII trajectory.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
That's great color. Very helpful. And maybe just as my follow-up, we've seen a bunch of deals announced here
lately in the industry. You guys are well on your way with IBERIA. What's the appetite as we move forward for
additional deals if you can update us and how those priorities maybe changed just given the recent activity?
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Hi, Michael. This is Bryan. Our focus really hasn't changed. As you point out, we're making good progress on the
integration of our merger-of-equals; IBERIABANK and First Horizon. We feel outstanding opportunity exists in our
existing franchise. We see great demographics in our southern footprint, great growth opportunities. And so our
focus is clearly on getting the merger integrated. And then as we come out of the integration in the fall, really start
to build momentum and capitalize in these growth markets that we see out there. So, our priorities haven't
changed. It really is trying to capitalize and deliver the benefits we believe that exist and the work that we're doing
today with our merger-of-equals.

I wanted to start, so nice start out of the gate on revenue synergies. Could you give more color on the $400
million of commercial loans you're calling out from the synergies and how are you seeing the bigger picture now
for revenue synergies?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Good morning, Steven, it's Susan. As it relates to revenue synergies and BJ alluded to some, we're seeing two
areas specifically early on really benefiting from the merger-of-equals: One is the legacy IBERIA specialty
business which is equipment finance. We're seeing great opportunities across all of our markets and even within
some of our other specialty lines who have equipment needs. So that's going to continue to build. Just as a side
note during a COVID environment that we've already seen $400 million in commitments related to revenue
synergies I think is great. And then also asset-based lending which as you know First Horizon has been in that
business for many, many years and we're seeing great referrals from our legacy IBERIA market and relationship
managers. We also believe there is an opportunity to continue to expand specific bankings within those two. Also,
I would be remiss if I didn't mention mortgage. The opportunity that we now have with the legacy IBERIA
mortgage business, we're seeing mortgage activity both secondary and portfolio mortgage synergies as it relates
to bringing that together.
So, we're very, very pleased. The bankers – the great thing and our bankers are so excited to have additional
things that they can talk to clients about and not have those go to another institution. So I feel very, very confident
that we'll continue to see that build as the economy continues to open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Hey, Steve. This is Bryan. I'll add to that. I think this is one of the more underappreciated opportunities in our
merger. I think there's a lot of revenue synergies that we would generate. Some of it is the obvious stuff; a bigger
balance sheet. Some of it is product set that Susan just described. And say, for example, the private client and
wealth business, that's an area that IBERIABANK is not focused on as much. We're having really good success
hiring private bankers and wealth managers in our Florida footprint for example. So we look at this area from a big
picture perspective.
We captured or tracked $30 million and then sort of stopped on the Capital Bank merger several years ago. We
think this opportunity of combining these two organizations and bringing this combined product set; bigger
balance sheets, the opportunity to do more for our customers, we think we're going to well exceed the $30 million
of revenue synergies over the next couple of years that we've created in our Capital Bank merger.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. Bryan, a big picture question for you. So you guys are delivering on the cost saves from
IBERIA. The revenue synergies are starting to come through. Countercyclical businesses are doing their job. I
know 2021 is a bit of an odd year given the pandemic and you have PPP program stimulus, et cetera all
impacting loan demand. But from a big picture view, could you talk about how do you see growth potential of this
new company over the longer-term? Is this a mid single-digit grower or is this a high single-digit grower, what do
you see for us? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. That's a good question. You didn't stipulate what you think the economy is going to do when we come out
of all this stimulus. I think we are going to have a footprint and a demographic that is going to grow at or above
what you see in peers and others. As I look at our footprint, you think about the markets we're in and we're in
Atlanta, Houston, Dallas, Miami, we're in 15 of the top 20 MSAs in the South. Pre-pandemic, the South was
growing faster than the US as a whole. Post-pandemic, I think that has probably accelerated.
And if you look at those markets, in many cases we have a very focused and in some ways smaller presence. But
we see a tremendous opportunity to take that focus and expand that presence. So the work that Michael Brown
and our bankers are doing today to position us through hiring, et cetera, I think we're going to be in a position that
we will clearly grow better than average.
And [indiscernible] (00:35:31), I think over time that the growth in the US economy is going to return back to that
2% to 2.5% area. So I think that would dictate that we probably be in more than mid-single digits. But I think the
easier way to describe it is I think we will do better than most in terms of being able to deliver growth given where
we're positioned, the focus of our bankers and the product set that we offer.

Hi, John.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
And, first off, best of luck to Aarti as well in your new gig. On the excess cash side, I believe you're sitting on
about $10.8 billion in excess. And I just want to see if you can give us just a little bit more color on how you're
thinking about the deployment there. I know you indicated it in the loan growth opportunities but outside of that
where do you see opportunities? Are you looking at the bond portfolio any differently these days or do you see
any non-portfolio purchases or areas like that? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Hey, John. So I see it in a couple of different ways. One is we are optimistic that loan growth is going to come
back into the – some of this excess cash. So that's priority number one. Number two, I think over time there's
going to be a reduction in deposit balances as the stimulus rolls off, as economic activity picks up, commercial
clients will go to cash holdings first then lending second. So I think there's a lot of activity to see a little bit above
to that. But I think deposit levels will come down because of that as well.
On the securities portfolio, we did modestly increase it this quarter and we'll look for opportunities to deploy that
but I wouldn't expect that we're going to significantly increase the securities portfolio. We're really looking more at
deploying it on the loan growth side. So, as I said before, yeah, of course we'd like to put excess cash to work, but
this is a high-class problem to have. It's really just hurting the NIM and not really hurting our NII. So to me
deploying it is all upside.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Great. Thanks, BJ. That's helpful. And then separately on the – a lot of focus around the countercyclical
businesses here certainly doing your job. I agree. But I guess if you could just talk about the outlook for each in
terms of the capital markets business, you saw a $1.9 million ADR this quarter, certainly a high level. Where do
you see that going just given the backdrop here on the rate side? And then separately I guess also on the
mortgage warehouse business, if you can give us an outlook there as well given the rate dynamics? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Sure. So, starting on fixed income, $1.9 million was very, very strong in the quarter. We expect continued
strength, maybe not there, but maybe more in the $1.5 million, somewhere between the $1.5 million and $1.9
million where we're at this quarter; 90-plus percent of the business days. Last quarter, we had $1 million days
across the desks; that is very, very strong. So, all-in, like we've said in our outlook on slide 18, we expect that
strength to continue but maybe not quite at the $1.9 million level that we saw this quarter.
On loans to mortgage companies, as you would know we do see seasonal declines in the first quarter. We do
expect some pickup in the second spring volume season happens into the third as well. So we do expect a little
bit of a pickup from first-quarter levels. So, that will help drive some of the loan growth that we see in the back-half
of the year.

John, also we – in mortgage warehouse, we [indiscernible] (00:40:30) has done a great job of continuing to add
clients but just in the last two years, the client count has grown at about 8%. So we've got more clients that are
working with us. And obviously when the business is flat, we flex the lines up and we'd like to be the first bank
they come to when they need [indiscernible] (00:40:50) for their clients for mortgage lending. So we think we're

Operator: The next question is from Brock Vandervliet from UBN (sic) [UBS]. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thank you. Just following up on John's question BJ, it sounds like you're relatively cautious given the rate
environment on securities which I understand. We are seeing some of your peers, particularly those with no
mortgage banking operations simply retain more on the residential side in this environment especially if they can
avail themselves to jumbo or non-QM, something with a stepped-up rate. Is that part of your strategy here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Hey, Brock. Yes. So going back to a couple of questions ago where I was kind of talking about loan growth
outlook. On the consumer side, you're exactly right. We did make some changes to some of the portfolio products
to try to position them more attractively for our affluent clients but then also our retail clients in general. And like I
said, there's a lot of pipeline in the last 45 days for portfolio production. It's up pretty, pretty significantly. So, yes,
we are looking to put a little bit more on the portfolio.
On the securities side, just to give you a little bit more color, I mean the yields that we're seeing right now coming
on the portfolio would be in the 1.25% range with a five-year duration. So we're trying to pick our spots there but
we'd rather do what we just talked about which is increase portfolio production, serve more clients particularly on
the employment side, give our bankers more to talk to our clients about it and that's exactly what we're going to
do.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. This is Bryan, Brock. And as you think about the alternatives for investing this excess cash, if you're doing
anything in securities portfolio or mortgages, you're adding duration and so our preference has always to use our
balance sheet for building customer relationships, and at least in the mortgage products which you have the
relationship opportunity either to expand it or solidify it, you don't get that securities portfolio so we'll always look
for opportunities if we're going to add duration and add it to our loan book.

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And just as a follow-up I think the only thing that's rebounded more than bank stocks in the last year has
been oil prices. I didn't hear you mention that as a source of incremental growth. Could you talk about that area,
obviously a focal point in the past for the bank, is it a question of seeing a different risk reward here or other
concerns or how are you thinking about energy?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. This is Bryan. That's an important business I mentioned in the growth markets that we're in. I mentioned
Dallas and Houston clearly, and Texas is an important product set and we are in all likelihood is going to have
continued presence in the energy lending. All likelihood that exposure will be flat to down-ish. We expect that
those portfolios will come down some and that we will reduce our exposure a little bit over time. We think it's
important to be in those markets and to facilitate lending in oilfield services, in E&P and so on and so forth but we
also think it's a very volatile place to land, and so we're not going to increase our exposures in all likelihood. We're
going to focus it much more on how do we support the commercial businesses in both of those markets.

Good morning.

Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Most of my questions have been asked but Bryan two questions. I assume that when loan demand does return
more the competition is going to be quite challenging given all the excess liquidity in the system. I'm just
wondering how you guys are thinking about that?
And then my second question is when do you think we will know what the real estate implications are going to be
from the shift to more working from home for the banking industry's employees? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Thanks, Jennifer. First on loan demand, you're absolutely right. It is a very competitive environment and
probably becomes more competitive every day. I would argue that you've got competition around pricing
obviously and duration or term but you're also starting to see more competition around structure. We are being

mindful of how and where we compete, where focus is, as we've pointed out a couple of times in the prepared
comments, on the strength and stability of our balance sheet. And we're also mindful that growing with our
customers and protecting our customer base is important. So we're being very thoughtful on a transaction-by-
transaction basis. And we're trying not to draw a whole bunch of bright lines other than let's make sure that we're
booking assets and serving our customers in a way that will be good for our customers through the long-term. It
will be good for our balance sheet through the long-term.
With respect to real estate and Susan will have probably some additional comments, I think that scenario is going
to take a little while to unfold. If you take us as an example, we're working through now how and when we return
to the office over the next three or four months, and we expect that we will be bringing the vast majority of those
that are working from home. But you have to keep in mind about half of our people or more are in the office today;
whether it's in a banking center or whether it's in an operation center or a technology center et cetera.
So we're looking at return to work. We think that there's going to be some short-term impact on commercial real
estate. As I focus on it today, I'm more focused on can we see the returns that are opening in some of the
businesses like hospitality and restaurant services where we need to get workers back to come back at full
capacity. So I think more the short-term stress in commercial real estate is are we going to be able to get
properties opened because we can get housekeeping and food servers and so on and so forth back to work.
I think the commercial real estate sector will probably level out over time as more people come back to the office.
I think there are tremendous amount of benefit for people being together at least. If not with more flexibility but
more together so that you get the communication, the collaboration, the culture; all the things that go along with
interacting with one another.
Susan, I don't know if you want to add anything at all?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. I'll add a few things just around office in general. As Bryan and BJ both said earlier, we are in very
attractive markets in the South and we have seen even during the pandemic and still as we're emerging out of it,
interest in companies that essentially have been relocating into some of the markets that we're in places like
Raleigh, South Florida, Atlanta, Birmingham; Houston, Dallas to name more than a few. So even if office space, in
the big picture, does become somewhat of an issue we believe we're well-positioned because of the markets that
we're in.
The other thing I would say, Jennifer, is that we've remained very consistent and prudent in our underwriting
across office and the average price equity in our office portfolio is in excess of 35%, I think 38%. We don't have
huge loans; just one office building is our average loan size and that portfolio is about $12 million.
And then we're diversified across our own geography; Florida, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Georgia,
Louisiana would be our top-selling six markets which is what you would expect based on our footprint. So based
on our underwriting, the potential for good things in our portfolio I think is greater than others because of the
markets that we're in and the way that we underwrite those loans prior to the changes.

Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Thanks. You may have mentioned this earlier this morning. I just want to go back to the loan yields and
comparing kind of new business going forward compared to what the core yield was, I'm just looking at the details
on slide 12.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Hey. It's BJ, Chris. So, on new production on the commercial side, we're seeing a yield in high-2s, let's say,
blended across variable and fixed. On the consumer side, it's going to be a little bit higher than that in the low-3s.
But that's what we're seeing today. So, repositioning of the book in terms of new production is going to be a little
bit less than what we see, which obviously is going to put pressure on the margin. Again, I think as volume starts
to pick up in the back-half of the year, so hopefully, we can mitigate some of that. But hopefully that gives you a
little bit our view.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Hey, Chris. This is Bryan. With respect to coming out of a pandemic and all of the uncertainty that that created,
you wouldn't expect to see spreads compressing at the pace that they are. And as I suggested in my response to
Jennifer's question a minute ago, there's a lot of competition and a lot of that competition is manifesting itself in
spreads. And unfortunately, we think that we in the industry are looking at tighter spreads for some period of time
here as there's so much excess liquidity after trying to get deployed in loan growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
No. I appreciate that. Thank you for the additional color. And then just – BJ, just a follow-up on the gain on sales
spread in the mortgage business. Are there any technology improvements that essentially help too on the cost
side that as time evolves that the gain on sales spread may not come back as much as it historically did?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Chris, when you say come back as much, what do you mean?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Well, I mean just comparing where we are today at 3.70% compared to being in the 3s or 2s a year ago.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. I mean I think there are significant process improvements that we're working on in the mortgage business.
It's kind of hard to deal with that right now when you have so much volume, but we have a lot of things that we're
trying to do to keep those spreads up higher. But I do think that our expectation is they'll continue to moderate
more towards maybe the 3.5% range this year. But it remains to be seen because as you know there's a lot of

moving parts that go into the gain on sales spread. But they've been pretty healthy over the last three quarters at
least, and so we expect that to be above somewhat the historical levels for another couple quarters.

Hi, Timur.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Good morning. My first question is a follow-up to your response to John's question on excess liquidity. Just
looking at the deposit book, is there a way to gauge how much of that could potentially come out as borrowers
start to engage in the CapEx activity and using their own balance sheets to do that? And is it going to take years
for the excess liquidity to get back towards normalized level or do you foresee that being a quicker process?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. We try to do that analysis in terms of how much of a [indiscernible] (00:55:41) come out over time. Just to
give you maybe a little bit of context of how I think about it, our excess cash position for a company our size
should be more than the $700 million to $1 billion range in any given quarter. We're in $11 billion right now. So I
don't think that $10 billion of excess cash comes out over the next couple quarters. I think it's going to take some
period of time for it to be to be soaked up. So I think excess cash positions are going to be here for a while. With
that said, I don't expect it to continue to be at the $10-billion level. I expect it to continue to fall based on increased
loan growth, increased usage of those excess cash balances, particularly our commercial clients to burn off of
stimulus checks, on the consumer side, et cetera. So – but I think it's going to be here to stay for a while.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then as a follow-up, maybe switching gears and looking at credit and the reserve position. So credit
obviously was very clean this quarter. To what extent or qualitative overlay is still being applied to maybe slow
down what otherwise would have been a larger reduction in the reserve? And as we look ahead, barring any
changes in the credit picture, should we expect to see accelerating declines in the allowance level?

Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
We are feeling very good about the credit outlook as it relates to coming out of the pandemic. We're talking with
clients and with bankers. We're really starting to see a lot of renewed activity come back to that 2019 level so
we're optimistic, although again they're still waiting to see additional vaccinations et cetera and some states
[indiscernible] (00:57:50) completely. But we do, based on what we know now and what I've seen in portfolios, I
would expect that we'll see additional reserve releases throughout the remainder of the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah, I agree. I've said in my earlier comments that based on what we're seeing and the economic outlook and –
I mean, we have said for quite some time that we significantly repositioned this credit portfolio since the financial
crisis and it's showing up at the very low levels of charge-offs we've got. So, all of that to say, we're at 1.70%
coverage ratios and pre-pandemic, on a combined basis, we would have been at 1.10% that implies – excuse me,
that we've got pretty significant reserve releases assuming that the economy continues to improve.
So do we get back there by the end of this year? Probably not. But do we get that closure to maybe first or
second quarter levels by the end of this year? Yes, probably.
