MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's Bank of America Earnings Announcement. At this time,
all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please note this call may be recorded and I will be standing by if you

Lee McEntire
Senior Vice President-Investor Relations, Bank of America Corp.
Thank you, Catherine. Good morning. Welcome. Hope everyone has had a good weekend. Thank you for joining
the call to review our third quarter results. I hope everyone's also had a chance to review our earnings documents
released earlier this morning. As always, they are available, including the earnings presentation that Brian and
Alastair will refer to during the call, on the Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website.
I'm going to first turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan, for some opening comments. And then, I'll ask
Alastair Borthwick, our CFO, to cover the details of the quarter.
Before I turn the call over to Brian, I'll just remind you that we may make forward-looking statements and refer to
non-GAAP financial measures during the call. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current
expectations and assumptions and they are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual
results to materially differ from expectations are detailed in our earnings materials and the SEC filings that are
available on the website.
Information about non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to US GAAP, can also be found in our
earnings materials that are available on the website and in the docs.
So with that, I will turn it over to you, Brian. Thank you.

Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Good morning and thank you for joining us. I want to start by sending our thoughts to the impacted areas from the
devastation of recent storms, especially our impacted teammates and their families. Our teams remain busy
assisting those clients and associates in the impacted areas.
So, we're going to start on slide 2 of the earnings materials. This quarter, Bank of America reported $7.1 billion in
net income or $0.81 per diluted share. We grew revenue 8% year-over-year. We delivered our fifth straight
quarter of operating leverage. Every business segment delivered operating leverage. This takes us back to our
five-year run before the pandemic.
The highlights this quarter were also once again marked by good organic customer activity. This was coupled with
a significant increase in net interest income. In addition, the teams adapted well to our new capital requirements
and as a result, our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio or CET1 ratio improved by nearly 50 basis points to 11%, moving
60 basis points above its current minimums.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2022
The decline from prior-year reported net income and EPS comparisons reflect a reserve build versus a reserve
release last year. At the same time, however, our asset quality remains strong as net charge-offs and several
other metrics in fact improved from the second quarter 2022. Pre-tax pre-provision income grew 10% year-over-
year.
From a return perspective, we produced a 15% ROTCE and a 90 basis point ROA. Our efficiency ratio this
quarter dropped to 62%. Taking out the litigation, it would have been 61%. So, even while investing in marketing
and people and technology and physical plant, the team continues to drive operational excellence. An easy way
to think about this is we currently operate Bank of America with less people than we had in 2015, seven years
ago.
Let's go to slide 3. Those continued investments over the past several years in our people, tools and resources for
our customers and teammates as well as our new and renovated financial centers has allowed us to continue to
enhance the customer experience and fuel organic growth as we drive responsible growth.
In the third quarter alone, we added more than 400,000-plus net new consumer checking accounts. We added 1.3
million new credit card accounts. We added 100,000 new funded investment accounts in our Consumer business.
Customers are finding it increasingly convenient to access us. Digital users grew to 56 million. Logins by those
users cleared 3 billion in the past quarter, 1 billion per month. Erica surpassed 1 billion interactions since it was
introduced four years ago this quarter. It has become a primary interaction method for our clients, with more than
130 million interactions this quarter alone.
When you look at our sales, 48% of third quarter sales were digital, a 36% year-over-year increase. This occurred
even as we fully reopened our financial centers and had our teammates also selling. Now, once again, you could
find all these digital statistics and more in the appendix of our earnings material as usual. I encourage you to look
at those statistics for every one of the lines of business, not just Consumer. They compare favorable to any of the
competitive measures we see when we see people actually publish their numbers.
At the same time, 27 million customers visited our financial center in the quarter. This highlights the importance of
having both high-touch and high-tech approach. In wealth management business, we added 400 advisors this
quarter. Our advisors added nearly 6,000 new households in the Merrill and Private Bank areas. We saw solid net
flows despite the turbulence in the markets. 80% of our GWIM customers are digitally active. 30% of the new
Merrill accounts are opened digitally. That, combined with our consumer investments business, has seen more
than $100 billion of net client flows year-to-date.
We continue to see increased activity both in investments as well as the banking products in this area. This
quarter, GWIM opened a record number of bank accounts. GWIM also saw its 50th consecutive quarter of
average loan growth. The banking capabilities and success differentiates our platform. The business grew
revenue, delivered operating leverage and saw a record pre-tax pre-provision growth even in choppy markets.
As we turn to Global Banking, ending loan balances were down linked quarter. However, we did see solid
production in this area and that was offset by client pay-downs, decrease in the value of foreign-denominated
loans and loans sold to manage our risk-weighted assets, which helped us build the capital levels I talked about
earlier.
As we look at Global Markets, the team had a strong third quarter in sales and trading performance. In fact, in the
– third quarter of 2022 was the strongest since the third quarter of 2010. It grew 13% from last year. It was led by

strong performance in our macro FICC business, which has benefited by investments made over the past year.
We had no trading loss days this quarter.
Let me also make a few points using the customer activity highlighted on the continued resilience of Bank of
America's broad customer base.
So, if you look at slide 4, you can see some points about the overall health that demonstrate what's going on in
the customer base. Let me make a couple key points. First, consumers continue to spend at strong levels.
Second, consumer customer average deposit levels for September 2022 remain at multiples of their pre-
pandemic levels. You can see that in the lower right. Third, there's plenty of capacity for borrowing as credit card
balances at BAC are still 12% below pre-pandemic levels and the payment rates on those credit cards are 1,000
basis points over pre-pandemic levels.
So, on spending, a couple thoughts. A perspicacious analyst might wonder whether talk of inflation, recession and
other factors would fructify in a slower spending growth. We just don't see it here at Bank of America. Year-to-
date spending of $3.1 trillion through September is up 12% compared to last year.
Second, as you look across the periods, you can see in the trend of year-over-year spending. As we entered the
pandemic, we saw spending decline and quickly recover and grow across the quarters. And while still strong in
September at 10%, spending growth has slowed just a bit from the 12% year-to-date pace, which shows you that
earlier in the year was the faster year-over-year growth rate, but still strong and the first two weeks of October
show that strength as still growing at 10%.
It's notable that it isn't just inflation that is driving spending as transactions are up at single-digits year-over-year
pretty consistently. You'll also note, on the bottom left, the continued growth in goods and services, particularly
retail, toward experiences of travel and entertainment. While fuel price volatility continues, it is not currently
impacting the spend levels in this quarter as prices stabilize.
On the level of customer liquidity – the level of customer liquidity remains strong. Average deposit balances of our
consumer customer remain at high levels relative to year-ago. These balances are still multiples of the pre-
pandemic periods and they were largely unchanged at these elevated amounts for the month of September.
These deposit levels suggest continued capacity for spending at healthy levels.
On slide 5, we show you, as we did last quarter, some other stats about resiliency. As you can see, whether you
look at early or late-stage card delinquencies, they all remain well below our pre-pandemic levels. These are
decades-old lows and we're just now seeing gradual move off these lows in early-stage delinquencies. Late-stage
delinquencies are still 40% below pre-pandemic levels. Keep in mind asset quality metrics were strong even
before the pandemic.
On this page, what you see is the 30- and 90-day card delinquencies. If you compare them against the average
for the past five years leading up to the pandemic, a period of growth and unemployment falling, those averages
were 183 basis points and 91 basis points, respectively. So, the current ratio delinquencies would have to worsen
30% or more to even approach that five-year pre-pandemic average at a time of economic growth and falling
unemployment. So, consumers remain resilient.
Let me take a couple minutes to talk to you quickly about the balance sheet and I'll turn it over to Alastair. As you
think about loan and deposits balances in general, we're seeing what we expected as monetary policy tightens.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2022
On deposits, we see clients with excess liquidity looking for yield, with that being the global banking movements
you can see from – moving from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing accounts.
Or in our wealth management business, we saw clients shift out of brokerage sweeps into preferred deposits or
other investment products like Treasuries that we offer. But if you look at our core customer base where the
transactional balances drive the outcome, we are seeing steady balances driven by new account activity in the
good value proposition we have for our customers.
When you think about loans, consumer loan balance growth was led by card and reflects increased marketing
and continued re-opening of financial centers building high levels of new customer relationships. On commercial,
while average loans rose $16 billion linked quarter or 12% annualized, you did see a modest ending balance
decline as good loan production was offset by the sale or syndication of $3 billion of loans and also by $4 billion in
negative foreign currency impacts.
We, obviously, took activity on balance sheet optimization which helped our RWA discussion – helped reduce our
RWAs and led to the capital levels I talked about earlier. We have provided an update in the appendix as to the
credit transformation of our loan portfolio and a few other consumer credit slides that help illustrate the quality of
our portfolio under years of responsible growth. We updated the slides again this quarter to show you them and
you can find them in the appendix and I recommend them to you.
So, in summary, client activity remains good. NIIs has improved quickly and the customers' resilience and health
remains strong. We've also managed our expenses very well. We drove operating leverage. The team managed
the balance sheet well and improved capital, even increased our dividend and bought back a modest amount of
shares. We call that responsible growth.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Alastair.

Alastair Borthwick
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Thank you, Brian. And I'll start by adding a little more detail on the income statement and refer you to slide 6
highlights. You can see here revenue of $24.5 billion grew 8%, with NII improving 24% year-over-year, while our
fees declined 8%. And I'll cover the NII improvement in just a moment.
On noninterest income, the volatility and the levels of market activity drove a year-over-year decline in investment
banking and asset management fees, while sales and trading benefited from investments made in the business
and the volatile market conditions. Additionally, service charges moved lower for two reasons.
First, in Consumer, we completed the sweeping changes around insufficient funds and overdraft in June, marking
a 90% reduction from June of 2021. Second, our corporate service charges declined as earned credit rates
increased for clients and that overwhelmed organic growth in the gross fees associated with Treasury
Management services performed for our clients.
Expenses this quarter were $15.3 billion and they included the settlement of our last large remaining legacy
monoline insurance litigation. As you likely saw, on October 7, we filed the 8-K, announcing a settlement that
resolved all of the outstanding litigation with Ambac, and that dates all the way back to the 2008 financial crisis.
We recorded $354 million in litigation expense this quarter, above previous accruals for payment of the
settlement. And without that litigation cost, our expense would have been just below the $15 billion mark.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2022
Okay. Let's move to the balance sheet and we'll look at slide 7, where you can see during the quarter, the balance
sheet declined $38 billion to $3.07 trillion. That was driven by a $46 billion decline in deposits and coupled with a
$53 billion decline in securities. Our average liquidity portfolio declined in the quarter, reflecting the decrease in
deposits and security levels. At $941 billion, our liquidity still remains $365 billion above pre-pandemic levels, just
to give you an idea of just how much our liquidity has increased.
Shareholders' equity was stable with the second quarter at $270 billion, as earnings were offset by capital
distributed to shareholders and the change in AOCI from rate moves. We paid out $1.8 billion in common
dividends. We bought back $450 million in gross share repurchases, and that covered our employee issuances in
the quarter, leaving no dilutive impact for shareholders.
AOCI declined $4.4 billion as a result of the increase in loan rates, and we saw the impact primarily in two ways.
First, we had a reduction from a change in the value of our AFS debt securities. That was $1.1 billion and that
impacted CET1. Second, rates also drove a $3.7 billion decline in AOCI from derivatives, and that does not
impact CET1. That reflects cash flow hedges mostly put in place last year against some of our variable rate loans
and that protected us against CET1.
With regard to regulatory capital, our supplemental leverage ratio increased to 5.8% versus our minimum
requirement of 5%, which still leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth. And our TLAC ratio remains
comfortably above our requirements.
Okay. Let's go to the CET1 waterfall on slide 8, and we can talk about that. As you'll recall back in last quarter, we
talked about our June CCAR results, where our stress capital buffer increased from 2.5% to 3.4%, and that
increased our overall CET1 ratio minimum requirement from 9.5% to 10.4% as of the beginning of the fourth
quarter.
Our capital levels today remain strong with $176 billion of CET1. And through the good work of our teams, we
improved our CET1 ratio by 49 basis points compared to June 30, taking us to 11%. That leaves us well above
our new 10.4% minimum requirement.
So we'll walk through the drivers this quarter. First, it's $6.6 billion of earnings, net of preferred dividends, and that
generated 40 basis points of capital. And then also importantly through optimization of the balance sheet, we
managed our RWA balances down, and that added 26 basis points more of capital ratio improvement. Dividends
used 11 basis points of capital, and this quarter, the movement in treasury and mortgage-backed securities rates
caused the fair value of our AFS debt securities to decrease, and that lowered our CET1 ratio by 7 basis points.
We remain well-positioned for the rate movement because of the hedge of a large portion of this portfolio
continuing to protect us from AOCI movements, while benefiting NIIs and swap to floating. So, we feel like our
teams rose to the challenge well this quarter in terms of increased capital requirements.
On slide 9, we've laid out average loans, and looking at those loans and providing a bit more detail on a year-
over-year basis, you can see 12% average growth as commercial loans grew 17% and consumer loans grew 7%.
Within consumer, credit card grew 12%.
Focusing on more near-term growth versus the second quarter of 2022, our average total loans grew 8% on an
annualized basis, led by 12% annualized commercial loan growth and 21% annualized credit card growth, while
other consumer loans were relatively flat linked quarter.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2022
This slower linked-quarter growth included two notable impacts that Brian mentioned. We saw good commercial
loan demand, and we also saw FX valuations adjustments as a result of the strong dollar, and then some loan
sales and syndications that lowered our RWAs. Partially offsetting some of the strong card growth in consumer
loans, we sold about $1 billion of residential mortgage loans. Adjusting for the FX impact and loan sales, loan
growth from Q2 was closer to the industry's growth rate.
Let's focus now on deposits using slide 10, and you can see there that our average deposits year-over year are
up 1% at $1.96 trillion. The noninterest-bearing deposits are down 3%, while the interest-bearing are up 4%. So
overall, we grew our deposits, and as you would expect in a rising rate environment, we've seen some shifts from
noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing, and it's important to understand the makeup of these moves.
In Consumer, our total deposits are up 7% year-over-year. These are core and foundational elements of the
customers' financial activities. And we've seen growth in both noninterest-bearing and interest bearing balances,
and we remain very disciplined on $1.1 trillion of total consumer deposits, while fed funds is now at 3.25%. So
customers see the value in their total relationship with us through their personalized client engagement and our
industry-leading digital capabilities and rewards. We expect that to continue.
Do we expect deposit rates to increase? Yes, of course. And we will remain both disciplined and competitive, and
that is built into our asset sensitivity. On a linked-quarter basis, our consumer deposits moved lower by less than
1%.
In wealth management, total deposits are flat year-over-year, and again, it's important to understand that as
expected, these are the clients who generally have more excess liquidity and have historically saw higher rates,
both in deposit accounts, as well as movements outside of deposits, where we offer alternatives for those clients.
While flat year-over-year, within that, we saw a $12 billion decline in year-over-year average deposits on our
brokerage platform, with some shifts from sweeps to preferred deposits within the platform. Meanwhile, Merrill
bank deposits and deposits with Private Bank have grown $12 billion.
The higher-tiered preferred deposit products represent a little more than 20% of the mix of deposits, and they're
moving largely in line with short-term rates, while the other 80% or so deposit products are paying much lower
rates. On a linked-quarter basis, we saw total GWIM deposits decline by 7%, further highlighting these trends.
In Global Banking, we hold about $500 billion in customer deposits and we saw a 7% year-over-year decline. In a
rising rate environment, where excess balances can be more expensive, we typically see some run-off,
particularly in high liquidity environments as clients both use cash for inventory build and begin to manage their
cash for yield. And we've seen the mix of interest-bearing deposits move from 30% a year ago to nearly 35%, and
we're paying an increased rate on those interest-bearing deposits.
Pricing is largely customer by customer, based on the depth of relationship and many other factors. And again,
we're not really seeing anything unexpected here. Betas at this point are still favorable to the last cycle, and as we
would just note, relative to the last cycle, the fed increases have been pretty rapid, and we'd expect to pay higher
rates as we continue to move through this rate cycle. It's probably too early to say right now if at the end of that
cycle, the percentage of those rate pass-throughs will be similar to the last cycle.
Turning to slide 11 and net interest income, on a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q3 was $13.8 billion, and the FTE
NII number was $13.9 billion. Focusing on FTE, net interest income increased $2.7 billion from Q3 2021, or 24%,
and that's driven by benefits from higher interest rates, including lower premium amortization, and from loan

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2022
growth, versus the second quarter, NII is up $1.3 billion, driven largely by the same factors, plus an additional day
of interest in the quarter.
Year-over-year now, average short-term interest rates have increased 200-plus basis points, driving up the
interest earned on our variable rate assets, while we've maintained discipline on our deposit pricing, and that has
driven nearly $1 billion of the improvement.
Long-term interest rates on mortgages have increased even more than short-term rates, and that's improving
fixed-rate asset replacement and driving down refinancing of mortgage assets, therefore slowing the recognition
of premium amortization recognized in our securities portfolio. Year-over-year, that premium amortization has
improved $1 billion. And additionally, lower securities balances over the past six months modestly offset the
benefits of year-over-year loan growth.
But then net interest yield was 2.06% and that improved 38 basis points from the third quarter of 2021. 20 basis
points of that improvement occurred in the most recent quarter, and as you will note, excluding Global Markets
activities, our net interest yield was 2.51% this quarter.
Looking forward, as it relates to NII guidance, I'd like to make a couple comments. And first, I need to make a
couple of caveats. Our guidance is going to assume interest rates in the most recent forward curve and that they
materialize, that we see modest loan growth and modest deposit balance changes with market-based deposit
pricing increasing baked in.
With that said, we expect NII in Q4 to be at least $1.25 billion higher than Q3. So last quarter when we were
together, we told you we expected to see consecutive NII increases of about $1 billion in Q3 and another $1
billion in Q4, and that would make a total of $2 billion then in Q3 and Q4.
Given we've just put up $1.3 billion in Q3 and that outperformance and refreshing our expectation for Q4 at $1.25
billion, we're now saying that aggregate quarterly improvement won't be the $2 billion we initially thought. It's
increased to around $2.6 billion or more.
Turning to asset sensitivity and focusing on a forward yield basis, at September 30, it declined $0.7 billion to $4.2
billion of expected NII over the next 12 months with now roughly 95% of the sensitivity driven by short rates, and
on a spot basis, our sensitivity to 100 basis points instantaneous rate hike would be $5.3 billion.
Okay. Let's turn to expense and we'll use slide 12 for the discussion. Third quarter expenses were $15.3 billion
and were flat with the second quarter as litigation costs for our settlement in Q3 nearly offset the fines agreed to
last quarter on a comparative basis, and it's nice to bring resolution to these matters. Without the costs associated
with the resolutions in both periods, expenses would have been just less than $15 billion.
We continue to make steady investments in our people, technology, marketing, and financial centers, and what
allows us to help pay for these investments are the operational process improvements we've talked about and the
increased digital adoption rates by our customers and by our bankers.
Our head count this quarter increased by 3,500, and if we adjust for the release of our summer interns, our head
count's actually up by closer to 5,500. We welcomed 1,800 new full-time associates from college campuses
around the world into our company this quarter, and we hired another 3,800 net new people on top of that. That
included just less than 3,000 across our various lines of business and another 1,000 in staff and support and

technology positions to support those lines of business. And with all the great benefits and talented people
already at this company and with our great brand, it highlights that Bank of America is a great place to work.
As we look forward, we'd expect our fourth quarter expenses will land our full year reported expense at
approximately $61 billion. That obviously includes the costs noted for resolving the second quarter and third
quarter regulatory and litigation matters, so without that, our expenses are expected to be a little more than the
$60 billion level we talked about earlier in the year. And we're proud of our team's discipline around expense,
particularly in this inflationary environment, while at the same time, we're modestly increasing our level of
investment in the company's future and our growth.
Turning to asset quality on slide 13, and I want to start by saying, just as Brian did, that asset quality of our
customers remains very healthy. The net charge-offs of $520 million declined $51 million from the second quarter.
That decline was driven by prior period charge-offs associated with the sale of some non-core mortgage loans we
discussed last quarter. Absent those losses, net charge-offs were relatively stable with the prior period.
Provision expense was $898 million in the third quarter and that was $375 million higher than the second quarter,
and we built $378 million of reserve in the period compared to a modest release in Q2. The reserve build in the
quarter primarily reflects good credit card loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook.
Even as we build our reserves for the future, this quarter we saw many of our asset quality metrics continue to
show modest improvement as NPLs and reservable criticized both declined from Q2, and you can see that in the
supplement.
On slide 14, we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our Consumer and Commercial portfolios, and there's
only one point I want to make looking at this slide and that is delinquencies, because our Consumer delinquencies
remain well below pre-pandemic levels. And as Brian noted earlier, we're watching closely the early-stage card
delinquencies as they begin to increase modestly.
Lastly, the recent Hurricane Ian impacted some areas where we have strong market shares for many of our
businesses, and our teams have spent the past days assessing the damages and insurance coverage down to
the loan level, and we've already incorporated that analysis into our reserves for the quarter. We compared our
analysis to other large storms in recent years like Sandy, Harvey, and Irma, where we incurred just a small
amount of financial losses.
Turning to the business segments, let's start with Consumer Banking on slide 15. And Brian shared earlier we've
got organic growth across the checking accounts, the card accounts, and investments picking up this quarter, not
necessarily because of anything we're doing differently in the past 90 days, but as a result of many years of
retooling and continuously investing in the business.
We have the leading retail deposit market share. We have leadership positions among all of the important
products. We're the leading digital bank with tremendous convenient capabilities for consumer and small business
clients. We've got a leading online consumer investment platform and the best small business platform offering for
our clients, so as a result, customer satisfaction is now at all-time highs, and that is helping us to drive strong
financial results.
The Consumer Banking earned $3.1 billion on good organic growth and delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of
operating leverage while we continued heavy investments for the future. The impact of strong year-over-year
revenue growth of 12% was partially offset by an increase in provision expense, and the provision increase

reflected reserve builds this period mostly for card growth versus a reserve release in the third quarter of 2021,
our net charge-offs remain low and stable.
While reported earnings were only modestly up year-over-year, pre-tax pre-provision income grew 12% year-
over-year, which highlights the earnings improvement coming through without the impact of the reserve actions.
Card revenue was solid and increased modestly year-over-year as spending benefits were mostly offset by higher
rewards costs.
Service charges were down $338 million year-over-year as our insufficient funds and overdraft policy changes
were in full effect now by the end of Q2. And because of the scale of the business and the diverse revenue, we
fully absorbed that revenue impact and are now benefiting from the benefits of overall customer satisfaction, lower
attrition in our client base, and lower cost associated with fewer customer complaint calls associated with less
nuisance fees.
Expense increased 11% from business investments for growth, including people, digital, and marketing along with
costs related to opening the business to fuller capacity. Much of the company's increased salary and wage moves
in the quarter impact Consumer Banking the most. We also continued our investment in financial centers, opening
another 16 in the quarter, while we renovated nearly 200 more. Both digital banking and operational process
improvements are helping to pay for those investments, and as revenue grew, we've improved the efficiency ratio
to 51%.
Moving to slide 16, wealth management produced strong results, earning $1.2 billion, and that's a particularly
strong result given both equity and bond market levels. If they remain unchanged for the rest of the year, this
would be only the first time since 1976 that both equity and bond markets were down for the year.
Now, the volatility and generally lower markets levels have put pressure on revenue in this business, and what's
helping to differentiate Merrill and the Private Bank right now is a strong banking business, in this case to the tune
of $339 billion of deposits and $224 billion of loans. So while many of our brokerage peers face declines in
revenue and margin, we've seen year-over-year revenue growth of 2% and a margin of 29%, driving the sixth
straight quarter of operating leverage. And we saw enough revenue growth from banking products in Q3 that
more than offset declines in assets under management and brokerage fees.
Our talented group of financial advisors, coupled with our powerful digital capabilities, allowed modern Merrill to
gain 5,200 net new households and the Private Bank gained 550 more in the quarter, both up nicely from net
household generation in 2021. We added $24 billion of loans since Q3 of 2021, growing 12%, and this marked
our 50th consecutive quarter of average loans growth in the business, consistent and sustained performance.
Asset under management flows were $4 billion in the quarter and $42 billion since this time last year. Expenses
increased 2% driven by continued client-facing hiring and higher other employee-related costs as our advisors are
increasing their in-person engagement with clients, and that's partially offset by lower revenue-related incentives.
On slide 17, you'll see our Global Banking results where we earned $2 billion in Q3, on strong revenue growth, as
higher NII more than offset lower noninterest income. Earnings were down year-over-year driven in large part by
the absence of a prior period reserve release. Our 7% revenue growth is quite healthy given the more than 40%
decline in investment banking fees coupled with lower recent revenue.
While the company's overall investment banking fees declined $1 billion year-over-year in a continued tough
market, investment banking fees did improve modestly from Q2 and the teams did a nice job of holding on to our

number three ranking in overall fees in a tough environment. Otherwise, in fees, we saw a decline in corporate
service charges as enterprise credit rates rose with increased rates, and that outpaced the growth in gross
treasury service fees generated from new and existing clients.
I'd also remind you that GTS benefits greatly from the NII off of deposits that more than offsets this, so our year-
over-year total GTS revenue is up 44%. We also had lower leasing-related revenue comparatively. The provision
expense increase reflected a reserve build of $144 million in Q3 2022 compared to a $789 million release in the
year-ago period. And with regard to expenses, they increased 5% year-over-year driven by continued investments
in the business. For example, in commercial banking, our strategic hiring over the years has just continued to
increase our client and prospect calling efforts.
Switching to Global Markets on slide 18, and as we usually do, we'll talk about segment results excluding DVA.
Inflation, continued geopolitical tensions, and the changing monetary policies of central banks around the world
continued to drive volatility in both the bond and equity markets. As a result, it's another quarter that favored
macro trading, while credit trading businesses faced the continued challenging market environment with wider
spreads and recession concerns. So the third quarter of – net income of $1.1 billion reflects a good quarter of
sales and trading revenue.
Focusing on year-over-year, sales and trading contributed $4.1 billion to revenue, improving 13%. FICC improved
27% while equities declined 4%. The FICC improvement was primarily driven by growth in our macro products,
while our credit-traded products were down. And we've been investing heavily over the past year in several macro
businesses that we identified as opportunities for us, and we were rewarded this quarter.
The decline in equities was driven by lower client activity in Asia and a weaker performance in cash, partially
offset by good performance in derivatives where we saw increased client activity. Year-over-year expense
declined reflecting the absence of costs associated with the realignment of liquidating business activity that we
took in the fourth quarter of 2021, and the business generated a 10% return in the third quarter.
Finally, on slide 19, we show All Other, which reported a loss of $281 million, declining from the year-ago period,
driven by the litigation settlement that I noted earlier and higher tax expense. On income tax expense, I just want
to mention one thing that made our tax rate a little higher this quarter, and that is with the recent passage of the
Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, among other things it incorporated, there was a change that allowed solar energy
investments to elect production tax credits versus upfront investment tax credits, and those production tax credits
have the potential to earn more credits over the expected life of the production facility.
So, as a result, our third quarter tax expense is approximately $150 million higher due to the net reversal of tax
credits accrued for 2022 solar deals taken in the first half of 2022 that were recognized under initial investment tax
credits at the time and we replaced with production tax credits. So, a little impact this quarter but net benefit to the
shareholder over time. This drove the effective tax rate a little higher this quarter to more than 14%, still obviously
benefiting from our ESG investment tax credits. And excluding the impact of ESG tax credits, tax rate would have
been approximately 24%.
Given the change noted for solar investments, we expect the fourth quarter tax rate to be similar to the third
quarter tax rate, and we'll examine the further effects of these changes and how they impact full year 2023 and
report on that next quarter.
And with that, I'm going to stop there and open it for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question today from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your
line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey, good morning, guys. Maybe just on NII, I think there's a lot of uncertainty around deposit behavior, betas,
what the catch-up rate could be with deposit pricing, but you guys indicated that you're still pretty asset sensitive,
so how do you think about the trajectory of NII next year? Can it keep growing from sort of the Q4 level through
next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Thanks, Jim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Assuming your forward curve is realized. Sorry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. Yeah. So the short answer is, yes, we believe so, and we believe that really for three reasons. The first one
is we're still expecting future rate hikes and there's going to be some lag to their impact, so you'll start to feel
some of that in Q1, for example, for the late hikes in this quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Second, we're anticipating loans growth is still pretty good at this stage, so we're anticipating that we'll keep
growing on the loan side. And then third, we've got an opportunity to restrike our balance sheet at higher rates
with every opportunity now as things come off of our existing securities portfolio. So, look, we've got our
assumptions in there to be competitive on deposit pricing in each of the various segments. But yes, we believe
we'll grow NII next year.

Yes. Correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Yeah. Okay. And then maybe as a follow-up, you guys have done a pretty great job on hedging AOCI risk in AFS
book. My understanding is that the benefit – those are sort of delayed start swaps. Is there a material benefit
coming from those swaps in the fourth quarter and beyond? How should we think about...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
...that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So just the way our own ALM projected over the course of the next couple years, we had some forward-starting
swaps. Those are going to pay us floating in the fourth quarter, and that's a contributor to the NII growth in the
fourth quarter. But I think you should assume a little bit third quarter, most all in fourth quarter, and that's probably
it.

I just wanted – I wanted to ask a question about expenses. I think part of a bearish thesis on the stock is that
bearish investors expect some sort of expense catch-up relative to how your closest peer – one of your closest
peers is budgeting expenses for not just this year but next year. Heard you loud and clear on the $61 billion plus
the litigation settlement for full year 2022, but as we think about coming years and think about the investments
that you've made, you've highlighted the head count additions in the third quarter. Will the expectation of 1% to
2% expense growth still hold as we look forward, or does inflation and investments change that range upward?

Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So, Erika, we continue to invest heavily along multiple dimensions: people, technology, restructuring all the
physical plant, marketing. And so – but yet through the core operational excellence discipline this company has
and has shown, as I said earlier, seven years later we have the same number of people. The company is a lot
bigger than it was in 2015. And so, we continue to reposition money from things we can eliminate the work by the
engineering and work – and the technology investments we make to enabling the customer's use of that
technology, and plow back into the production side of the company.
And so we don't – I think if you think about this year's third quarter 2022 versus third quarter 2021, you take it out
the litigation, there's about $600 million increase in expenses year-over-year. $100 million of that is marketing.
Another chunk is another couple hundred million dollars technology. This is quarterly, not annual but quarterly
numbers. And then on top of that, the amount of physical plant change in that time is huge, not only in our
branches but all over our company.
So, we feel strong. We continue to increase investments. Technology will go up 15% this year versus – 2023
versus 2020, and those expense numbers we're giving you, but we pay for it by not investing and hoping
something happens. We expect [ph] things to rectify in (00:45:49) near terms and bring forth the fruit and drive
expense efficiencies and effectiveness. And that's how we can take the managers in that time period I gave you
the head count [indiscernible] (00:46:00) came down 10,000 people in that period of time. We invested all in
frontline people to help serve our clients.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And my second question is on more significant buyback activity, Brian. I think that the CET1 build is
certainly coming faster than I think the Street expected. And I'm wondering, do we need to see Bank of America
get to that 11.4% before heavier buyback activity, or do you think you could manage the heavier buyback activity
as you build to that 11.4% CET1 by January 1, 2024?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So we bought back shares this quarter and still grew the capital. Our job is to drive our company to serve our
customers, and that first order of business for our capital is always to help the growth of the balance sheet,
especially on the lending and market side. And so you should expect despite buybacks, we will continue to
increase.
But remember, we are now sitting above what we are supposed to be sitting at on 1/1/2024. And so next year is
already here. So, obviously, the trade between building the buffer up a little bit more, as you said from where we
are now, to 50 basis points over the requirement is a little bit different. We already exceed the requirement, so
we'll put a little bit towards the buffer – we'll support the organic growth a little bit towards the buffer and then use
the rest to send back to you guys.

Operator: We'll go next to Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Thanks very much. I'm curious, half your capital build was thanks to RWA mitigation. You mentioned no loss days
in the quarter despite all this market volatility. You also, I think, mentioned some loan sales. I don't know if that
has to do with some of the levered loans working off book. So, I wonder if you could talk about RWA mitigation
going forward and include in that what's left in the levered loan book to distribute. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So, there's a couple things that are going on there. I don't want to confuse them. Let me first talk about the
leveraged finance thing; that we just marked through our numbers. It's in the numbers. We pushed it through. We
do it every week. So that's included. When you look at those Global Markets or investment banking results, they
include anything we're doing in investment banking.
I don't think that's what Brian was referring to. What Brian was referring to is the RWA optimization that we're
doing as a company to make sure that we're in a great place to serve our customers, and to be in a position to
have the flexibility for buybacks in the future. So, couple things that we did there. We did sell some loans. You
saw that in prior quarters in All Other. You can see some of the legacy loans we were able to sell in prior quarters.
This quarter, we sold $1 billion of loans in Consumer and Wealth, and maybe $1 billion in Global Banking. So it's
not big, but it's important for us just to make progress in different areas. And then most of the RWA optimization,
Glenn, that we've been doing is pretty quiet. It's taking the securities that are 20% risk-weighted asset. And as
they roll off – and remember, there's like $15 billion of them roll off every quarter, we can replace those with
treasuries at a higher yield, so we're getting more yield and we're reducing the RWAs with that.
And then the other thing I'll just say on RWA optimization is we probably tapped the brakes a little bit on loan
production this quarter in a couple places, and we did a little bit of CDS hedging here and there. And you'll see – if
you look at our numbers, you'll also see that Global Markets, just the way that customers are demanding balance
sheet, the balance sheet is still growing, but the RWAs are a little bit lower. So, there's a lot that goes into RWAs,
but it's $1 billion here, $1 billion there, you add it all up and it makes a difference.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
That was awesome. I appreciate that. And I guess, very much related, you just touched on it a little bit, but I'm
curious, you're a prime and super-prime bank in Consumer lend. You gave us enough details. I know how you're
thinking about growth there. On the Commercial side, given what we're all facing in this potential real buzz saw of
an economy, how do you approach risk and what business to take on? I don't know if you could include in that
thought what kind of maturity while you're looking at on the Commercial side of the book. Thank you for all that.
Appreciate it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So, Glenn, what we always say to ourselves and our teammates is that the response of growth across the last
decade plus leads us to where we are, and so you're not going to do anything like this afternoon to change the
impact. Candace and her team have negative growth, not this quarter but the fourth quarter and first couple of

quarters next year, modestly negative growth. You know that you're not going to change your portfolio overnight.
So then the question is, how do you manage it, right?
So we have limits across all the different categories and you can see the spread of risk in the supplemental book.
You can see that nobody is a big part of it. And then we look customer by customer, anticipate who's going to be
needing money in terms of refinancing but also in terms of just operating like we did during the pandemic with
every single loan for the company with $5 million in revenue more in our company on a quarterly basis
[indiscernible] (00:51:46) we had it. So we worked that construct of the book who we underwrite, client selection,
the structures of the deals, et cetera, and the spread of diversity among industries and US versus non-US, et
cetera.
But then on top of that, we always work in the book hard and our ratings integrity is very high. We can see it as
measured in the [indiscernible] (00:52:11) and other things against the third parties, very rare that we have much
to do on anything we have rated and we make sure we test that continuously with our credit review team under
Christine Katziff and Geoff Greener's team because that at the end of the day make sure we're not fooling
ourselves and we continue to look at that.
And frankly, I think this quarter we still had upgrades, exceeded downgrades. If you look at NPLs and reservable
criticized, they both went down this quarter again, and so we're seeing improvement in the credit book even
though all of the parade of horribles that you've sort of alluded to and it wouldn't take a perspicacious person to
read to see that because it's in the paper every day. But right now the credit continues to improve but it's what we
did over the last 12 years, 13 years [ph] that held us in good stead as we head into this year (00:52:57).

Operator: Our next question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Good morning. Thanks. I wanted to ask about the NII assumptions and maybe just your outlook around loan
growth and what you're seeing in the economy, what do you expect from loan growth? You mentioned modest.
And then also, Alastair, just the pace of deposit mix shift and betas that you're kind of building into your outlook
would be helpful. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, on the loan side, I'd say we talked about at the beginning of the year that we thought loans would be high-
single digits, and we've slightly outperformed that obviously. This quarter was a little bit of a 90-day reset for us in
some ways. You didn't see that so much in Consumer because the card growth just came through. In
Commercial, certainly we probably held that back just a touch. So we think we'll resume that sort of high-single
digit maybe mid if things begin to slow a little bit. So we've got that in our forecast we sort of resume the path that
we've been on.
With respect to deposits, I'd say on betas, obviously, we're just increasing those because we've got to be
competitive in this environment. And around balances, I think there's a sense that the industry will be flattish,

maybe down. We think we're going to outperform the industry ever so slightly, so that's what's largely baked into
our assumptions at this stage.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
And in terms of funding that the gap between the loan growth and flattish deposits, securities came down a fair
amount this quarter. Can you continue to rundown the securities portfolio, and what kind of volume do you get
from cash flows off the book there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So the securities portfolio runs off at about $15 billion a quarter. It was a little more this quarter because we
actually had an opportunity to sell some securities that offset some gains, some losses, and freed up some
RWAs. So we took advantage of that this quarter, and so the securities number this particular quarter was a little
larger.
But I think on an ongoing basis, John, you should assume that we've got $15 billion that just comes in, and then
broadly we've got $175 billion of cash at the central bank and we've got another couple hundred billion of stuff
that's mostly treasury swap to floating, so we've got lots of ways to pay for loans growth in the future.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Got it. Okay. Thanks. And if I could just clarify the discussion with Erika around expenses, the $61 billion this year
includes the litigation. Did you say next year you're kind of targeting low-single digit expense growth? Did you say
positive operating leverage?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, I think we said that – yeah, it includes the litigation. And then next year, we said basically – this year
includes litigation, and next year, we said at some point we'll get back to the 1% to 2% rise. We'll just have to see
how some of the ins and outs play in terms of some of the stuff running off this year still left over from the
pandemic.
But you've to look at the $15.3 billion for three quarters in a row. Honestly, each quarter has had a little bit of
something in it. John, if you think about the first quarter where they had the FICO and that type of stuff in it, the
second quarter had the regulatory stuff, and third quarter had litigation. So we're bouncing around low 15s and we
expect that run rate to kind of hold.

Good morning, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. I'd like a little bit more detail on how you add employees and resources for the additional revenues from the
second quarter to the third quarter. Your profit margin on the new revenues was 100%. I mean, revenue was up
$2 billion. Expenses up zero. That's – clearly, that's not sustainable, but I would like you to, if you can, tie that into
slide 22, more digital users and sales, Zelle, Erica, 1 billion interactions. Your head count's not growing a whole
lot. How long can you keep that going, and theoretically, all this digitization over the past few years equates to like
how many employees or how much in expenses or what's a terminal efficiency level relative to the past?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So I think, Mike, that's a lot of questions, but I'll try to sort it out a little bit, starting with the last. There is no
terminal efficiency ratio. Our idea is when you work on expenses you're not working on the ratio. It ends up in a
ratio, but you're working on the actual dollars spent, and so we could keep working on investing heavily to drive
that. And the digitization of all the operational process and the company is what you see on slide 22 on the
Consumer side, and you see it in the other slides in some of the wealth management and Commercial operations,
still a lot of paper in the GTS business that we continue to take out.
So, that's what we're trying to do. But interestingly enough, what's driving the near-term growth in employees has
– there's obviously financial advisor growth. You saw the 400 this quarter. That's investing in the training
programs and hiring some people into the office, especially outside our footprint to get them growing again.
There's investment in commercial bankers. Those are not huge numbers.
The big investment in the GCIB platform over the last year, I think, 1,000 teammates last couple of years, and so
those investments come in. But also, we're investing to drive the operational excellence platform and actually
ensuring that we've got great customer service dealing with all the things that go on. But a major part of it, frankly,
is getting – even though we have less branches year-over-year, less numbers of units, we have more people in
them because we continue to build out the relationship manager capabilities and branches, as you said on page
22, the work goes out of the branches from the day-to-day sort of service things, we're putting more and more in
relationship management and that's why you see 400,000-plus net new checking households this quarter, which
is a record for us going back to pre-financial crisis. We don't know how far back it is.
If you look at small business originations, they are going up. If you look at merchant services sales, which – that
was investment in sales force there and an investment, so it's just a combination of driving that, and the continued
digitization allows us to continue to be efficient, effective, and frankly, plow the money saved back into marketing,
back into more technology and make us even more effective and then into people where we need them.
But Tom Scrivener runs our operations group, sees a lot of stuff ahead of him he can take out, and Bruce
Thompson over the credit operations platform across all of the businesses, a lot they can take out over time, and
we just go work on it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Mike, I think we don't necessarily translate it into that sort of idea of how many more people does digital thing
replace our productivity metrics. But if you look at it by different line of business, if you just take Consumer for a

moment, 50% of our Consumer sales now are taking place digitally. You almost think about that being the
equivalent of 4,000 more financial centers, and it turns out if you give 35 million people banking in their pocket
with a mobile phone, it makes a big difference.

And then just a quick follow-up then. So, Brian, you said before the NII benefits would come barreling through to
the benefit of investors. That was the case this quarter. Do you expect that to continue to be the case over the
next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yes. We said it last quarter, and I hope I proved it true there to what you asked about last quarter. And...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
All right. Thank you. Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Other things, Mike, to think about is if you go back and look at the Consumer page in the deck, you'll see that the
cost of deposits, which is the overall cost of all the stuff against deposit basis continues to basically be 110, 120
basis points, which is down from 300 basis points 15 years ago, and that is extremely leverageable. And by the
way, the profit margin of GWIM is back up to 30% and driving through. So we're letting that NII pull-through which
then drives those numbers up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
One quick follow-up, just I asked this for someone else, they said they didn't really know. The Consumer deposit
betas are outperforming for you and for some others. Why is that outperforming now and do you think that's going
to last?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
The Consumer, if you go to the page on deposits, there's only one. There's a distinguishing fact that goes on in
Consumer that at our company and generally, which really drives up a tremendous value proposition we have to
be the core transaction, core relationship bank for our customers. And if you look at page 10, you can see that the
interest checking, noninterest-bearing accounts, the dollar volume of deposit as a total percentage of deposits are
a very high percentage and that's where we focus on and that allows you – those are zero or very low rates
because the amount of services that come around, I mean, they have access to 3,900 branches, to the call
centers, to the digital platform, to the ability with Zelle payments, et cetera, et cetera, and that's what drives it.
So it's a – the beta is a product of the mix more than it is a product of any pricing strategy, because zero-based –
zero interest – noninterest-bearing checking are zero in any rate environment.

Operator: Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. The capital build was, obviously, faster than expected or at least what most of us have expected
and it doesn't really seem like there was much revenue drag from that. Can you kind of flip the script here and
lean into certain businesses?
And I guess I'm thinking, as we look globally, there's some peers that are needing to build capital. So, maybe
there's some opportunity for further share gains in areas like markets and Global Banking.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. Look, we're in a good position on capital even after the increased stress capital buffer results, which
surprised our industry and our company and we appealed that, as you well know, and didn't get relief, but we
hope it's looked at in the future. But the capital improvement really didn't take much of revenue hit honestly.
The only place we had to be careful on was loan production in the high-end businesses, i.e. GCIB. Other than
that, the markets business has an allocation of the size of balance sheet and capital and RWA, which basically
they were able to achieve all of the results with not even using it up. And Jimmy DeMare and the team do a great
job there. The rest of it – everything else was – there was no real change. And frankly, where we are now, those
changes, that tapping is gone for this quarter already and we're out doing what we should do.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And then, separately, just a little nerdy modeling question. As we think about the timing of the tax credits being
pushed out driving the tax rate slightly higher, is there an offset in that All Other fee line that I think is viewed in
tandem with the tax rate and that you have [ph] few (01:04:43) credits?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So, I would think about it this way, the effective tax rate for Q3 and Q4 likely a little bit higher than our
original guided 10% to 12%, but for the full year, it should end up right around that 12% mark. And then, I'd say
this year, you're right, in the fourth quarter in All Other, we have to take into account the fact that the ESG deals
and their timing. So, I think for your model, Matt, I would use $700 million of an after-tax loss for the fourth quarter
as the most likely. And I'm talking All Other now.
And if you're asking me with respect to the consolidated other income, then I'd use something very similar to the
fourth quarter of 2021 where we had an $800 million pre-tax loss. So, I would just use that there. Okay?

Operator: Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning. Just another – just question or two on fees. Can you just walk us through some of the
deltas in the service charges line, just talk about – I know you had mentioned both the overdraft run ratings,
deposit changes and ECR. Just how much of that is embedded by now and what should we look for going forward
from those areas? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So, Ken, I think with respect to card, kind of flattish as I would think about it right now, a little bit of fourth
quarter seasonal maybe. That should benefit there. Service charges, most importantly on the consumer side, all
the NSF/OD were now at the steady-state run rate. So, that won't be hurting us again from this point forward.
The commercial part, you're right to highlight, but the commercial business, the GTS business is adding clients.
We're doing more with clients. So, that's adding gross fees, but many of the clients prefer that earnings credit
adjustment as the way that they essentially pay interest, receive interest and then pay fees. So, that came down
probably $150 million in this quarter. I think you should expect that to come down again next quarter, just with the
way rates are going.
And then, the other fees are probably pretty straightforward. Wealth will be all about market levels with a one-
month lag based on where the markets are. Investment banking, kind of flattish I would think, maybe hoping for a
little bit of positive at some point, but not necessarily this quarter. And then, sales and trading, your guess is as
good as ours, but that we generally point to the sort of 15% seasonality in Q4 compared to Q3 and we're coming
off of, obviously, a pretty good period.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Let me – Ken, just one of the things I think, it goes a little bit to Mike's point, a little bit to some of the other points,
is that about 80-odd percent, if I got exact – I think it's 84% if I got it right, of the interchange goes back to the
customer base in terms of rewards products either directly through our own rewards programs or through some
affinity group programs. So, obviously, as charges go up, a fair amount of that goes back.
Now, what does that produce in value? It produces incredible value. So, a lot of that in our Preferred Rewards fee
structure which go – the rewards structure which goes across all products in our company, if you even just look at

the preferred segment and why deposit pricing and the stability of our accounts is different than peers through the
last cycle, we'll see what happens this time, is that that rewards structure cements the customer relationship. And
so, that then has a 99% retention rate plus of those preferred customers who have about 80% all the deposits on
a consumer segment and they are very stable important customer base as all our customer bases are.
So, you have to think through on those fees. We're effectively investing in those fees in the duration of customer
base, the length of customer base, the profitability of customer base, the stability of customer base and the fact
that then we can net produce a lot more customers because we're not having to replace the run-off.
And so, as you see, so many fee lines, same with NSF/OD by doing what we've done, the attrition rate has
obviously dropped to the floor and you're seeing more production of net accounts there. And these are all related
to total revenue per customer, profit per customer, as opposed to any individual decision.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great. Thanks for all that color. I got just one separate question on you mentioned that this credit continues to
improve, and you're seeing some underlying. Can you just work us through, just to remind us, just where you are
in terms of your scenarios from a CECL perspective, and if the economy does in fact change, how weighted are
you already to an already worsening scenario?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So, this quarter, very similar to last quarter, we use blue chip consensus as our baseline. You're talking 50
different economists, some of whom are in the middle, some of whom are pessimistic themselves, some of whom
are more optimistic. That's 60%. That's the baseline.
The other 40% is downside scenarios that we build. And there, that's the weighting then we're applying. And in
this particular quarter, just to give you an idea, Ken, once again, we increased our forecast for inflation in that
scenario. We increased unemployment in that scenario. And we decreased GDP through the course of the next
couple years. So, all of that – that's a few quarters now in a row where that pattern is continuing, and we did it
again this quarter and we'll just keep adjusting that over time based on the macroeconomic situations that
develops over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yes. Alastair, just to give a sense though, it's a 5% unemployment like now and then continues all the way
through next year. So there's an inherent conservatism built into that reserving level. Our reserve in there is
60%/40% and has those kinds of statistics around, so whether – it has inflation, but more importantly it's based on
kind of that unemployment level which is 150 basis points over where we are. And we are in October, so it would
be pretty quick to move to the 5% at the end of the year.

Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Thanks. Just a couple of questions, Brian and Alastair. [ph] How loan marks (01:11:43) a quick one, how much
were those in the third quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So, we didn't call that out, Vivek, just for the simple reason it was smaller this quarter. We run those through the
P&L every week, as you know. So the results that you see in Global Markets and investment banking did include
them last quarter. We called it out last quarter because it was just bigger. But this quarter, we didn't feel that we
needed to.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Brian, you talked about tech spend being up, if I caught it correctly, 15% in 2023. Is that right? And if so,
what's the dollar amount of tech spend that you're expecting in either this year or next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
This year, we are around $3.3 billion. Next year we move up 15% of it, $3.4 billion or something like that so...

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2022
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, we're obviously modeling in probably the same thing you are. We're going to have to price competitively for
deposits in an environment where, obviously, market-based expectations are changing every day. So, we're
anticipating it's going to be a little bit tougher from this point forward, but that's already baked into our NII.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I guess to get more precise, Alastair, since you have better resources and better data than we do, what betas –
where do you expect betas to get to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, that's going to differ by customer base. And I don't want to get into this on this call, just because it's
competitively important for us, obviously. But you can assume that at the higher end of wealth, for example, I
shared that we're passing through most of that at this stage. That's going to be very different versus our
noninterest-bearing accounts. It will be different for operational versus non-operational and commercial. So, betas
will be in quite different places, but I'm anticipating that they will just continue to drift up over time.

Operator: We'll go next to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi, just a couple of questions. One is on how we think about comp going into next year. We've got this inflation
rate that's obviously – seems higher for longer and while we expect it comes down over the next 12 months,
you're going into the year with it at a pretty high level, and social security is even going up like 8% as we all know.
So, wondering how you think about that. You've done a great job at being on the front foot with regard to minimum
wage increases in your shop. So, should we expect more of that to come into next year's expense guide as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So I think, Betsy, the last several months, we've done the fifth share success program. We did our usual
merit, we did a 3%, 5%, and 7% merit increase for everybody under $100,000 in compensation based on years of
service. We've accelerated a $22 starting wage, which is 40-odd thousand dollars a year now, and we'll continue
those patterns.
And the good news is we're seeing the attrition rate move, start to move back. It was 12%, dropped to 6%, moved
back up to 15-ish, and has now dropped down to low-14s. And each month, it starts to drop even more. So we
feel that we've got the right mix, and we all look at benefits continuously. We continue to – [indiscernible]
(01:15:48) we increased our childcare benefit to $275 per month per child, increased our tuition reimbursement
and did it in advance.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2022
And so, it's a complex package, but we have been able to absorb all that and keep expenses bounce along at
$15.3 billion a quarter for the last three or four quarters and we'll continue to do that, and that's where it comes
down to also using the technology investments and operational excellence investments to continue to reduce the
aggregate number of people we have working, and pay those talent teammates we have even more while they
work.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. So, expectation for that to persist, meaning flat expenses year-on-year as we go into 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. We've said that we'd start growing in the 1% to 2% category, and that's part of these types of inflationary
things that you're mentioning, which are higher now and then working it down over time. And so right now, we're
running in the low $15 billion per quarter, $15.3 billion, and we expect it to maintain and grow.
But most of that growth does come, as you're saying, into the compensation. And it ebbs and flows where it goes
on a given – when the markets are driving more investment banking markets and wealth management, and those
come down a little bit and the other compensation comes up as we've changed base pay and things like I talked
about. But it's just – it's 214,000 people, it's a very complex discussion all over the world. So there's no one
answer for the whole team.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah, I get that. Okay. Thanks. And that's helpful color. Just one other one, Alastair, you mentioned the securities
roll-off that you've been able to mix shift towards a higher yield over time. Can you give us a sense as to what
kind of pull to par we should be thinking about for the model on the AOCI hits that you've had to take, how many
quarters or years should we be thinking that gets erased over?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So I'd say on the treasuries, generally speaking, if you just think about the duration there being somewhere
between four and five years, and on the mortgages, it's probably seven to eight, so it takes a while to pull to par.
And then there'll be some derivatives as well. And I think the team can probably help you model that at some
point, but those are broadly speaking about the numbers I would use.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Good morning, Gerard.

Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi, Brian. Hi, Alastair.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Hi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Alastair, you touched on there is some early-stage delinquencies in the consumer book and not so much with the
hurricane, but can you give us any color – and your numbers are obviously very strong, but can you give us some
color of what you're seeing there? Is it a lower FICO score customer? Anything you can read into it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alastair Borthwick A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
This is one of the things, Gerard, you have to be careful of because obviously when a person doesn't pay you, the
FICO is going down de facto. So, [ph] Gerard (01:19:13), the origination statistics we put in the back of the deck
there are very strong, remain strong and what we're seeing is – I gave you the five-year averages, which will still
far exceed where we are today and we're still lower pre-pandemic.
So, even though we're ticking back up the word "normalization," I ask people to be careful with, because we're
moving back to what was all-time lows and we're not even there. So, I think if you look in the auto business, the
number of repossessions and stuff is down half on a monthly basis. So, we built – under responsible growth, we
built a book in the consumer side that we knew would be durable through different modeled outcomes which is
what we do in the stress testing and what we do in the reserve setting process and stuff, but also through actual
outcomes and what you're seeing is it's weathering any notion of issues in the economy well now. And then, on
the commercial book, as we said, we still see upgrades exceeding downgrades.
The simple way to think about it is I think we're – through the P&L provision cost, with flat reserve build, pre-
pandemic was basically $1 billion a quarter. We're running around that number now and that's building $400
million of reserves, it's a little different constitution and that means unless charge-offs tick up, you're going to see
the reserve builds start to mitigate, because sort of we're sitting there with a pretty conservative scenario now and
it'll all depend on that as we look forward. But remember the baseline is now baking in effectively a recession
based on the blue chip.

Gerard, I think, too, if you went back through our supplement over the course of the past 10 years, you're going to
find these numbers are so low. Like we're squinting to see a change here and it's coming off of really historically
extraordinary numbers. So, is there a little bit of movement? Yes. But is it the second best of all time? Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. Very good color. Can I follow up on the provision? Brian, you just mentioned about the $1 billion in the
past? If you took that worst – you guys I think said 60%, 40%, in terms of your reserve build in terms of the base
case on the economy versus a really difficult economy, if that really difficult economy went to 100%, what type of
provision on a quarterly basis would that push up to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. I mean I think we have that, but remember that I'd be careful about that, because basically the baseline
now has built into it a fairly weak forward path in the near term. And so, I wouldn't speculate exactly the numbers,
but if you saw it would build a bunch of reserves with a 15% unemployment and [ph] projection that debt was
going to go on whatever like it (01:22:05) was in the pandemic and you saw us move up, but we're sitting closer to
what we called CECL day one and pandemic implementation, then you can see some of that in the stress test.
So we don't really speculate on that, but we have on stress test to test it to make sure and you can see the Fed
stress test and the adverse case you can see the numbers frankly which I don't think would ever materialize given
what you do in the period of time between then and there, but that gives you some sense if you look at those
[indiscernible] (01:22:32).

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 17-Oct-2022
Brian T. Moynihan
Chair & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Okay. Well, thank you for all your questions and your attention. Let me just summarize for the third quarter 2022,
you saw responsible growth in action once again. We had organic growth in all businesses. We had top line
revenue growth driven by the NII increases. We had strong expense control, flat expenses for the third straight
quarter, operating leverage for the fifth straight quarter and good work on that. We had good risk management.
You can see that we're still running strong risk parameters and we built the capital to the end state 1/1/2024 levels
that we need. So, that's what we call responsible growth and now you're seeing it in action. Thank you.
