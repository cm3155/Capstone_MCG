Q1 2023 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2023
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Phil.

Phillip D. Green
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thanks, A.B., and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Today, I'll review first quarter results for
Cullen/Frost and our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas, will provide additional comments and then we're going
to open up for your questions.
In the first quarter, Cullen/Frost earned $176 million or $2.70 per share compared with earnings of $97.4 million or
a $1.50 per share reported in the same quarter last year. That represents an increase of 80%. That's 8-0% over
last year's level. Our return on average assets and average common equity in the first quarter were 1.39% and
22.59%, respectively, and that compares with 0.79% and point – excuse me, and 9.58% for the same period last
year. I'm extremely proud of this performance, and I believe that it helps demonstrate the value of Frost's culture,
the excellence of our people, and the soundness of our institution.
These results are a product of our commitment to our philosophy, which our late former Chairman, Tom Frost,
captured years ago in our 21-word mission statement, which reads, we will grow and prosper, building long-term
relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets. Never have those
words rung truer. Our commitment to this mission produces tangible results like we just reported, and it is
reflected in factors such as: our commitment to sound liquidity, which resulted in our going into March with 20% of
our deposit base held in a checking account at the Federal Reserve. This not only serves to protect depositors, it
also allowed us to take direct benefit from Federal Reserve interest rate increases as they continued to fight
inflation. By sharing these benefits with our depositors throughout this upward rate cycle, I'm convinced we've
built not only balances but also trust with our deposit customers.
To have a level of bank deposits generally been impacted by these higher rates and the Fed's quantitative
tightening, of course, they have. Remember, our deposits peaked in August of last year. Did most banks see
movement by some nervous depositors last month in the wake of the failure of some specialized banks? Of
course they did. But keep this in mind. Frost did not take on any federal home loan bank advances. We did not
participate in any special liquidity facility or government borrowing. We did not access any wholesale funding, and
we did not utilize any reciprocal insurance arrangements to build insured deposit percentages.
And while lending out only 41.5% of our deposit base at quarter end, we continued to provide consistent capital to
our customers and communities by growing our average loan portfolio over the year by 7.5%, in line with our high-
single digits target. We also continued to successfully execute our focus on organic expansion in major Texas
markets. For example, our Houston expansion, including the original 25 location build-out, plus the partial
completion of three additional locations in what we call Houston 2.0, continue to mature and exceed pro formas,
with a 115% of our household goal, 169% of our loan goal, and 102% of our deposit goal. I'll add that in a
moment, Jerry will share some insights into the financial impact from the maturing Houston expansion. In addition,
our Dallas expansion just reached the halfway mark this week and currently stands at 228% of our new
household goal, 282% of our loan goal and 318% of our deposit goal.
Now, taking a closer look at the quarter, our consumer business continues to perform extremely well. In fact, the
first quarter represented an all-time high for net new customers, up 26% from the first quarter of last year. Even
more impressive to me was the fact that for the month of March, we exceeded our previous all-time monthly
record for net new consumer customers by 33%. That's over 1,000 more customers than our previous record. Our
bankers are busy.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2023
Looking at this increase in new customer growth, it was led by Dallas and Houston, our two expansion markets,
which accounted for 75% of this household growth. Houston was up 33% and Dallas was up 133%. And even our
headquarters market of San Antonio saw net new household growth in March of 14%.
Average consumer deposit balances for the first quarter declined 1.4% from the fourth quarter of last year, as
customers continued to spend excess balances and take advantage of significantly higher rate opportunities.
Most of that decline was in our consumer checking balances, which was partially offset by increases in consumer
CD balances as customers took advantage of our highest available rates. But I think it's important to note that
looking at the period March 10 to April 14, consumer checking balances were actually up 1.3%.
Consumer loan growth ended the quarter at $2.45 billion or 28% higher than the first quarter of last year, driven
by consumer real estate as our home improvement and home equity products continue to be the right product at
the right time for customers with low-rate first mortgages. Credit continues to be excellent, with average credit
scores exceeding 750.
Our new mortgage pilot program continued to originate loans for employees, and we're very pleased with the
experience we've been able to provide. We look forward to rolling the product out to the market when we begin
offering it initially in our Dallas region later in the second quarter.
Looking at our commercial business, it's clear that even as our volumes increased 4.1% in the same quarter a
year ago, the increases in interest rates by the Fed are having their intended effect of slowing the rate of growth
for commercial activity, particularly in the commercial real estate sector.
I'm pleased with our prospecting efforts in the market as we increased our number of calls by 24% over the fourth
quarter. That resulted in a linked quarter 25% increase in the dollar amount of prospect deals we looked at. And
we actually booked 50% more prospect dollars for this same period. However, we saw the dollars of customer
deals we looked at and booked both fall by around 35% for the same period. And this was reflected particularly in
a 52% decline in the dollar value of customer CRE deals we looked at and a 66% decline in the dollar value of
customer CRE deals booked. It shouldn't be a surprise that commercial real estate activity is moderating in this
rate environment.
Looking forward, our dollar volume of total new opportunities in our pipeline is up 26% from the end of 2022. And
looking out at just the next 90 days, the gross pipeline is up 17% from year end. But when probability weighted by
our loan officers, it looks pretty flat. So I'd have to say I'm seeing some mixed signals in the tea leaves and we'll
just have to see how it turns out.
While I can say definitively is that between March and April, average loans are up $192 million, so to this point,
we're still seeing decent growth. Credit quality continues to be strong by historical standards. Problem loans,
which we define as risk grade 10 or higher, were $347 million at quarter end, down $100 million or 22.4% from the
first quarter of last year, and up $25 million from our year-end level.
Non-performing loans were $39.1 million at quarter end, down 22.9% from a year ago and flat from the previous
quarter. Charge-offs for the quarter were $8.8 million, up $2.5 million from the first quarter of last year and
represented an annualized 21 basis points of average loans.
Now, regarding commercial real estate, as we noted last quarter, overall, our commercial real estate portfolio
metrics continue to indicate good operating performance across all asset types with acceptable debt service

coverage ratios and loan to values. Total CRE commitments were $10.9 billion at quarter end with $8.3 billion
funded and outstanding.
Within this portfolio, what we would consider to be the major categories of investor CRE, things like office,
multifamily, retail and industrial as examples, total $4.7 billion or 43% of CRE commitments. Our investor CRE
portfolio has held up well, exhibiting an overall average loan to value of about 55% and loan to cost of about 61%
and acceptable reported debt service coverage ratios.
Higher interest rates have certainly led to some decline in coverage ratios and will probably lead to some
valuation declines, but we're starting from a strong position with good cushion. Specifically, in the office building
portfolio, which is top of mind in the current environment and including medical office, we have about $2.4 billion
committed and $2.2 billion outstanding with about half of that being owner occupied buildings. We consider owner
occupied properties to have a lower risk profile due to reliance on our C&I borrowers' operating cash flow rather
than income generated from underlying real estate. And borrowers in our C&I portfolio have held up very well as
we operate in some of the strongest markets in the United States.
The investor office portfolio exhibited an average loan to value of 55% and an average debt service coverage
ratio of 1.35 at current interest rates, again, starting from a strong position with cushion for potential valuation
declines. Our comfort level with our office portfolio continues to be based on the character and experience of our
borrowers and sponsors, the predominantly Class A nature of our office building projects, and the fact that 83% of
the exposure is associated with stabilized projects that are 87% leased. It also helps be operating in Texas.
Finally, I'm happy to report we learned in the first quarter that for the seventh year in a row, Frost had received the
highest number of Greenwich Excellence and Best Brand Awards of any bank in the nation. The Greenwich
Awards are given for providing superior service, advice and performance to small business and middle market
banking clients.
In addition, we learned that for the 14th year in a row, Frost had received the highest ranking in customer
satisfaction in the J.D. Power US Retail Banking Satisfaction Study for Texas. None of these accomplishments
would be possible without our outstanding staff always striving to go above and beyond to make people's lives
better. They made it all happen and I'm immensely proud of them and our great company.
Now, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas, for some additional comments.

Jerry Salinas
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thank you, Phil. I wanted to start off first by talking a little bit about our Houston expansion results. As a reminder,
we announced our planned initial 25-branch expansion in Houston in 2018. The last of those branches, which we
refer to as Houston 1.0, was opened in 2021. So these branches are still in what I would call the development
stage. We've been very pleased with the volumes we've been able to achieve as we've mentioned previously in
some of these calls.
Looking at the first quarter, linked quarter annualized growth in average balances for these locations was 29% for
deposits and 30% for loans. Also, I'm happy to say that Houston 1.0 is now profitable as those branches earned
approximately $1.4 million pre-tax in the month of March or $0.02 a share after tax, and we would expect that
their performance will continue to improve.

Now, moving to our net interest margin, our net interest margin percentage for the first quarter was 3.47%, up 16
basis points from the 3.31% reported last quarter. Higher yields on both balances held at the Fed and loans had
the largest positive impact on our net interest margin percentage. The increase was also positively impacted to a
much lesser extent by a higher yield on investment securities. These positive impacts were partially offset by
higher costs on both deposits and repurchase agreements and the impact of lower balances held at the Fed.
Looking at our investment portfolio, the total investment portfolio averaged $21.7 billion during the first quarter, up
$1.6 billion from the fourth quarter average, as we continued to deploy some of our excess liquidity during the
quarter. We made investment purchases during the quarter of approximately $2.1 billion, which included $1.7
billion in agency MBS securities with a yield of 5.02% and $390 million in municipal securities with a taxable
equivalent yield of about 5.01%.
During the first quarter, we sold about $1.2 billion in investment securities, about $900 million in municipals, and
about $300 million in agency MBS securities as we took advantage of market dislocation, which allowed us to
improve interest income going forward. We recognized a net gain of about $21,000 on those transactions.
The net unrealized loss on the available for sale portfolio at the end of the quarter was $1.4 billion, an
improvement of $260 million from the $1.7 billion reported at year-end. The net unrealized loss on the held to
maturity portfolio at the end of the quarter was $110 million, down $61 million from year-end. The taxable
equivalent yield on the total investment portfolio in the first quarter was 3.24%, up 15 basis points from the fourth
quarter.
The taxable portfolio, which averaged $13.3 billion, up approximately $1.3 billion from the prior quarter, had a
yield of 2.67%, up 26 basis points from the prior quarter, impacted by the higher yields on recently purchased
agency MBS securities. Our tax exempt municipal portfolio averaged about $8.4 billion during the first quarter, up
about $293 million for the fourth quarter and had a taxable equivalent yield of 4.23%, up 6 basis points from the
prior quarter. At the end of the first quarter, approximately 73% of the municipal portfolio was pre-refunded or
PSF-insured. The duration of the investment portfolio at the end of the first quarter was 5.5 years, down from 5.8
years at the end of the fourth quarter.
Looking at deposits, on a linked quarter basis, average deposits were down $2 billion or 4.5%, with about two-
thirds of the decrease coming from non-interest bearing deposits and one-third coming from interest-bearing
deposits.
I want to talk a little bit more about our non-interest-bearing deposits, which totaled $16 billion at the end of the
quarter, with 96% of that amount being commercial demand deposits. Related to these commercial DDAs, I had
mentioned previously that this category was the most at-risk given the high interest rate as commercial treasurers
and CFOs were beginning to focus on those balances as any balances above amounts needed for normal
transactional operational amounts were not earning any interest. When rates were at or near zero, that was not a
big deal. But as rates started to go up, we had seen some reduction in our DDA balances that began in the
September-October timeframe, and we mentioned those balances were the most at-risk and we suspected that
those balances would continue to decrease, which they have.
These decreases did not accelerate after the bank failures in March. The decrease in the monthly average
balance from January to February was $538 million. The average balance then decreased $301 million between
February and March. And into April, the average balance is down $492 million from the March average. These
decreases have not been unusual and were not unexpected.

Looking at total interest-bearing deposits, they've been pretty stable during the period. At the end of December,
they stood at $26.4 billion and decreased $167 million to end the quarter at $26.2 billion. The average balance for
both the month of March and April month-to-date is $26.1 billion, so basically flat during this time period.
Customer repos for the first quarter averaged $4.2 billion, up $636 million from the $3.6 billion average in the
fourth quarter as we saw some deposit flows into our repo product during the quarter. The cost of interest-bearing
deposits for the quarter was 1.52%, up 36 basis points from the fourth quarter.
Looking at non-interest income on a linked-quarter basis, so I just wanted to point out a couple of items. Trust and
investment management fees were down $3.6 million or 8.9%, driven by decreases in estate fees of $2.1 million,
real estate fees of $667,000, and oil and gas fees down $449,000. Estate fees and real estate fees can fluctuate
based on the number of estates settled or properties sold, respectively. Insurance commissions and fees were up
$7.3 million or 62% from the fourth quarter, driven by higher property and casualty contingent bonuses, up $3.1
million; benefits commissions, up $2.8 million; and live commissions, up $1.2 million, which those live
commissions contend to be kind of choppy.
As a reminder, the first quarter is typically our strongest quarter for insurance revenues given we typically
recognize contingent income in that quarter and also impacted by our natural business cycle. The second quarter
is typically our weakest quarter for insurance revenues, again impacted by our normal renewal business volumes.
Other income was down $4.9 million from the fourth quarter, primarily due to a $5.1 million distribution received
from an SBIC investment in the fourth quarter last year.
Regarding 2023 expenses, looking at our full-year projection of expenses for 2023, as we mentioned last quarter,
we currently expect total non-interest expense for the full year 2023 to increase at a percentage rate in the mid-
teens over our 2022 reported levels. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 15.7% or about 15.9%
excluding discrete items. Our current expectation is that our full-year effective tax rate for 2023 should be in the
range of about 15% to 16%, but that can be affected by discrete items during the year.
Regarding the estimates for full year 2023 earnings, our current projections include a 25 basis point Fed rate
increase in May, followed by a 25 basis point decrease in September, November and December. Given those rate
assumptions and our expectation of 2023 non-interest expense growth, we currently believe that the current mean
of analysts' estimates of $9.79 is reasonable.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Phil for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions]
[Operator Instructions] Today's first question is coming from Steven Alexopoulos of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi, everybody.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Hey, Steven.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Morning, Steven – afternoon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Sorry – yeah, good afternoon. I wanted to dig a bit deeper into the decline in non-interest bearing and period-end
deposits. Can you help us understand how those trended? It sounds like it was pretty normal, but I just want to
dive a little bit more into this, how those trended through what we saw from Silicon Valley Bank and Signature.
What did you guys see in that aftermath where most banks saw a fairly substantial reduction in the uninsured
deposits?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Really from a fluctuation standpoint, the – those balances as you would expect and as I talked about, we've kind
of seen a downward trend starting back in September, October. And yet I don't think that during those days with
SVB that that I would have said, hey, it really looks more unusual than it had the week before, let's say, we were
already on that downward sort of trend. Obviously, we're paying a lot of attention to it. And you can tell by the
averages, they were down. But yeah, I'm not going to say – I'm sure there was some concern, so it's not like we
have our head in the sand. But I don't think it's been anything significant. Like I said when I mentioned the
average balances, that's really what I was trying to give a little bit of color that really in March, as you would
expect, that was pretty early on at the 10th, let's say, but say so that was the first third of the month and the
balances between February and March weren't that much lower. We've seen them continue to decrease in April
like I said and some of that obviously can get affected by tax payments as well.
And I'll take a little step back and say, pre-COVID for us, typically what would happen is that our deposits would
tend to peak in December. A lot of the corporate customers would do a window dressing, as we called it. And so
those balances would tend to decrease – excuse me, increase in December, and then as we went into the first
quarter, those balances would begin to decrease into the first quarter and end through April and with tax
payments and such and then would pick up in the tail end of the year. So some of it is natural trend based on
what some of the corporate customers have done historically. But I wouldn't say that we saw a significant – I'm
sure there were some downward movement. But just quoting the numbers I mentioned regarding average

balances, I don't think it was really anything that caught a lot of our attention. Obviously, we were paying attention.
There were a lot of conversations going on between our customers and our bankers. Customers were reaching
out to them and we were having good conversations. But I don't think it was anything that I would say, gosh, on
day X, those deposits were down $3 billion or something like that [indiscernible] (00:28:36). We never saw any
sort of a decrease that I would say was beyond a reasonable band.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, Steven, I might just add that really the – seeing anybody that looked like they were concerned of any size
was notable and there was so little of it, I'd say less than one hand that I heard about. And I think our experience
was that – when you talk to people, they were okay. I think it's indicative of our relationship model and that our
customers didn't really consult social media. They consulted our bankers. And we had lots of calls. And I think
early on, we were calling customers more than we were getting calls. So, I agree to Jerry. It was – and that was
certainly a time everyone was paying attention, and you were – want to make sure you're communicating, people
had the best information and that if you saw anything that was sort of not quite right, reported that – you could
address it, and then everybody would be equipped. But I'm really proud of our customer base. I think it was really
indicative of the relationships and really trust that people had in Frost.

Steven Alexopoulos Q

You're one of the few banks that didn't see substantial outflows on that Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday after
[indiscernible] (00:30:08) so kudos to you guys on that front.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
On the net interest margin, Jerry, I thought you said last quarter it was also assuming that rates went up I think
one more, and then there were several cuts. You said you thought the NIM would peak in the third quarter. I'm
curious if the Fed goes one or two more times, but then holds rates at that level through the end of the year, how
does that change the trajectory of NIM that you would expect?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I think some of the moving pieces as we continue to talk about is what happens to this commercial DDA. I
think our expectations there – let me start with that is that I mentioned that the April volume is down from March.
And so, we expect, based on what we're seeing and conversations with those customers, that we'll begin to really
settle into the low point in the second quarter and start to see in the – yeah, going forward an increase.
And I'm not talking about a significant increase, maybe stabilization might be a better word than increases starting
in the second half of the year. So, if in your scenario, I guess I'll stop in a second and say so, one thing that is not
affecting us today as much is that we, for modeling purposes, have assumed that we won't make any more
investment purchases this year. And the reason we took that out of the model was more given all the noise and
concerns about liquidity and all the questions that were coming up, we just appreciated the flexibility we could

give ourselves if we took that out of the assumptions. Now, I'm not saying we won't buy anything, but it's good to
have that built into our base that should we see something opportunistically, we can take advantage.
So, we're going to be under – in a higher rate environment, we're going to be in a little bit of a lower sort of
operating performance standpoint because we're not going to be investing at what you might expect might be
higher rates. And again, some of this is going to be dependent also on deposit betas. I think we right now feel
pretty good on our deposit cost, what we're paying our depositors. We're being a little bit more aggressive on our
CDs. It's something that we really want to make sure that we're helping our customers make one decision and the
decision being that they want to bank with Frost and so, being a little bit more aggressive there.
So, I think those are the two things that potentially could have an impact on the net interest margin. So, in our
scenario, we project one, a NIM that's relatively flat for the rest of the year. Again, a lot of it is going to be
dependent on what happens with those demand deposits. But in a scenario where I've got one rate increase, I
think you said no cuts, but maybe another increase after that, I think what we project is for any 25 basis point
increase roughly, we would expect about [ph] $1.3 million (00:33:16) pre-tax improvement in net interest income,
if that kind of helps you out there.

Yeah, that's very helpful. If I could sneak one last one in just on liquidity, where did cash level then on a period

Yeah, we were – I think Phil may have said in his comments. At the end of the quarter, we were 20% of deposits,
is kind of where we ended up and the number that I'll give it to you as of today, I think we were at little shy of $6.9
million.

Jerry Salinas A

I guess it's going to – that's the – the big question is deposit flows. Right now, we don't have any assumptions for
investment purchases. We'll certainly expect that we'd get some cash flow from the investment portfolio with just
maturities and such. And I think loan growth, as Phil said, we expect loan growth to be at that high-single digit. So

that's not going to have a big impact on cash balances. So, we – yeah, I think all things being equal, we could be
in this ballpark for the rest of the year.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. I was wondering can you talk about some of the strategies to reduce some of the asset sensitivity in light
of the forward curve and your outlook for some rate cuts?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well. I think before – if we just talk about asset sensitivity and reducing it, we said for some time that there are
really three things that we look at as providing some measure of protection. We are asset sensitive And so, that's
– we can't obviate that totally. But the three things are if we were willing to lock in some of the rates by extending
on the yield curve out from the daily Fed balance that we're maintaining. So, that's one thing.
And the second thing is that because we've done so much work increasing our deposit rates over time, really
beginning with the cycle of rate increases, we've got built-in capacity to respond to rate reductions in the event
they happen, we can lower those down, so that helps. And then the third thing that we've got really in our
business is what are business volumes going to do and are we able to continue to grow organically and post good
numbers there. The outlook looks good, but we'll just have to see what happens there. And so, that's the third
piece of it.
And there – I will say that with regard to hedging program, that type of thing, we continue to look at those for
opportunities. It's been our position that those have been – we really don't see value in there vis-à-vis cash
markets or other things. And so, we really haven't availed ourselves of that. We continue to look at that and they
may be a part of what we do if we feel like there's opportunity there for the company and for shareholders. So,
that's really our perspective on it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. And you mentioned that you're still comfortable with the high-single digit loan growth. And I'm just
wondering, in this environment, we've been hearing that certain lenders are pulling back or tightening underwriting
standards. Do you think there's going to be opportunities for you guys to take market share just given the strength
of your balance sheet and strong capital?

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2023
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Peter, that's a great question. We were actually talking about this morning. That's a little bit of a wild card. I would
say, well, I don't see it definitely in our pipeline numbers yet. I hear about it anecdotally and I'm aware of some
deals where banks were not able to complete a transaction that they had offered on the same terms and we
ended up getting some of those.
My gut tells me that's going to happen more. What we're going to have to do though, is we're going to have to be
prudent and careful in the deals that we're seeing, particularly in the commercial real estate space, because
developers – and our customers tell us that it's easier to get equity than it is to get debt capital these days. And so
you can imagine cell phones ringing a lot. And we don't do transactions. We bank people and we have long-term
relationships. So, we've got to be really prudent and taking advantage of that. I think there'll probably be a little –
maybe a little bit less of that in the C&I space. I hope not. I really would love to expand the C&I business because
it's the long term. It's got a long sales cycle, but it's very profitable. And – so let's hope, and I think that is the wild
card right now as we move through the rest of this year. We see banks that are [indiscernible] (00:38:53) their
horns because of liquidity issues, we could see a little bit of – a little bit of growth there.

So, expense growth has been mid-teens for the last – well, it was last year you're expecting it to be this year. I
know some of that is driven by what has happened in Dallas and in Houston. But when you think about longer
term expense growth, what is the right level there? I'm guessing it's somewhere back in the mid- to high-single
digit level.

Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. Just as a reminder, I think it was driven primarily by what you mentioned. We're obviously introducing our
new mortgage product and the impact of the expansions. But in addition, we talked last quarter about the fact that
we were making a significant investment in IT this year. So, just as a reminder on kind of what's driving the
expense growth. Yeah, I would say that in a in a more normalized environment as we're expecting for next year, I
would think that your comment about high-single digits is what I would expect at this point.

Brady Gailey Q

Hey, Jerry, maybe I missed it. Did you give a number for where DDAs or if non-interest-bearing deposits ended
the quarter? And give a sense of your expectations around that mix given – as you said, you expected these
customers to move excess funds out if we get the last rate hike next week. Is it fair to assume that a lot of these

customers who had to reprice and move out of that deposit bucket have already done so, so we are at a point
where your non-interest bearing balances should begin to stabilize or is that not the right way to think about it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
No, I think, Ebrahim, that's kind of where we're at. We kind of expect that those balances – I think the people that
had excess balances in those DDAs, have really put a lot of time and effort in getting those balances moved out
of there, being more efficient in their – managing their cash positions. But I do expect that we'll still see some of
that in the second quarter. And as I mentioned, I think this hopefully is a low point for us, the second quarter.
We're not projecting currently that we see a huge increase, but we are expecting stabilization and slight
movements up through the rest of the year.
I think when I look at the percentage here, we were down below 40%. We'd been above 41%. But I think we're –
at the end of the quarter, I think it was 39% or – 39%, something like that. I don't expect that it'll change a whole
lot at this point. We're feeling downward pressure through the second quarter and hopefully after that we begin to
see stabilization. To the extent we see increases in interest-bearing which we're going to be happy to see, we
could see some decline.
Obviously, the percentage that we had of non-interest bearing to interest-bearing was inflated the last few years.
That's starting with COVID as those commercial balances really increased significantly, starting with some of
those PPP balances in 2020. So, I think we're getting back to somewhat of a more normalized percentage
between non-interest bearing and interest-bearing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just as a separate question, I think, Phil, you mentioned based on surveys internally mixed signals and
tea leaves. How are you – like how do you think this shakes out in terms of whether or not we see a deeper
downturn over the next few months and quarters as opposed to our skirting a meaningful recession? Just give us
a sense of what you think will be the driving factors in terms of which way the economy plays out. And is that – is
any of that changing your outlook around investments, expansion into Dallas, any of those plans?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, Ebrahim, I wish I knew. I wish [indiscernible] (00:43:43) what the view would be. I mean, I really think things
are still good in the areas that we operate. And I realize we operate only in Texas, but it's a pretty good
environment. Certainly, commercial real estate is slowing. And it's really not because we're not getting people
coming in. I was talking not long ago at a meeting with the governor with the group, and actually I think also I
heard it later from the state [indiscernible] (00:44:10) there's a 1,000 people a day moving into the state. So, it's
not that we aren't having growth. It's been the arithmetic of the commercial real estate transactions just don't work
for the returns. And so that's really what's happened – that's the thing that slows. Everything else seems to be
pretty good. The biggest complaint I still hear is lack of availability of skilled labor. It is not so much all labor. It's
now kind of shifted to skilled labor. So, there's still a great job market looking to hire people. So, I don't think – it's
worth what you pay for, but I don't think we're going to see much of a recession, if one, in Texas in terms of where
we operate.
As far as what it means for us as far as expanding, it's not going to impact us at all. You saw those numbers. I
mean, it's not hurting our growth. And as far as – one thing I think is interesting. If you look at the expansion

numbers and we don't get every source of new customer right, I mean, we – but we do collect, like, where did you
come from, where were you banking before. And I saw at about a 20% sample size of new accounts, we're
getting two-thirds of our business is coming from these, what I call the too big to fail. I'm not going to name
names. You can guess who they are.
And so it tells me that – you hear a lot of narrative that, well, can regionals compete with them, et cetera. We can.
And we have been. And remember, March was our biggest month by far. So I think the dynamics are all good.
And I think that we just continue to look at other places that make sense for us to employ this strategy within the
states. So, no, it would not impact our expansion plans.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q

Phillip D. Green A

six more and say I'm within 25% of right either way on that. Jerry might have...

Jerry Salinas A

Yeah. Ebrahim, I think what we were saying was through April, we'd open six, three in Dallas and then two in –
three in Dallas in the first quarter and then two in April and one in Houston in the quarter. And I think we're
expecting to open another four locations in Dallas and two in Houston by the end of the year.

Manan Gosalia Q

Okay. A separate question. Just given your comments earlier on competitors pulling back, is that helping spreads
on new loans at all? And how do you expect those spreads to trend as we go through the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think it's helping some on spreads. I think it's helping on structure. I think it's adding about, let's say, in round
numbers, 5%. On average, more equity end of deals. And it's probably helping with guarantees and support, that
type of thing. I would say the really good projects, though, it's still competitive. And we tend to – we tend to not be
looking at institutional deals. They're, I call them smaller and it's still a fair amount of money, but less institutional.
And that means that there are a lot of banks trying to get that. And so, I would – I have seen less spread relief that
I've seen structure relief recently, but I think there's probably been a little bit of spread relief.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I think that if we just look at the new and renewed business, just linked-quarter is the best I've got. But on
the loans that are prime-based, yeah, we can see some nice improvement there and the same on [indiscernible]
(00:51:20). And I'm going to say the SOFR priced loans looked to be relatively flat, maybe down a little bit. So,
yeah, I think overall the spread looks better.

$8.6 billion. Okay. All right. That's very helpful. And then could you give us a sense around the cadence of

March? And then where did total borrowing stand at quarter-end?

Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Hey, can I come back? I'm sorry. I'm second-guessing myself what answer I gave you. So, we're at about right

deposits with us that are fully collateralized. That's what we were talking about. And it's really at the customer's

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Sure. At the end of the quarter – let me see here, we were at $4.2 billion. We started the quarter – at the end of

about a 32%, pretty consistent with where we've been. That's kind of the expectation.

The last question I had was just around the securities purchases. And I'm sorry if I missed it. But did you happen
to give what the new yields are that you're putting on, and then did you restate what the expected maturities are
going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, our duration went from 5.8 years for the total portfolio, is the only thing we gave, down to 5.5 years. And we
bought about $900 million in municipals. Hold on a second. I'm sorry. So, we bought $1.7 billion in agency at a
5.02% million and $390 million in municipals at a 5.01%. So, basically, putting stuff on – and the 50.1% is
[indiscernible] (00:55:32). So putting stuff on basically at 5%.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2023
This is Phil. So, I wanted to respond to a question about the office terms. It just took me a while to find it. As I
said, the investor office that is a term of within 12 months, 27%. 12 to 36 months is 19%. 36 months to 59 months
is 21%. And greater than 60 months is 33%. So, sorry I wasn't able to pull that up earlier.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Hey, Jon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Hey, Jon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Jerry, on the provision this quarter, would you – was that growth-driven or was that just driven by the charge-off?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
The charge-offs really where we saw most of that tied to.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. So, the – what is the message on the provision? How do you want us to think about that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I think that, really, as it turned out, I would expect that that's not going to be too far off our current
expectations based on the sort of loan guidance that you heard from Phil and based on some relative – based on
really good credit quality, but also making sure considerations about what we're seeing in the economy and the
possibility of a recession, even if it's mild. I would assume that that's not too bad of a run rate going forward for
the next couple of quarters.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, good. That helps. Just a couple other clarifications. You guys talked a little bit about the – I think it was the
dollar volume of new opportunities in the pipeline was up something like 20% year-to-date, but the probability
weight was flat. What drives that difference? What drives that lower probabilities, just saying that these
opportunities won't meet your standards or why that gap?

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 27-Apr-2023
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
No, it's mainly – an opportunity is just you're aware of a deal. You're sort of engaged on it. But customers may not
decide to go forward. It could be that you don't think that the current structure meet your standard. It could be a lot
of things. That might be competitively that they're just locked in to another institution and so our officer just feels
like his odds are maybe not as good as what they should be. It's definitely art and not science.
And I – it's really it. It's – whenever you have – again, we're talking about it this morning. When you have a pretty
good increase in opportunities like I mentioned and you miss now, when there are a lot of them that go in, the
lenders tend to not have as high a probability because you just got of deals you're sorting out. But it doesn't sound
very scientific, but it makes an impact. I tend to look at what the weighted pipeline is and I think it tells a little bit of
a story on how our people see things.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. All right. And then just last one as well – or last one here. Your talked about the record new consumer
account activity and you flagged Houston and Dallas. Any idea what percentage of these would be like a, what
you would call primary household relationship with primary banking relationship? Do you track that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I don't think we do on the consumer side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
What does your gut tell you on that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I would tell you that we are mostly primary. There are numbers which we – on the commercial side which
compare the top – it compares market share. Okay. I've seen it by market share segment. And so let's look at
customers with sales under $100 million, okay, in the markets we serve. And if you look at which of the banks –
say the top six, seven banks, which are the banks has the highest percentage of primary relationship. Okay. It's
us. All right. And that's just because of our relationship model. I mean, if we're going to bank you, we're going to
want to have, what we call, your funnel account, your core account, and so – and we don't even count it as a
relationship unless we get that account. So, my gut [indiscernible] (01:00:55) be pretty, maybe...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, I think that – I was here trying to get some information and talking to our head of retail. I think that he thinks
that it's about 70% of it is really that we're picking as primary household.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, that's great.
