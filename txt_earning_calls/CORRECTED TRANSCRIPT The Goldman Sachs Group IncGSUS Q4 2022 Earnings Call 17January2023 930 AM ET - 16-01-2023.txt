Q4 2022 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2023
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning. My name is Katie and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to
welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being
recorded today, January 17, 2023. Thank you.
Ms. Halio, you may begin your conference.

Chief Strategy Officer & Global Head-Investor Relations, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Good morning. This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations and Chief Strategy Officer at Goldman Sachs.
Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call.
Today, we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our
website at www.gs.com. Note information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures appear in the
earnings release and earnings presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group,

I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and our Chief Financial Officer, Denis
Coleman.
Let me pass the call to David.

David Michael Solomon
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Thanks, Carey, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin with a review of our
financial performance. Simply said, our quarter was disappointing and our business mix proved particularly
challenging. These results are not what we aspire to deliver to shareholders. We generated revenues of $10.6
billion and net earnings of $1.3 billion and earnings per share of $3.32. After nine straight quarters of double-digit
returns, fourth quarter performance was certainly an outlier. Results were impacted by several near-term
challenges given the difficult operating environment.
On the revenue front, underwriting volumes remained extremely muted despite green shoots that appeared at the
end of the third quarter. Thinking equity activities, activity levels dropped after a busy and volatile year for many of
our clients. And our equity investments portfolio saw continued headwinds.
We also saw higher loan loss provision and expenses. While compensation expenses were down 15% for the
year, quarterly expenses rose modestly versus the third quarter. We always strive to maintain a pay for
performance culture. With revenues down, compensation was lower. That said, we also recognize that we
operate in a talent-driven business and we must continue to invest in our people whose dedication is critical to our
world-class franchise.
On our earnings call last July, we first spoke about the challenging operating environment and the proactive
measures we were taking on expenses, including slowing hiring velocity and reducing certain components of our
non-compensation costs.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2023
We have and continue to be incredibly focused on managing our financial resources, especially in light of the
worse than expected backdrop in the fourth quarter. Specifically, we reduced the size of our balance sheet,
further optimized and reduced our RWA footprint and managed down our GSIB score to hit our 3% target. We
have also started firm-wide expense reduction efforts to offset inflationary pressures and right size the firm for the
current environment.
We made the difficult decision to conduct a 6% head count reduction exercise earlier this month. As we said, we
had paused our regular performance management-related reductions during the pandemic and also had a period
of strong growth in head count given the opportunity set in 2021. We feel deeply for the individuals that were
impacted by these reductions. They are extremely dedicated and talented individuals, and we wish them the best.
Additionally, we're taking a number of strategic actions to help us reach our financial targets and create
shareholder value. For instance, this quarter, we completed our reorganization, which will further strengthen our
core businesses, help us scale our growth platforms and improve efficiency. This is an important and purposeful
evolution of our strategic journey.
We also narrowed our ambitions in our consumer strategy and made some key decisions. We started a process
to cease offering new loans on the Marcus platform. We will likely allow the book to roll down naturally although
we're considering other alternatives. In addition, we have postponed the launch of our checking product. At the
right time in the future, we intend to offer checking to our Wealth Management clients. For now, our priority is to
strengthen our deposit franchise, card partnerships and GreenSky. Our narrowed approach will allow us to reduce
our forward investment spend and rationalize expenses.
We're very focused on developing a path toward profitability in Platform Solutions and we'll provide more detail at
our Investor Day next month. As you can see from our new segment reporting, we are committed to providing
continued transparency for you to hold us accountable.
I want to spend a moment on the broader operating environment. The backdrop over the last year has been
incredibly dynamic. There were headwinds we expected like high inflation, but some we never thought we'd see
like the ongoing land war in Ukraine. There aren't many signs of widespread distress. Balance sheets and
company fundamentals are relatively healthy but it's clear that the outlook for 2023 remains uncertain.
In the US, Central Bank rate increases have started to have an impact on inflation but they're also lowering the
growth trajectory of the economy. And the labor market remains remarkably tight with an estimated 1.7 job
openings available for every unemployed American.
Our clients are thinking a lot about how to navigate this complex backdrop. CEOs and boards tell me they're
cautious particularly for the near term. They're rethinking business opportunities and would like to see more
stability before committing to longer-term plans. Many firms have started preparing for tougher times focusing on
factors within their control.
Taking a step back, I am proud of the significant progress we have made in our strategic evolution since Investor
Day 2020. Despite a more challenged fourth quarter performance, we delivered for shareholders in 2022. We
generated double-digit returns in a year, where rapid monetary tightening and ongoing macro uncertainty drove
significant market disruption with both equity and fixed income markets falling for the first time in over 50 years.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2023
We grew management and other fees by 13% year-over-year and grew net interest income by 19%. We reduced
our on-balance sheet alternative investments by $9 billion. We also returned $6.7 billion of capital in the form of
dividends and share repurchases, and we grew our book value by 7%. This brings our book value growth since
our first Investor Day to almost 40%, roughly twice as much as our next closest competitor.
That said, we remain focused on the work ahead of us and we believe we have a lot to play for. As we go forward,
we are executing on three key priorities we've laid out for the businesses: number one, growing management fees
on our Asset & Wealth Management business; number two, maximizing wallet share and growing financing
activities at our Global Banking & Markets business; number three, scaling Platform Solutions to deliver
profitability.
We have a proven track record of navigating a wide range of operating environments and we will continue to
execute our long-term client-oriented strategy regardless of where we are in the cycle. We have the people in
place around the world to serve our clients' broad range of needs with excellence. And we are operating from a
position of strength with robust capital levels and a clear focus on the path forward. I remain optimistic about the
future of Goldman Sachs and confident that we will continue to deliver for shareholders. We look forward to
speaking more about this with all of you at our Investor Day on February 28.
I'll now turn it over to Denis.

Denis P. Coleman
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start on page 2 of the presentation. In 2022, we generated net revenues
of $47.4 billion, net earnings of $11.3 billion and earnings per share of $30.06. As David highlighted, we have
implemented our organizational changes, which form the basis for our earnings presentation today.
Turning to performance by business starting on page 3, Global Banking & Markets generated revenues of $32.5
billion for the year, down 12%, as higher FICC revenues were more than offset by a steep decline in investment
banking fees versus record results last year. The exceptional performance of our Global Banking & Markets
business over the last three years, including the market share gains we have generated, has served a strong
ballast for firm-wide performance.
In the fourth quarter, investment banking fees fell 48% year-over-year, driven by a significant decline in both
equity and debt underwriting as issuance volumes remain muted amid continued market uncertainty. Advisory
revenues, however, were $1.4 billion, the third highest in our history, rising 45% quarter-over-quarter on higher
completed deal volumes.
For 2022, we maintained our number one league table position completed M&A, as we have for 23 of the last 24
years. And we ranked second in equity and equity-related underwriting. We also ranked second in high yield debt
underwriting, up from number three last year.
Our backlog fell quarter-on-quarter on lower levels of activity but remain solid particularly in Advisory. That being
said, clients are focused on stability and financial conditions, pushing out the timing of transactional activity. While
we expect investors will need more certainty before financing markets reopen more broadly, we are seeing some
positive signs of activity, particularly in investment grade markets, which have had a strong start to the year in
both the United States and Europe.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2023
FICC net revenues were $2.7 billion in the quarter, up 44% year on year. In intermediation, we saw strength in
rates and commodities amid elevated levels of client engagement, catalyzed by increased Central Bank activity
and rate volatility and improved market-making conditions. If FICC financing, we saw increases in secured
lending, driven by higher balances. Full year FICC revenues of $14.7 billion rose 38%.
Equities net revenues were $2.1 billion in the quarter, down 5% year-on-year. The year-over-year decline in
intermediation revenues was driven by lower levels of client activity, particularly in derivatives, after strong
engagement levels throughout the year. Financing revenues of $964 million were relatively resilient despite a
decline in prime balances as clients took risk off throughout the quarter. Across FICC and Equities, financing
revenues were up 20% in 2022, consistent with our strategic priority to grow client-financing activities.
Moving to Asset & Wealth Management on page 5, for 2022, revenues of $13.4 billion were down 39% year-over-
year as a steep decline in revenues from equity and debt investments offset an additional $1 billion of
management and other fees and a strong increase in private banking and lending revenues. Fourth quarter
management and other fees of $2.2 billion were up 10% year-over-year. Full year management and other fees
were $8.8 billion, putting us well on track to hit our $10 billion target in 2024.
Fourth quarter private banking and lending net revenues reached a record $753 million, up 77% year-over-year
due to higher deposit spreads and higher lending and deposit balances. Equity investments produced net
revenues of $287 million, driven by $270 million of gains on our $13 billion private equity portfolio and roughly
$500 million in operating revenues and gains related to CIEs, partially offset by $485 million of net losses related
to investments in our $2 billion public portfolio. Debt investments revenues were $234 million, including net
interest income up $360 million.
Moving on to page 6, total firm-wide assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $2.5 trillion, driven by
market appreciation as well as strong net inflows across fixed income and liquidity products.
Let's now turn to page 7, where I will review a new page in our presentation focused on our alternatives franchise.
Alternative AUS totaled $263 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, driving $492 million in management and other
fees for the quarter and $1.8 billion for the year. We remain on track to reach our $2 billion target in 2024. Gross
third-party fundraising was $15 billion for the quarter and totaled $72 billion for the year. Third-party fundraising
since Investor Day stands at $179 billion.
The table on the bottom left shows our on-balance sheet alternative investment portfolio, which totaled $59 billion.
Despite the challenging environment, we reduced on-balance sheet investments by $9 billion in 2022, of which $2
billion was in the fourth quarter. We remain committed to our strategy to reduce balance sheet density and
migrate our alternatives business to more third-party funds.
I'll turn to Platform Solutions on page 8. Full year revenues were $1.5 billion, more than double versus 2021. Full
year losses of $1.7 billion were driven by $1.7 billion of provisions as we built reserves to reflect $8 billion of loan
growth across the portfolio. We also incurred $1.8 billion in expenses as we continue to build out and run these
businesses. This included over $200 million of transaction and integration-related cost driven by GreenSky and
GM Card portfolio acquisitions. We expect these costs to also impact 2023 results, though at a lower level, and
decline materially over subsequent years. As David said, our number one priority for this segment is to reach
profitability. And we look forward to providing you with further details at our Investor Day next month.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2023
On page 9, firm-wide net interest income of $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter was up 2% relative to the third quarter
due to higher rates and increased loan balances. Our total loan portfolio at quarter-end was $179 billion, modestly
higher versus the third quarter, reflecting growth in collateralized lending and credit cards.
Our provision for credit losses was $972 million. For our wholesale portfolio, provisions were driven by
impairments and portfolio growth. The overall credit quality of our wholesale lending portfolio remains resilient.
In relation to our retail portfolio, provisions were driven by continued portfolio growth, net charge-offs and a
worsening of our baseline scenario. We're seeing early signs of our credit deterioration that are in line with our
expectations. We anticipate further pressure in 2023 given the vintage and nature of our portfolio.
Let's turn to expenses on page 10. Quarterly operating expenses were $8.1 billion. Total operating expenses for
the year were $31.2 billion, down 2%. Compensation expenses fell 15% despite a 10% increase in head count
and were partially offset by higher non-compensation expenses. The increase was primarily related to
acquisitions, transaction-based costs and continued investments in technology. In addition, client-driven market
development costs were higher, following lower levels during the pandemic.
As previously discussed, we're actively engaged in expense mitigation efforts. This includes targeted reductions
across communications and technology spend, professional fees, and advertising costs as well as the recent
head count reduction exercise. We expect that the impact of these actions will become more fully reflected in our
results over time. We remain highly focused on operating efficiency and are committed to our 60% efficiency ratio
target as the right place to run the firm.
Turning to capital on slide 11, our common equity tier 1 ratio was 15.1% at the end of the fourth quarter under the
standardized approach, up 80 basis points sequentially. This represents a 130-basis-point buffer to our new
capital requirement of 13.8%. In the fourth quarter, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders, including common
stock repurchases of $1.5 billion and common stock dividends of $880 million. Based on our capital levels at the
end of the quarter, we started 2023 with a strong capital position, enabling us to support our clients and return
excess capital to shareholders.
As it relates to our funding plan, based on current expectations, we intend for 2023 issuance to run significantly
below 2022 levels, though we will remain dynamic with respect to business needs and market opportunities.
In conclusion, despite the challenging operating environment in 2022, we delivered double-digit returns for
shareholders, returned $6.7 billion of capital and made material progress on our strategic initiatives to better serve
clients and strengthen and diversify the firm. We remain focused on executing on our strategic priorities and
creating value for our shoulders and we look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Investor Day in
February.
With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now take a moment to compile the Q&A roster. [Operator
Instructions] Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. We'll take our first question from
Glenn Schorr with Evercore.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thanks very much. So, given the capital, RWA and expense actions that you've already taken, if 2023 is a little
bit better in banking but it's kind of the same atmosphere we've been in because it feels like it's lingering, can you
all get closer to your return targets this year? I know it's very difficult in this backdrop, but what I'm getting at is do
we need investment banking to be a lot better to get there or have the actions you've taken start closing the gap?
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So, thanks, Glenn. And I appreciate the question. Obviously, an improved capital markets environment would
certainly help in that direction. We talk about our targets in a normalized environment. One thing I just want to
make sure people are focused on is we have to do better in Asset Management. This certainly has been a part of
our strategy over the last three years is to reduce our balance sheet in Asset Management, and we've made real
progress on that over the last three years. But we still have a very significant Asset Management balance sheet,
larger than we'd like to have. We reduced it by $9 billion this past year and we intend to move forward.
But given the disruption in asset prices and the density of that balance sheet, it's not surprising when you have
$32 billion of capital allocated to that segment. And if you look at the fourth quarter, the fourth quarter, it earned
zero even with some businesses in there that are highly profitable. I don't think that's normal. I don't think our
expectation is that continues exactly the same way. And so, I think a combination of some normalization in capital
markets activities and a more balanced environment with respect to the Asset Management balance sheet
certainly would have a big impact.
I'd highlight, last year, we way outperformed the peer average ROE by about 900 basis points because of kind of
the massive outperformance of that balance sheet given all the stimulus and a bunch of that reversed and we're
just more sensitive to that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
I mean, things I might add, Glenn, is in addition to our business mix on the forward, I think the reason why we're
taking action with respect to our head count footprint and some of our non-compensation expenses is to drive
efficiency even further, and as you point out ,with the capital build that we have as at the beginning of the year,
we're in a pretty flexible position in terms of how we can deploy that either in support of attractive opportunities
within the business and/or returning incremental capital to shareholders.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2023
Okay. I appreciate that. And then maybe [ph] staying of the 50,000 (00:20:52), Transaction banking is good but
it's unfortunately a small revenue base. Consumer may be music to some investors' ears or is being de-
emphasized. So, I guess my question is, where's – your goal is to build a more durable firm, and I share that goal,
where do you think that comes from going forward if some of the pieces are either small or being de-emphasized
from the past strategy? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Well, I think, Glenn, that the big thing in that, and it's always been a big part of it, is the shift from a balance sheet-
intensive Asset Management business to a client-oriented fee-based business. Our organic growth across our
Asset Management business on a relative basis was still good in 2022 when you look broadly across the industry.
We continue to grow our management fees in the Asset Management business. We're continuing to grow our
Wealth business. Our Wealth business overall grew nicely during the course of 2022. And so, it's that mix change,
less balance sheet intensive, growth in Asset & Wealth Management, continued financing growth in our core
Global Banking & Markets business, which you've seen and continue to grow, and then getting these platforms
that we have to operate profitably, which we believe we can do.
We believe they're good businesses at scale but they're in a different stage of their development. Those things
should make the business more resilient. And that's not inconsistent with the strategy we laid out three years ago
and we will amplify again next month at Investor Day. What I think was an outlier for sure in this environment is
the massive quick swing in asset prices and the impact that our capital markets-heavy and balance sheet-intense
business had, of course, was a drag from some of the investments we're making in other things.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning, and thank you. I guess maybe, David, just sticking to that, as you make the Asset Management
business less dense in terms of balance sheet consumption, how do we think about the ROTE target you put out
last year? Is that still achievable within the three-year time period that you had laid out, or does that get pushed
out given the work that needs to be done and in a way that Consumer is being de-emphasized?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
I think, candidly, that it depends on the environment. An environment with massive swing in asset prices
continues, we'll push it out. If that simply normalizes, then the overall economic picture of the firm, in addition to
the work we're doing on the expense side that we've gotten focused on, will show a very, very different picture. I'm
not going to guess on how that will play out, but again, I'd amplify that I don't think what we saw in 2022 was
normal. And certainly if you go back and look at 15 years of history, it wasn't.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Noted. And I guess just as a follow-up in terms of growth in Asset Management, Wealth Management, significant
asset price dislocations, does that create some M&A opportunities when you think about inorganic growth in those
businesses or, for the time being, is the expectation that most of this is going to be organic?

David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
I think, at the moment, we're extremely focused on, in 2023, executing on the decisions we made to invest in our
platform. And moving forward from here, I do think that in the future, there still could be inorganic opportunities to
accelerate the journey in Asset & Wealth Management. But certainly this year, we're focused on the execution.
We made an acquisition in Asset Management last year. We want to integrate NNIP. We want to move forward
with that. So, I think this year we'll be focused on execution.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
So, David and Denis, wanted to start off with a question just on the provision outlook. Admittedly, the loan loss
provision came in higher than we had anticipated. I was hoping you could just speak to how much of it was growth
math related versus deterioration in the macro. And given some of the planned actions you're going to take for
that business, how should we think about like normalized level of loan growth and provision expectation that we
should expect going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Good morning. Thank you. Thank you for that. So, let me help with some color as it relates to provisions,
particularly in the fourth quarter. So, order of magnitude, the component of that build attributable to growth was
about 50%. Net charge-offs about 25% and the balance attributable to our scenario.
I think what you can see in the build of the provisions over the course of the fourth quarter, and we do expect
some of this to continue over the course of 2023, is that we began the on-balance sheet originations and our
point-of-sale lending platform, GreenSky, and so, that obviously brings with it an upfront reserve build. So, that's
something that initiated over the balance of this past year and will continue through the following year.

have a proposal yet, but certainly it has significant implications for future returns you can generate. You're running

various businesses. What planned actions can you take to maybe mitigate some of the pain?

Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. Fair questions on everybody's mind. As you note, we don't yet have the details. But we give it a lot of
thought. We've taken a number of steps in terms of building out our modeling capabilities to make sure as and
when we do get an actual rule that we'll be in a position to respond quickly to that. We do have a long-standing
track record of responding to changes to regulatory guidance. You can see over the course of the fourth quarter,
across a number of our financial resources, that we were able to maneuver them very, very quickly to build capital
and change our RWA footprint given our view of the environment and some strategic decisions there. So, we're
standing by for more detail on the rule, but confident that when we get it, we'll be able to manage accordingly.

Two questions. One follow-up on the Consumer business. I heard you on the Markets pullback, you're going to
cease originating there. Does that give you more room to lean into growth and we should expect acceleration in
the partner card, GreenSky, those pieces that you're keeping? Or is this Markets pullback going to feed either
capital increase or the ability to lean in other business lines like the ISG business.

Sure. Betsy, it's Denis. I'll start with that. So, as we indicated, we're going to cease the originations under markets
lending and then, furthermore, expect for that portfolio actually to roll off or we may pursue other alternatives. That
should free up a bunch of financial resources. We're continued within the overall Asset & Wealth Management
segment, where the deposit business is resonant within the private banking and lending line. That remains a

strategic priority for the firm, and we've experienced very good growth there. That business is achieving more and
more scale. So, that will remain an ongoing focus.
I think once we have reduced some of the resourcing allocated to markets and lending, we'll continue to narrow
the focus of our ambitions and our investment spend. And within the Platform Solutions business, we're now down
to three different businesses, Transaction banking, the cards platform, and our point-of-sale lending business,
GreenSky. And our focus is really on just narrowing to drive those businesses across the segment to profitability.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Then separate question just on the expenses in this quarter. I know you had the action of a head count
reduction. Is there a severance embedded in this quarter that we should strip out? Because obviously it's not
ongoing, or does that hit 1Q? Maybe you could speak to how we should think about that. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. Thanks, Betsy. Because we communicated the reductions in 2023, any associated severance expense
associated with those reductions will be 2023 expenses.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2023
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
We're happy to take questions both positive and tough. I mean, it wasn't a great quarter, so I don't expect all the
questions to be easy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Well, I mean, it is concerning in terms of the reorg. I mean, we'll get more at the Investor Day. And just a
comment, I hope you give us more data. Here we have three new sectors and you only give us the prior four
quarters and the prior two years without much detail. So, I hope you give us more ahead. But the question is, you
present the firm differently, but will the firm actually be run differently other than the more narrow focus on
Consumer?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. And so, I appreciate that and two comments. First just on the transparency and information comment, I
think this management team, Mike, over the last four-and-a-half years, has been super focused on increasing the
transparency of Goldman Sachs and we remain focused on that. If you have certain feedback on things you'd like
to see, et cetera, we really welcome that and Carey will reach out to you and we'll take that feedback. But we're
focused on giving our investors more and more and creating the right kind of transparency around what we're
doing.
Second, on the evolution and the move to this, what I'd say and this has been something that's been a journey
that we started a number of years ago, but the firm is now organized and presented externally the same way we
run it internally. And that candidly is a difference than the way Goldman Sachs has been during my tenure at the
firm.
In terms of our core business of Banking & Markets, there are synergies that we've been driving as these
businesses cooperate that we think we can now get more out of in our client orientation across our broad
franchise that this organization of those businesses together really helps. I highlight that we feel great about the
performance of those businesses since our Investor Day. It's long forgotten but when we did our Investor Day
back in 2020, nobody believed that we could get the ROE of the Markets business above 10%. That was a big
question on the minds of investors. And we look now at our combined Banking & Markets business, this business
we think is a leader. It outperforms in terms of its market share, it outperforms in terms of its returns relative to
competitors, and we continue to grow it and continue to stay laser focused on the client experience and also the
returns and the performance of that business. We also think there continues to be opportunity to grow our
financing business there and we're very, very focused on that.
In Asset & Wealth Management, we've worked hard to bring a number of businesses together into an integrated
franchise so we can really have transparency and focus on our ability to grow management fees and drive
performance and serve more clients in that business, and as we've said over the last few years, reduce the
balance sheet intensity of that. And we're on a journey.
Would I like it to be further along? Yes. If it was further along, there would have been less volatility, particularly in
the context of this year and the fourth quarter. But we continue – that's something we laid out three years ago and
we continue to move at that. The change strategically of a narrowing of our focus on certain things in Consumer

business I think is a change. We continue to feel very good about the deposit platform and the contribution it
makes.
We think our partnership with Apple will provide meaningful dividends for the firm over time. We think GreenSky is
a good business that can be accretive. But the platforms are in a different stage of development than our other
businesses. They're small in the overall scale of Goldman Sachs but we think there are benefits to that for the
firm. We'll communicate more as we move forward around that. But we're making progress, and we'll continue to
run that narrow focus in a way that we think can drive profitability. So, that's a high-level response. I don't know if
there's something else you want me to drill into but that's a high-level response.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yeah, the follow-up is more specific. I mean, look, you said it's a disappointing quarter. Your returns are well
below where you want them to be. And variable revenues and variable costs not so much. Your efficiency ratio
has gone the other direction. So, I mean, I think investors would appreciate some detail on some of the benefits of
what you might get on the expense side. Okay? You're scaling back Consumer as I asked you last quarter, you
said you were losing money. Maybe you lose less money. The head count reduction should allow you to save
money. So, can you ballpark the benefits to expenses from the moves in Consumer and the head count
reduction? And along those lines, now that you've moved capital well above the regulatory and your own firm's
target, buybacks, so cost and buyback kind of what to think about for 2023?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure, Mike. Let me take that. So, unpacking a couple components. So, we exercised head count reduction earlier
this year. Approximately 3,200 employees left the firm. The run rate expense associated with that group was
approximately $475 million, and we expect to benefit in 2023 north of $200 million associated with that. Beyond
that, we have a series of non-compensation expense initiatives. We're setting out guardrails for our business
leaders to drive more efficient levels of non-compensation spend. The narrowing of the focus in Consumer is
important. There are a number of ways in which we could have chosen to expand the offering and capabilities of
that but the focus is now narrow. And then finally, as you identify, we have more flexibility with respect to capital
deployment, which we intend to take advantage of.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to follow up on some of those questions from Mike.
And just really, to be honest, kind of surprised to not hear that there were restructuring and severance charges in
the fourth quarter just given how elevated the expenses were. So, I guess, can you provide a little bit of color on
the inflexibility? Revenues down 20% for the full year, and I understand that of course markets are competitive,
but the positioning of comp in 2021 was to – it was a remarkable year, some of it even identified or segregated as
special and therefore shouldn't be expected to repeat. So, was the discipline fully there? Are you doing enough on
comp? You have reiterated the focus on efficiency, but the results here in – I get it, nobody is buying Goldman
today for 2022 results, but still the results seem to set up sort of a challenging entry point for the beginning of the
year.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2023
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So, Brennan, a couple of questions. As for the reasons to take severance expense in 2023, that's the accounting
rules with respect to the timing of our communication to those employees. So, that's what explains the timeframe
in which the expense is going to be booked.
As it relates to compensation expense, variable expense flexibility in the fourth quarter, I guess I would point out a
couple of things. One, overall comp and benefit expense were down 15%. We had grown head count by 10%
additionally. And when you – that's over $2.5 billion of less compensation and benefit expense. So, it's a
meaningful number.
And if you look at the components of our employee base, we have a very large number of people that own
relatively less money, are impacted by inflation, and are really important to the overall operation and delivery of
our firm on behalf of our clients. And we have relatively fewer employees that are higher-earning employees, face
clients and generate revenue and we're able to reduce the compensation substantially there in line with the
performance.
But ultimately it's a balance. And we have excellent people, we depend on them to deliver for clients, the market
for talent remains really robust. And we had to strike the right balance between taking down that variable expense
in respect of our performance while maintaining the franchise to make sure we're in the position that we can
deliver for clients and shareholders in 2023 and beyond. Certainly, we're going to have brighter opportunity sets
on the forward and we want to make sure that we're positioned to capture that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. All right. Thanks. Thanks for that color, Denis. I appreciate that. This one might end up being moot, but I
just kind of want to confirm that I was spending some time yesterday looking at previous disclosures of J curve
expectation and whatnot. But it seems as though exiting Marcus and the tone down, should we not even be
thinking about a J curve for the Consumer business? Is that not a consideration here any longer? Because it does
seem as though the cross through from the breakeven, even ex-provision has been a lot longer than expected.
So, should we just forget about that chart given the pivot? Or does that still remain part of the consideration?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So, a couple things I would point out. As people would have seen in the earnings release this morning, the
Platform Solutions segment on a quarter-over-quarter basis actually had reduced operating expenses. So, we
remain really focused on continuing to drive at the expense of these platforms in aggregate and we expect to
drive a lot of benefit at scale. But as we've discussed and you'll observe, we also continue to build provisions as
we scale some of those activities. And so, our focus remains singularly on driving towards profitability of the
segment. But there will continue to be a period of time during which we lose money until we reach that point of
ultimate profitability. And we do look forward to trying to help people to understand and map out that progression
across the various businesses within that segment at Investor Day.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
I guess just first want to zero in on Transaction banking here in platforms. $325 million for Transaction banking
and other in 2022 was up 50% year-over-year. So, you guys have really had great growth from scratch just a
couple years ago but still obviously immaterial. So, just want to talk a little bit about how you feel like progress is
going in that part of the business. Can this get to a multibillion-dollar business just doing kind of what it's already
doing? I know you just launched in Europe there. I'm really just trying to think about kind of the execution roadmap
for that part of the business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. Thanks for that question. We're very pleased with the progress of the Transaction banking business. And
it's a business that has particular benefits as we scale activities on it. We have our [ph] TAC (00:42:30) platform
up and running. We continue to grow our clients on the platform. They unanimously continue to give us the
feedback that it is a very differentiated and attractive platform to be part of. And we have taken that business, as
you say, from its inception to larger scale.
We think there's a lot of potential for that business on the forward. And we're very focused at this point in time in
continuing to drive deposit balances, continuing to drive our customer count, further penetrate, as you mention,
our international expansion continues. We've opened in our fifth country. We now have increasing capabilities to
serve clients across the world. There are true benefits to the network effect of a business like this with global
reach. And we continue to see very, very good opportunities for this business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Okay. Great. Thanks. A follow-up here just on the Markets financing opportunity. So, that's already obviously
been a nice part of the story for Goldman. What do you need to do to grow financing further? Is it just a lot of the
same kind of blocking and tackling, are there specific things you can point to that could drive kind of another step
function there? And then just kind of more near term, you talked about prime brokerage balances being down and
declining through the quarter. Has that changed at all just to start this year with risk appetites maybe a bit better
today than through most of fourth quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. A couple comments I would make. So, I think as it relates to FICC financing, we have a very good
opportunity set in front of us. The progress that we've made with the client franchise and our market shares and
given the overall backdrop and the availability of financing in the world right now, our clients continue to come to
16

us. And given the capital position that we sit with at the beginning of the year, we have capacity to fuel
incremental financing activities in the FICC business.
On the Equity side of the equation, obviously asset markets moved around quite severely, particularly in the end
of the year, which drives prime brokerage balances. But as you know, we're also working very hard to reduce our
financial resource footprint, particularly our GSIB level. That brought with it significant RWA reductions and it was
not really the environment that we were pushing on growth certainly in the fourth quarter. I think as we turn the
page on a new year, there is lots of opportunity for us to continue to drive our equity financing activities, and we
have less constraints given that we've now achieved the 3% GSIB target.

Operator: We'll take our next question from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel T. Fannon Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to expand upon the new slide 7 and ask, as you look at the different buckets in
asset classes, how much of these funds are evergreen and open or are going through periodic fundraises and
closings? And I was hoping you can maybe provide some context on what the fundraising has been for
subsequent funds, meaning the size increase that you've typically seen for second or third funds from the
previous ones to give us a sense of the momentum you're seeing in that business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So, we always have a very, very broad portfolio of funds. And we've been in this investing business for a
number of decades. It's one of the contributors to our position as the number five largest active asset
management firm in the world. And across the portfolio of different funds, we have some extremely mature
businesses. Our GS Capital Partners equity investing business, our mezzanine funds, some of our loan funds.
We have multiple mature businesses that are frequently deploying successfully and then going back to raise new
monies and continue to support sort of the franchises that we have in that channel. And we continue to diversify
and expand our offering and open up new strategies in response to what we see are pockets for client demand.
So, as we think about the overall opportunity set, we have a global broad and deep investing platform that has
offerings for many different types of investors, many of which are very, very mature in terms of their track record
and some of which are newer.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel T. Fannon Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And then just following up on the earlier question around kind of the FICC and trading backdrop, it sounds
like you're through kind of the optimization of RWAs but maybe can you talk about where you see, on the broader
intermediation side, the backdrop – maybe the backdrop today and maybe where you see market share
opportunities into the rest of the year?

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 17-Jan-2023
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So, we continue to focus on market share. Market share data lags but through the third quarter of last year,
it shows that we continued to grow market share in [ph] part of (00:47:37) those businesses, sales and trading.
So, that remains a very, very core focus of the firm. We continue to make progress and we think we can make
incremental progress.
One of the attractive things about that business for us is that we have a number of different business lines, which
have enabled us to perform across a variety of environments. The last year, given what happened with rate
normalization and energy markets around the world were a particular tailwind to the interest rate products
business, the commodities business. Meanwhile, we had softer performance in credit, mortgages and some of the
equity intermediation activities.
Certainly if the new issue debt underwriting markets come back online, as early indications from the investment
grade side of things suggest, and if the equity underwriting activities are to open up, there's a lot of activity that
takes place with investors as they position in advance of and after new offerings that we should be able to capture
given the investment that we've made in the client franchise. So, I can't predict exactly where activity will come
from 2023. Certainly, some of it may be a continuation of those areas that were active in 2022, but it's quite
possible that certain activities that were softer in 2022 could rotate and become more relevant in 2023.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. You mentioned continued interest in Asset & Wealth Management deals kind of over time it
sounds more like bolt-on. But I guess just are you more open-minded towards maybe a transformational deal as
we think out not necessarily this year but just the next couple of years? I mean, to-date, you've what I would
characterize – I think most people would characterize you've [ph] piecemealed (00:49:23) some deals, you've
done some organic expansion, and mixed results in different areas, but just thoughts on maybe more openness of
something transformational down the road.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
I think we've been asked this question. I appreciate the question. We've been asked it a bunch over time. I think in
certain businesses like Asset & Wealth Management, there are significant things that could meaningfully
accelerate the platform. And we have the fifth largest active asset manager in the world now that we've stood up
all the businesses inside Goldman Sachs. And so, that scale is real and there certainly could be opportunities to
increase that scale and certainly there are opportunities in Wealth for us to do things that are more significant. I
would say that the bar to do those things is extraordinarily high. There are not a lot of opportunities out there
necessarily to do it.
Certainly, over the last five years the prices have been eye popping. Maybe we're in a different environment
where that will normalize, but we're always open to things that we think can strengthen Goldman Sachs but also
as somebody that's been a M&A banker for a significant part of my career, I know the bar to do that, the cultural
issues, the integration issues, the bar has to be very, very high. So, I'd say we're always open, but at the moment
our focus is on executing on the plate of opportunities we have in front of us. And we think we can drive good

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you. Good morning. David, in your opening comments, you gave us your three priorities of growing
management fees in the Asset & Wealth Management business, maximizing the wallet share, and growing
financing activities in Global Banking & Markets and then scaling the Platform. In the number two, maximizing the
wallet share, can you share with us where are you today with the wallet share both in Investment Banking and
Markets and how are you pursuing to grow that over the next couple of years?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. So, we – you can take a look at our performance of these businesses, and you can see that the
performance is quite strong. A couple of things I'll point to even in this quarter's performance, you can look at our
relative M&A revenue performance. You can look at our relative FICC performance and even our Equities
performance in what's been a tough quarter. The relatives look pretty good. We set out three years ago and this
was a big structural change. We had never really thought about client market shares in our Markets business. We
had always thought about them in our Investment Banking business, and we really – we brought that ethos into
the Markets business.
And I know everyone on this call has heard us talk about how three years ago we set out to say there are 100
clients that contribute meaningfully to our FICC and Equities businesses and we are top 3 with only 44 of them.
We are now top 3 with 77 of those top 100. And now we have shifted the focus to really look at, okay, top three
but why aren't we one and two, what are the number of clients that we can be number one and two with, and we
think there's more room that we can drive on wallet share by really focusing on FICC and Equities on that number
one and number two position.
In Banking, the wallet share has really come from footprint growth. That footprint growth candidly has been a little
bit expensive when there's been zero capital markets revenue because that footprint growth does tilt toward
capital markets activity. But we think that will serve us well if you take a three or a five-year view looking forward.
So, again, there's a lot of attention paid to some of the things that we're investing in. The core of the firm is very
strong. Those wallet shares are strong, but we still see more opportunity. And we're laser-focused on continuing
to execute on it. And I don't think there's any business in Investment Banking and Markets that is as strong and
powerful as this business, so we'll continue to focus on strengthening it as we move forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then as a follow-up on the shift in strategy on the Consumer business, you've been very clear
obviously on how you're positioning this going forward. I may have missed this, so I apologize, but what went
wrong? When you go back to when you guys started to move into these businesses three years ago or so, I know

Marcus deposits has been around longer than that, but when you look back on what you were hoping to do and
how it turned out, what went wrong?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Well, I think there are a bunch of things that went right and there were some things that did not go well. I think we
executed well on some things, and we didn't execute on others. But the simple thing that I would phrase, Gerard,
and I think it's a fair question is we tried to do too much too quickly. And, of course, in the environment that we're
in, it's hard to go back where we started on that strategy six years ago. We obviously built the deposit business,
the loan business, and we talked about a much broader platform. And I think we came to the conclusion that there
were some changes.
One of the big changes that affect the pace of the ability to do this and it's different in scaling things like this is
CECL was a big change. CECL changed the curve on growing these lending businesses at scale from scratch.
So, we've had to adjust to that. The regulatory environment has also changed over the course of the last couple of
years. But I think it became clear to us early in 2022 that we were doing too much, it was affecting our execution. I
think we probably in some places haven't had all the talent that we've needed to execute the way we've wanted.
We're making adjustments on that. But by narrowing down the three core things that we're going to focus on that
we actually think are good businesses that can be accretive to the firm, I think we've got it in a place now where
we can create a more cogent path forward, and so that's what we're doing.
And I – the takeaway I'd like investors to understand is when we see things, we look at things, and we pivot.
We're not married to things. We're willing to change. I think when I go back to our 2020 Investor Day and I look at
what we laid out during that period of time, we've accomplished and have executed on the vast majority of things
we've laid out. That doesn't mean there's not more work to do. But you know what? We didn't execute perfectly on
some. So, we've taken a hard look at those and you make adjustments.
And that's kind of the ethos of the nimbleness of Goldman Sachs that I want to amplify. We're always willing to
make changes. We're always going to focused on shareholders. And even though everything's not gone perfectly,
again, I'd point to our 40% book value growth since our Investor Day and I'd map that out. Our book value per
share growth, I believe, it's more than double the next nearest competitor. So, we're going to continue to stay
focused on the medium and long term. I think we're good at nimbly making adjustments and we'll always be very
clear [ph] that (00:56:38) when we get things right or we get things wrong.

Hey. Good morning. Maybe just your thoughts on the outlook for Investment Banking. Appreciate Denis'
comments. We've seen a big increase in debt issuance, saw some improving liquidity in the debt marks at least.
Is that in your mind a leading indicator for beginning to monetize backlogs and just generally how are you thinking
about the outlook for Investment Banking? Thanks.

Yeah. Sure. I think that one of the things we're dealing with and it's over-amplified in our very capital market-
centric business is that 2021 was not normal. The second half of 2020 and 2021 were not normal. They were way

inflated by the massive fiscal stimulus that created kind of I'd call on the spectrum of activity excess activity, pulled
a lot of activity forward. And then because of market disruption, we've tightened monetary conditions meaningfully
in 2022. It's the first year in over 50 years that both fixed income and equity markets were down. We had the S&P
down 20%, the NASDAQ down 30%. You had a real change in asset values across the spectrum. And when that
happens, it takes a period of time for people to adjust.
My historical experience would be that period of time is kind of four to six quarters. And so, if you think about it, if
somebody had a stock that was trading at $100 and the stock goes down by 30%, certainly for the next couple of
quarters, they're still thinking of $100. But if it's at $70 for four, five, six quarters, then it's $70 and suddenly when
you look ahead, and you think about either an M&A transaction or financing, you have more realism about the
reset in values. So, I think we're well into that journey of a reset in expectations. Think it might have another
quarter or two to further reset but I think we're starting to see some additional improvements. People point to the
investment grade debt market. That would obviously be where it would come first. But my expectations would be
in the back half of 2023 meaningfully better. And also, it's interesting, and I'll be heading to Davos tonight with
others, but I was watching some of the commentary, the macro commentary.
People are softening their view of 2023. And I'd say it's getting a little bit more dovish or a little bit more of a softer
landing than kind of where people were a quarter or two ago. And that too will affect capital marks opportunity
because it's really tied to confidence. So, I think we're going through that. I don't think anything is fundamentally
changed. I think these capital markets businesses are still very big businesses. But you shouldn't look at 2022 as
normal just as you shouldn't look at 2021 as normal. They're normalized somewhere in the middle.

Right. And maybe just to follow up on the reserve and provisioning, that's obviously been a big drag on profitability
as you grow the Platform business. But as you shrink Marcus, is there also any desire to kind of slow – I know
GreenSky is growing on balance sheet but the rest of the business, does that slow? Do we start to see
provisioning slow given how high your reserve levels already are? Just trying to get a better picture on how to
think about that cadence and maybe where your macro assumptions are in your reserve levels.

Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. So, as it relates to slowing growth, we actually did slow origination activity over the course of the fourth
quarter. Over the course of the year, we've implemented a number of changes to our credit underwriting,
tightening some of those provisions. And so, we actually did see a slowing of new originations. That being said,
the vast majority of the provision build was attributable to the existing balances as opposed to the new
originations. So, that's also something that we're going to watch very carefully as things develop.
You noticed our overall coverage ratio increasing. That's a function of what we've observed in our portfolio but as
well as our macroeconomic outlook and so we've made some adjustments which reflect our best estimates for
performance in the economy going forward.
