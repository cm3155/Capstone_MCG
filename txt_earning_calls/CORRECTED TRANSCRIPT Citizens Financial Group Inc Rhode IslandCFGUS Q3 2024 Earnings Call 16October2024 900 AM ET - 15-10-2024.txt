And with that, I will hand over to Bruce.

Bruce Winfield Van Saun
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Thanks, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We continue to execute well
through an uncertain environment. We've made good progress on our strategic initiatives. Our balance sheet
remains strong across capital, liquidity, funding, and loan reserves, and our profitability has stabilized and is
poised to move higher. Let me start with an update on our initiatives. First, the Private Bank delivered another
terrific quarter. We reached $5.6 billion in deposits, up from $4 billion in Q2, and our assets under management
reached $4.1 billion.
During the quarter, we opened two new Private Bank offices in the San Francisco Bay area and we added a new
private banking team to cover Southern California. We reached breakeven in August and September and expect
to be profitable in Q4 with good momentum entering 2025. Next, our commercial bank continues to demonstrate
its capacity to serve private capital well. For the quarter, we were number two in the league tables for sponsor
leveraged loan arrangements, and we remain number one over the past 12 months.
We continue to add quality talent to our coverage and our capital markets teams. Our New York City Metro
initiative continues to show nice growth. We have 5% year-on-year growth in households and 7% growth in
deposits. We look forward to being a key sponsor of the upcoming New York City Marathon as we continue to
raise our brand profile in the market. We've executed well on TOP 9 achieving a Q4 run rate benefit of $135
million, and we're finalizing the details of TOP 10, which should have a $100 million plus run rate benefit by end of
2025.
Our BSO actions continue to proceed as planned. Noncore reduced by $1 billion in the quarter and we continue to
use the liquidity generated to pay down higher cost funding like brokered CDs. We continue to execute actions in
commercial to exit lending only relationships and we're focused on our medium term plan to reduce our CRE
exposure. With respect to our balance sheet, our CET1 ratio is a 10.6%. Adjusting for OCI puts us at 9.2%. We
repurchased $325 million in stock during the quarter. And our spot LDR was 80.8% and our Federal Home Loan
Bank advances remained low at well under $1 billion.
We are not seeing much loan demand, but we remain hopeful that should start to pick up in coming quarters. Our
P&L was impacted by the drag from forward starting swaps, which commenced in July, as well as some fees that
pushed out to Q4. Nonetheless, we did a good job managing expenses and credit is performing broadly as
expected. Our Q4 guide shows a nice rebound in both NII and fees leading to positive operating leverage in the
quarter. We expect credit to remain broadly stable and we will continue to repurchase shares.
For the full year, we will hit most of our beginning of year guide with the exception of balance sheet volume
impacting NII and a modestly higher ACL build. We continue to have strong confidence in our medium term
outlook and we've added to the materials in the appendix to show more detail on our NIM progression. Lots of
uncertainty in the environment remains, but we feel good about our capacity to manage through that and continue
to execute on our broad strategy.
Our strategy rests on a transformed consumer bank, the best positioned super-regional commercial bank, and the
aspiration to have the premier bank owned Private Bank. We will continue to execute with the financial and
operating discipline that you've come to expect from us.

With that, let me turn it over to John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. As Bruce mentioned, third quarter saw continued strong execution
of our initiatives and importantly, we believe the third quarter represents a trough in earnings as new tailwinds,
strengthening fees, and continued expense discipline will result in positive operating leverage prospectively. We
continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with excellent liquidity and capital levels and a healthy credit reserve.
This positions us well to continue to execute on our strategic initiatives, which should help drive strong momentum
in 2025 and performance over the medium term. First, I'll start with some highlights of the third quarter financial
results referencing slides 5 and 6. We generated underlying net income of $392 million for the third quarter, EPS
of $0.79, and ROTCE of 9.7%. This includes a negative $0.11 impact from the noncore portfolio, which will
continue to steadily run off creating a tailwind for overall performance going forward. The Private Bank is making
strong progress towards profitability, reaching breakeven mid-third quarter and we expect it to start being
accretive to earnings in the fourth quarter.
Our capital position remains strong with CET1 at 10.6% at September 30 or 9.2% adjusted for the AOCI opt out
removal. And we executed $325 million in stock buybacks during the quarter. We also maintained a strong
funding and liquidity profile. Our pro forma LCR is 122%, which is well in excess of the large bank category one
requirement of 100%. And our period and LDR is 80.8%. Our ACL coverage ratio of 1.61% is down 2 basis points
from the prior quarter given that improved macroeconomic outlook and ongoing front book activity driving a mix
shift which lowered expected loss content in the loan portfolio.
We increased our General Office reserve to 12.1%, up from 11.1% in the prior quarter. Now, I'll talk to the third
quarter results in more detail, starting with net interest income on slide 7. NII is down 2.9% linked quarter,
primarily reflecting lower NIM and slightly lower interest earning assets. With respect to NIM, our margin was
down 10 basis points to 2.77%, largely reflecting the impact from the increase in hedge costs as forward starting
swaps kicked in during the quarter. Other NIM impacts were largely offsetting.
Moving to slide 8, our fees were down 2.7% linked quarter, with seasonality in capital markets and solid card and
wealth results. On the heels of a very strong second quarter, our capital markets fees decreased 30% as deal
activity slowed given seasonal trends and some M&A deals pushed into the fourth quarter. Year-on-year,
however, capital markets fees were up 40%, led by bond underwriting and M&A advisory fees. Our client hedging
revenue was down slightly as some clients delayed their interest rate hedging plans, given the potential for a
faster pace of rate cuts after the Fed eased aggressively in September.
Mortgage banking fees are down modestly, given a decline in MSR results net of hedging. This was offset by
securities gains we took in making adjustments for the investment portfolio. Our wealth fees were up slightly,
given growth in AUM from the Private Bank, which was somewhat offset by lower transactional sales activity. We
continue to focus on building out our wealth business in both our branch-based financial advisory activity, as well
as in private wealth, where we are adding teams at our Private Bank office geographies. Total assets under
management now approximate $30 billion.
On slide 9, we did a nice job on expenses which were down 1.3% linked quarter, notwithstanding continued
investment in our strategic initiatives. Our TOP 9 program is on target to deliver $135 million pre-tax run rate
benefit by the end of the year. And we are planning to launch our TOP 10 program, which will target more than

$100 million in run rate efficiencies by the end of 2025. We will provide more details for you on our next earning
call.
On slide 10, period-end loans are broadly stable and average loans are down 1% linked quarter reflecting limited
loan demand, as well as continued balance sheet optimization. We continue to run down the noncore portfolio to
the tune of about $1 billion in the quarter. The core loan portfolio was up about $800 million, with solid
contributions from the Private Bank and growth in retail, mortgage and home equity.
On a period-end basis, the Private Bank is making good progress, with loans up about $630 million to $2 billion.
Excluding the Private Bank, retail loans were up about $750 million, reflecting growth in mortgage and home
equity while commercial loans were down about $580 million, reflecting paydowns driven by corporates continuing
to issue in the debt markets, exits of lower returning credit-only relationships, and generally lower client loan
demand.
Next, on slides 11 and 12, we continued to do a good job on deposits in a very competitive and dynamic
environment.
Average deposits are broadly stable with period-end deposits down 1%, driven by the paydown of higher-cost
treasury deposits tied primarily to noncore rundown. This was partially offset by $1.6 billion of attractive growth in
Private Bank deposits. Our interest-bearing deposit costs were up 4 basis points linked quarter. However, total
deposit costs were up only 2 basis points, while total cost of funds was stable.
DDA balances were effectively flat linked quarter, with growth in the Private Bank being offset by lower
commercial. We anticipate that migration of lower- to higher-cost categories will drop off now that the Fed has
commenced the cutting cycle. Overall, our deposit franchise continues to perform well in a very competitive
environment. Our estimates indicate we ended the upgrade cycle with a terminal interest-bearing deposit beta
better than the peer average.
Our deposit franchise is highly diversified across product mix and channels. About 70% of our deposits are
granular, stable consumer deposits, and roughly 68% of our overall deposits are insured or secured.
Moving to credit on slide 13. Net charge-offs rose 2 basis points to 54 basis points, primarily reflecting seasonal
impacts in auto. A decline in commercial real estate charge-offs was offset by the resolution of several
nonperforming credits in C&I.
Nonaccrual loans increased 10% linked quarter, primarily reflecting an increase in CRE General Office as we
proceed with workout actions on a handful of loans. We believe we are near the peak of NPAs, as criticized
classified loans have been broadly stable for four quarters and loans and workout get resolved.
Turning to the allowance for credit losses on slide 14. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.61%, which is a 2-
basis-point decline from the prior quarter, reflecting an improving macroeconomic outlook and better loan mix,
given the runoff of the noncore auto portfolio and lower [ph] loss (00:13:22) content originations in retail, real
estate, secured, and commercial categories.
The General Office portfolio was down $150 million to $3.2 billion at the end of the third quarter. And our reserve
of $382 million represents 12.1% coverage, up from 11.1% in the second quarter. On the right side of the page,
you can see some of the key assumptions driving the General Office reserve coverage level. While rate cuts may
be beneficial at the margin, we continue to expect the sector to be challenged. We believe our current reserve

represents a severe scenario that is much worse than we've seen in historical downturns, so we feel the current
coverage is very strong.
Additionally, since the second quarter of 2023, we have absorbed $364 million of cumulative losses in the
General Office portfolio. When you add these cumulative losses to the reserve outstanding, this represents an
almost 20% loss rate based on a March 2023 balance of $4.1 billion. Over the past six quarters, we have
continued to work down the exposure to General Office with the portfolio down roughly $1 billion over the last 18
months to $3.2 billion at September 30th given paydowns of about $600 million, in addition to the charge offs I
just mentioned.
Moving to slide 15 and 16, we have maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio is a strong
10.6%, which compares with 10.7% in the prior quarter. And if you were to adjust for the AOCI opt out removal
under the current regulatory proposal, our CET1 ratio increased from 9% to 9.2%. Both CET1 and TCE ratios
have consistently been above the average of our peers. Given our strong capital position, we repurchased $325
million in common shares and including dividends, we returned a total of $516 million to shareholders in the third
quarter.
Moving to slide 17, our strategy is built on a transformed consumer bank, the best positioned commercial bank
among our regional peers and our aspiration to build the premier bank owned Private Bank and wealth franchise.
First, we have a strong transformed consumer bank with substantial wealth revenue potential that is set to drive
further deposit growth while efficiently managing costs. And we are well-positioned to continue gaining market
share in the important New York Metro market.
Next, we believe we have built a leading commercial bank among the super regional banks. We are focused on
serving sponsors and middle market companies in high growth sectors of the economy. Our investments over the
years in capital markets capabilities and coverage of the private capital space, have positioned us well to take
advantage when market activity picks up. With the Fed beginning to ease and fears of a recession subsiding, the
movement in our commercial client base is decidedly more positive, which has us optimistic that we'll see a strong
finish to the year and good momentum into 2025.
And we are pleased to report that for the third quarter in a row, our capital markets business sits the top of the
middle market lead tables, holding the number one sponsor middle market book runner position on a trailing 12
month basis.
Moving to the Private Bank, I'm pleased to report that the effort is going very well and continues to gain
momentum. We are growing our client base and now have about $5.6 billion of attractive deposits. This is a $1.6
billion increase from the prior quarter, with roughly 34% noninterest bearing. Also, we are now at $2 billion of
loans and continuing to grow.
We recently announced the addition of a top private banking team in Southern California and we have plans to
add new offices in the Bay Area, which adds to the offices we've already opened in San Francisco and Mill Valley,
California, Palm Beach and Boston. You should expect to see us opportunistically adding talent to bolster our
banking and wealth capabilities.
Notably our Private Bank revenue grew 64% to $49.7 million in the third quarter breakeven by mid quarter. We
are on track that our Private Bank to start contributing to earnings in the fourth quarter and add meaningfully to
EPS next year.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2024
Moving to slide 18, we provide a guide for the fourth quarter. This outlook contemplates a 25 basis point rate cut
in each of November and December. We expect NII to be up about 1.5% to 2.5%, driven primarily by a 5 basis
point improvement in net interest margin, reflecting the benefit of swaps given lower rates, deposit repricing,
noncore runoff, and favorable front book back book dynamics, partially offset by lower asset yields.
Spot loans should be up slightly paced by Private Bank and commercial sponsor activity. Noninterest income
should be up mid-to-high single digits, reflecting expected seasonal strength in capital markets. Our deal pipelines
are robust and we expect to see a strong finish to the year. We also expect modest improvements across other
key categories.
Noninterest expense is projected to be up about 2% and we expect to achieve positive operating leverage. Net
charge offs are expected to be broadly stable, while the ACL should continue to benefit from noncore runoff and
improving loan mix. Our CET1 ratio is expected to be broadly stable with about $200 million to $250 million of
share repurchases.
I call your attention to an updated slide in the appendix on our medium term NIM walk, which projects us to be in
the 3.25% to 3.4% range in 2027. To wrap up, we delivered a solid quarter in a dynamic environment with strong
results in capital markets, wealth and card, and credit performance that continues to play out largely as expected.
We are playing strong defense maintaining a robust capital and reserve position, a high level of liquidity and a
more structural long-term funding profile as we prepare for potential regulatory changes and any challenges the
environment may bring.
Importantly, we are also playing offense as we pursue our unique, multi-year strategic initiatives, which will drive
improving performance over the medium term. We remain confident in our ability to hit our medium term, 16% to
18% return target.
With that, I'll hand back over to Bruce.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2024
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the Q&A portion of the call. Your
first question comes – pardon me. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Scott Siefers
with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. John, I wanted to start up with a couple of questions, both
related to the margin progression and that medium term walk to which you alluded on slide 23, as we kind of start
to march upward. Maybe first in the immediate term, can you sort of walk through the puts and takes that allow for
the 5 basis points or so of margin expansion into the fourth quarter?
And then I guess, more importantly, as we sort of start the journey upward and think about that next year or so, it
looks like that 18 basis points of time based benefits is largely programmatic, which all else equal would get us to
like a $295 million. But of course the wildcards are like the timing of the ebbs and flows of the swaps and the rate
based impact. So maybe if you could sort of help, I guess, narrow the cone on the moving parts as we think about
the next few quarters, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, sure. Thanks for the question, Scott. I'd say starting off with the fourth quarter, I mean, I think when you
think about the progression there, one of the drivers – several drivers of tailwinds that we're seeing. First off, I
would highlight noncore, which continues to contribute about 2 basis points a quarter. And so that's the starting
point. I think the second big driver is broadly the active balance sheet management, fixed asset repricing, and
front book back book that continues to play out on – will continue to play out every quarter going forward and
that's a huge contributor.
I'll offer up one of the highlights of the balance sheet transition as you get into the fourth quarter also relates to
deposit migration. We've had negative deposit migration throughout the cycle that's been kind of declining over
time. And we're seeing late third quarter, early fourth quarter trends that tell us that that's going to flip around to
being more of a neutral, maybe a slightly positive going into the fourth quarter. And that's really significant, for that
to become less of a headwind that it's been and – given what's been going on in the past. I mean, I think
broadly...

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2024
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
...in here, John. But, we have the Private Bank continuing to generate very attractive deposits and they've been
growing well over $1 billion and $1.5 billion range the last two quarters. So that'll be positively benefiting that mix
and then typically seasonally in the fourth quarter, we'll see an uptick in both commercial and consumer in terms
of demand deposits. So, we're counting on that as part of the equation.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Absolutely. I think just playing on that a little further, I mean, I think, we are slight -the other big category. We are
slightly asset sensitive, but based on the noncore and those balance sheet trends that we just talked about, those
are more powerful and are – you got to keep in mind that the receipt swaps, which have been a headwind are
going to flip over to a tailwind and be a mitigant to our asset sensitivity going forward. So they'll actually contribute
into the fourth quarter.
And so one of the important things we're also doing is being extremely proactive on down betas. Just taking all
the learnings from prior cycles and what you've seen from our deposit portfolio where our deposit betas on the up
are now better than peer average from what we can sell. We're flipping all of that energy and capability into the
down beta management being highly proactive in the consumer side of things.
And on the commercial side, most of our deposits there are – the majority of them are 100% beta anyway. But
we're feeling really good about how we're really counting on this transition to a down rate cycle and all of that,
when you add all that up, that gives us confidence that we're going to achieve that 5 basis points. And as I may
have mentioned earlier, the late 3Q trends and the early 4Q trends are very consistent with that trajectory. So
that's the 4Q.
I think the second – there are similar themes, but the second question was, take me out to the fourth quarter of
2025. And you're right, if you look at the $277 million in 3Q, you're at the 18 basis, points that's really time based
and it's just really baked in, we'll get $295 million. And there's another, call it, I'd say in the neighborhood of 5-ish
basis points of benefit that we can really expect such that we can get in that neighborhood of 3% NIM in the fourth
quarter of 2025 and the drivers are very similar.
The tailwinds related to the growing front book back book and when you think about our fixed loan portfolio and
securities as that turns over under a wide range of rate scenarios, which is more kind of focused on longer end
rates, where the 10 year is going to end up in 5-year rates. We end up with anywhere from 200 basis points to
300 basis points of front book/back book benefit as that turns over every quarter. So over the next five quarters,
that's a driver that we feel very good about.
Our strategic initiatives on the deposit side with respect to Private Bank and New York Metro continue to
contribute. And when you add all that up, we end up with what we think is something nearing 3% by the end of
2025. And we saw a lot of down rate protection on. Keep in mind, we've got our – our swap portfolio is largely
intact through the middle of 2026. So we remain pretty well protected and slightly asset sensitive, but all those
other factors offset and give us a net positive as you get into the end of 2025.

Good morning. I guess just to...

Hi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
...drill down on the net interest income coming in weaker than kind of you thought maybe a month ago. Was that a
bigger Fed cut and a little bit less loan growth? And [indiscernible] (00:27:37) on the positive trends that you've
said is what we should expect from here, or was there something else to throw out there, too?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'd say, we are slightly asset sensitive, so 50 basis points, maybe a little bit more kind of than we expected.
But I'd say that the deposit trends in 3Q, the trajectory of low-cost migration came down during the quarter, but
maybe a little bit less than we expected. And so, I think we got to the end of the quarter where we expected, but
the average for the quarter in terms of migration was a little higher than we were thinking.
But as I mentioned, that is now flipping around. And as you look at the late September, early October trends that it
was almost – like the bell went off there when the Fed pulled the 50-basis-point lever. We really are seeing that
low-cost migration really flip to more of a neutral to slight positive. And so that's really what you can see going into
4Q.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And then, yeah, on volume, too, I think we anticipated a little more loan growth that – I'd say, we had nice loan
growth in the Private Bank, but not maybe quite as much as we thought. I think that's really just timing. And as
rates come down, that'll continue to pick up. Similarly on commercial bank, we thought we'd see a little faster
rebound in line utilization, particularly on the sponsor side. We're starting to see that. So again, I think that's kind
of on the come and should – that's why we have an outlook in the guide that fourth quarter we should start to see
slight growth in our spot loans, even comprehending the noncore rundown.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then separately, how do you think about operating leverage kind of more medium term? Obviously, like
net interest income is going to be a bigger driver dollar-wise. If we just look at fourth quarter to kind of frame it,
you're guiding to revenues up about 3.5% versus costs up [ph] 2% (00:29:36). So, 150 bps of operating leverage,
but that's more driven by fees. So just thoughts on medium term, how much operating leverage would you
envision?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean, I think we'll talk more about this in January, but, I mean, I think we have significant opportunity for
operating leverage. When you look at the net interest margin reflating to that 3.25% to 3.40% range provides
significant tailwinds and consistent operating leverage over time. We'll come back in January and frame that for
you a little more in terms of what we expect in 2025.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
The nice thing about the NIM reflation is there's no real cost of goods sold in terms of impact on expenses, so that
pretty much drops straight through. I think there's clearly going to be continued growth in fees led by capital
markets. Some of the things we're doing in the payments business, some of the exciting developments in our
wealth business, but those usually come with payouts and investments on the expense side. But nonetheless, I
think the positive – operating leverage should be quite positive when we look out over that 2025 to 2027 period.
Brendan, maybe you could add a couple of comments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Vice Chairman & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
One other comment I'd mention on the Private Bank is just remember that the cost base that we're working our
way through right now is, yeah, fixed on the short-term basis with comp guarantees we've given to the team. So
as the revenue grows, we're kind of earning our way through the comp guarantees. So that's all straight positive
operating leverage linked quarter, where the revenue is coming without necessarily incremental expenses
because we've essentially put that in; and over time, that will, let's say, work their way through the guarantee.
When we get the right scale, they'll grow with further linkage together. But right now, it's a straight revenue growth
on top of a fixed expense base.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Hi.

Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Bruce, you just talked about the loan growth dynamics a bit. And maybe if you could just elaborate a little bit more
on your confidence in that you're seeing this inflection in demand here that should drive a modest growth in fourth
quarter. What is the bigger catalyst? Is it the rate cut, is it clarity you expect around the election? And then can
you maybe help us think about where like the type of acceleration in overall loan growth that you expect you could
see going into or as you look at 2025? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Let me let me start and then I'm going to pass it to Don and Brendan to talk about their segments and their
outlooks. But we're not calling for any heroics here in fourth quarter. So I think the guide is pretty much de-risked
from needing significant step up in loan growth. But it is, I think, worth noting that we're starting to see things build
a bit. We said our biggest quarterly increase in the Private Bank and the pipelines looking pretty good. So, I think
that will continue.
And I think there, as rates come down, folks are willing to transact and borrow. I think it's a similar thing in the
commercial bank where there's lots of interest in private equity, kind of starting to realize some exits and put some
money to work. So we see it by the amount of conversations that we're privy to with clients, but it's starting to
build. But it really the dam has not broken yet and so I think we'll see that trend continue to flexed up with. Let me
start first with Don and then maybe Brendan you could pick up second.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree Q
Senior Vice Chair & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I think you said it, Bruce, the leader in the clubhouses subscription lines where we saw some very strong
growth late quarter and we're continuing to see it into the fourth quarter. And that's not really leveraged by us that
we're doing is just activity in the private equity space that we're seeing build. And we've seen a pretty nice
utilization bump in that business.
We haven't really seen it in C&I yet, but the conversations we're having with our core C&I clients, particularly in
the middle market, with the economy kind of stabilizing, rates coming down, there's just a general level of
confidence that the business environment is going to be better as we get into 2025. And that will result in more
working capital utilization, more investment in their businesses.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2024
And remember, one of the things John said, one of the downdrafts we've had against kind of core loan growth has
been a lot of activity where companies have been refinancing in the public securities markets. So, we've seen
stuff that's been on our balance sheet being refinanced, been good for our fee lines. But it's put a little bit of
pressure on core asset levels. So, we think a lot of that is behind us now. So, the net growth we'll see in the core
book should begin to grow as we get into 2025.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Okay. Brendan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Vice Chairman & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll quickly hit on consumer and then private banking. On the consumer side, I would remind folks that the
pace of rundown on noncore is turning into a net positive. So, last year at this time, we were running off $1.2
billion, $1.3 billion a quarter. And now we're in the consumer book and now we're in the $800 million to $900
million. So that's the linked quarter rundown is slowing a bit. And that will continue into the future.
And we look at the growth portfolios, we're seeing decent growth in mortgage and home equity. And as rates pull
back a little bit, we expect to see a modest pickup in mortgage originations activity. But as everybody knows, the
majority of the country is locked into 3%-ish mortgage rates. And so our HELOC business is incredibly well
positioned. We've got a real strength in that business where we're at the very top of the league tables and
national HELOC originations in the super prime space and you'll continue to see that grow.
And I believe that product, it will be a main lever for US consumers as the economy gets more confidence in
footing for consumers to borrow against record equity in their homes. That's been built up over the last five or six
years. So, we expect that to continue. The other headwind moving to a tailwind is likely student in a modest way
with high rates. The student loan refinance product has been all but sidelined.
And now with the federal government now collecting payments again on that portfolio and rates coming back
down, we should see more late 20s, early 30 year olds who have great credit coming back in the money that see
value and restructuring their student loan debt. So, we're expecting that to modestly pick up as we get into next
year.
On the Private Bank side, it's a little bit of the same story, rates pulling back, should really put more customers in
attractive place to use credit. And right now we're seeing a lot of cash transactions, whether it's on the resi side or
businesses sitting on the sidelines. And we're hearing very strong feedback that as rates pull back, they'll be more
comfortable using credit versus just going cash temporarily on whether it's an investment home or facilitating
business growth, given the high net worth – an ultra-high net worth profile of our customer base.
So we've got good confidence that the rate dynamic should drive a decent amount of embedded demand. And as
everybody knows, we've also went to market very strong on the deposit side and we've been very focused on
getting the operations up. There's a progression here on earning the customer's full wallet of do the day to day
banking really well. Now they'll come from borrowing needs and then we'll build a dislodge wealth. So there's a
natural sort of earned wallet share gain that we anticipate getting as we get into next year on the private banking
side that will be supported by the rate environment.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2024
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Great. Thanks. And then the quick second one on credit. Could you just talk about the confidence – I
believe you indicated that you've seen, you believe, NPAs are peaking here at this quarter. Maybe your
confidence there, what gives you that? And then also on the confidence in the broadly stable charge offs with the
third quarter, as you look at fourth quarter. I know auto delinquencies were up pretty sharply year-over-year, so
that would be beyond the seasonality. So I'm interested in what drove that and then thoughts on the reserve going
forward. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Maybe I'll start and then we'll pass it around. Whoever wants to jump in, feel free. But yeah, I'd say the big
issue that's well known that we've been managing through is the General Office portfolio and that one is going to
– it's a multi-quarter workout that has commenced in 2023. It's with us all through 2024. It'll be with us for a good
chunk of 2025 and we think we've got our arms fully around that.
We've got very heavy reserves there. We've got our best people working with borrowers to try to come up with
mutually satisfactory outcomes. But the timing of when you recognize the charge offs and when something might
go, NPA moves around a bit and it's not always in our control. If a borrower decides to put a property up for sale
then there are certain actions we have to take in terms of NPA recognition or charge off recognition.
So this quarter, we were on the low end of CRE charge offs and we had a blip in CRE NPAs. But having said that,
the problem loan population that we're managing is pretty consistent. And so one of the things we take comfort in
is when we look at criticized and classified loans across the board and commercial, they've been pretty stable
now for four quarters. So that's the big thing. I'll see, Don, if you want to add any color on the...

I think that's exactly right, Bruce. I think that we've seen like zero surprises in our credit folks for the last four
quarters, and it's playing out exactly as we thought it was going to play out. And as Bruce said, we'll have charge

offs going through the General Office portfolio for the next several quarters. But it's pretty much playing out as we
expected. We had a little bit of a blip in C&I charge offs this quarter, which was things that have been in the
workout teams for literally five, six, seven years, and they just happen to resolve this quarter.
So, I don't worry a lot about NPA moves. What I focus on is the [ph] credit class (00:40:13) levels and the fact that
those have been stable. The other thing we're seeing in the general real estate area is not in General Office but in
general real estate. There's a lot of liquidity coming back into the marketplace. So, it's accelerating our ability to
move down the overall exposures in the book, which, you know, as a strategic matter is something that I want to
do.
And we're seeing nothing in the C&I book and broadly that is disturbing to us at all. It's quite healthy from a overall
credit standpoint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Vice Chairman & Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Consumer is broadly normalized in pre-COVID, we were between 50 basis points and 55 basis points in
net charge offs and that's where we are now. And while there's always a little bit of puts and takes, there's nothing
that we're observing in the portfolio that's making me lose any sleep. And your question on auto, a couple of
comments. One would be, last quarter was – on the charge off side was very low seasonally impacted. But also
we had a very strong recovery month in used car values.
So this quarter was much more just a reversion to the mean. The other dynamic I would mention in auto, it's tough
to read into published delinquency numbers even though our delinquency is relatively in check. But when you're
not originating anymore, it takes 12 to 18 months for a vintage curve to build up to its appropriate steady state in
delinquency. So, when you shut the spigot off on new originations, it's just a denominator issue that you've got
other originations, vintages that are normally progressing along their lines to our ultimate expected loss number.
And you're not getting the denominator benefit of a bunch of new flow coming in as zero delinquencies. So, when
you decompose all that, there's really nothing that we're worried about whatsoever in the auto portfolio. It's
performing exactly as we priced it and exactly as we've expected it to.

Hi. Good morning. My first question is for you, John. On the 10-Q, you had $30 billion of notional receive-
fixed/pay SOFR swaps for both 3Q and 4Q and $30.9 billion for 2025. Obviously, slide 24 would indicate lower
notional. Could you give us an update on whether you terminated those swaps and maybe confirm the accounting

for the swaps in that you would just – those losses are crystallized and they would be in your NII for the duration
of the swap life.
And then, just as a follow-up, you mentioned a 3% NIM by 4Q 2025. How many rate cuts would you need to
ensure yourself of getting to that 3% level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, I'll take those. So, yeah, I think during the third quarter, as you may recall, there was a period of time when
the yield curve was discounting as many as seven or eight cuts. Over through the second quarter of next year is
pretty aggressive expectation of the pace of Fed rate cuts. We happen to have about $4 billion of short-dated
receive-fixed swaps that were maturing in May of 2025.
And so, what we opportunistically chose to do was to terminate $4 billion of swaps during the third quarter in an
environment where there was approximately seven or eight cuts that we locked in that benefit, given the swaps
were very short dated and really were only providing down rate protection through May. We felt like that that was
a good risk/reward to lock in that benefit and lock in the contribution and protection against the lower rates that
the swaps were there to cover in the first place.
Out the window, there are fewer cuts through May. So, at least at this point, that was a round trip positive for us to
move on from those swaps. And they did exactly what they were intended to do was to create that protection. The
accounting aspects of it are that we amortize the impact of that over the remaining life of those swaps through
May. So that'll be amortized through. But that impact will be again a lower impact or a more favorable impact than
otherwise would be the case if we were to have held the swaps. And so that was the point of the terminations. So
that's that one.
And I think the second question was about the 3%...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
How many cuts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
...and the rate environment that we would – there's a range of rate environments that would still be consistent with
that. I mean, I would say that we have a slightly asset-sensitive position. So net interest margin is stable across a
range of rate environments into 2025, given the swap portfolio doesn't begin to drop off until mid-2026.
So, I mean, the forward curve out the window implies getting to around 3.50% by the end of 2025, but we would
be able to achieve that 3% at rate environments that would be below that level as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And my follow-up question is twofold. First, could you explain the more favorable impact. I think I was
thinking that as I amortize that impact of the terminated swap, it would just be the difference between the SOFR
and receive-fixed rate through May 2025. So, John, maybe give us some insight on what the more favorable
treatment would be.

And then just secondly, just wanted to follow up. I think that there were a lot of questions over being able to
achieve that NIM expansion for next quarter, which you've explained well. I just wanted to sort of nail down what
kind of deposit beta you are assuming in that 2.82% number for next quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yes. So – again, so when you terminate the swap, you basically terminate based upon the forward curve that's
assumed at the time. And so the forward curve at that time...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay, got it. That's the difference. Got it. Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Yeah.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Understood.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And so – yes, got it. And then the – on the NIM expansion into the fourth quarter, highly proactive focus on this is
going to get our deposit beta to be up to around – nearing 40% by the end of the quarter. You've got all of the
100% beta stuff in commercial leading the way, but we're being highly proactive in consumer as well and just
really taking all the learnings over the cycle over the last many years and applying that to how we continue to be
able to drive solid deposit growth at a really attractive cost of funds. So, that's the number that's baked in, about
40% deposit beta in 4Q.

Hey. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the deposit beta question. Do you have any more specifics on what
your spot deposit rates are now that we're a month past the Fed rate cuts? And how you expect that deposit beta
to project as we get further into the Fed rate cut cycle, right? As more Fed rate cuts are behind us, does that
make it easier or more difficult to continue to drop your deposit rates going forward?

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2024
John F. Woods A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Well, I mean, I think if you kind of do the math there, if you – based on the forward curve from the – the forward
curve that will have two more Fed cuts in 4Q. And we're using a curve that was after nonfarm payrolls from a
week or two ago. But after nonfarm payrolls, you got the two cuts based on that curve. And if you apply a 40%
beta to what you think the average SOFR rate would be in 4Q versus 3Q, you can come up with the decline in
interest bearing deposit costs on that basis. And second question, what was the second part of that question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
The second part of the question was just, as we get into, say, the middle of next year and we have the series of
Fed rate cuts behind us. Does that make it easier to continue to drop deposit rates or does it make it harder to
drop deposit rates because there's fewer cuts in the forward curve from there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I think the way to think about that is the longer the down cycle lasts, the more you can continue to contribute to
ongoing lowering of deposit costs. But broadly, I think what we've said in the past was that our down cycle betas
are going to approximate our upcycle beta, so around 50% to 55%. And so we're going to be around 40% by the
end of the fourth quarter and it'll gradually migrate to that 50% to 55% over the cutting cycle that's going to
proceed over the – in the coming years. And so you can kind of think about that gradual improvement in that way I
think.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. But there was acceleration in the upcycle towards the later part of the cycle, which I think you mirror that on
the down cycle.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. That's right. Exactly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. That's what I was getting to. That's really helpful. And then maybe just on the front book back book, I think
you noted that 200 basis point to 300 basis point spread benefit. Can you talk about what balances we should
apply that to, what are the fixed rate securities and loans coming due over the next year or so? And is there any
room to use some of the excess capital for any securities repositioning from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean, I think that's a good metric to use that this will be growing over time. So, when you see that the
activity in loan growth picking up over time, you're going to see this being a contributor over the next couple of
years. I mean, I'd say that the – what turns over in the back book on a quarterly basis in resi mortgage, call it,
around $750 million a quarter. And that's a similar number for securities as well when you talk about what turns

over, those are the balances that you would apply it to is the front book back book. But that'll continue to
contribute and build on itself over the next couple of years.

Manan Gosalia Q

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chair & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I mean, that's not in our plans. I mean we'll look at, we actively manage the securities portfolio and on an ongoing
basis, but we don't have a large single repositioning.

Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)

of.
