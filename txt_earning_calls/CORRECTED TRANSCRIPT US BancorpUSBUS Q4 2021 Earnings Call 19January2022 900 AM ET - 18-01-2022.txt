Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Welcome to U.S. Bancorp's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Following a review of the
results by Andy Cecere, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Terry Dolan, Vice Chair and Chief
Financial Officer, there will be a formal question-and-answer session.
[Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded and available for replay beginning today at 11:00 AM Central
Time through Wednesday, January 26, 2022, at 10:59 PM Central Time.
I will now turn the conference call over to Jen Thompson, Director of Investor Relations and Economic Analysis
for U.S. Bancorp.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Ann Thompson
Executive Vice President, Director-Investor Relations and Economic Analysis, U.S. Bancorp
Thank you, Natalia, and good morning, everyone. With me today are Andy Cecere, our Chairman, President, and
CEO; and Terry Dolan, our Chief Financial Officer. During their prepared remarks, Andy and Terry will be
referencing a slide presentation. A copy of the slide presentation, as well as our earnings release and
supplemental analyst schedules, are available on our website at USbank.com.
I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made during today's call are subject to risk and
uncertainty. Factors that could materially change our current forward-looking assumptions are described on page
2 of today's presentation, in our press release, and in our Form 10-K and subsequent reports on file with the SEC.
I'll now turn the call over to Andy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Jen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Following our prepared remarks, Terry
and I will take any questions you have. I'll begin on slide 3.
In the fourth quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.07 and generated total revenue of $5.7 billion. We saw
strong balance sheet growth this quarter, including deposit growth of over $18 billion, or 4.3%, compared with the
third quarter. Average loans grew by 2% linked quarter, or 2.7% excluding the impact of loan forgiveness related
to PPP.
We are encouraged by the loan growth momentum, and we have a positive outlook for 2022, given improving
client sentiment and business conditions, and continued strength in certain focus commercial portfolios, such as
ABS lending and supply chain financing.
The significant increase in liquidity provided by the strong deposit inflows this quarter puts us in a favorable
position to support future balance sheet growth. Deposit growth provided the opportunity for tactical investment in
cash management strategies that pressured the net interest margin for the fourth quarter, but was both accretive
to net interest income and maintained asset sensitivity for our rising rate environment.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
Turning to fees. Underlying client acquisition and market share trends across our business lines were healthy,
and payment sales trends continue to improve on a year-over-year basis. This quarter, we released $145 million
of loan loss reserves, reflecting continued strong credit quality, including a record low net charge-off ratio.
In the lower right quadrant, you can see that our book value per share totaled $32.71 at December 31, which was
1.5% higher than September 30. Our CET1 capital ratio was 10% at December 31.
Slide 4 provides key performance metrics. Slide 5 highlights trends in digital engagement. Digital transactions
now account for over 80% of total transactions and digital loan sales account for two-thirds of total loan sales.
Turning to slide 6, we continue to believe our initiatives aimed at connecting our banking customers with our
payment products and our services, and our payments customers with our banking products and services will
allow us to grow our small business relationships by 15% to 20% and related revenue by 25% to 30% over the
next few years.
Now, let me turn the call over to Terry, who will provide more detail on the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Andy. If you turn to slide 7, I'll start with the balance sheet review, followed by a discussion of fourth
quarter earnings trends.
Average loans increased 2.0% compared with the third quarter, driven by a 2.6% increase in commercial loans,
which benefited from new business activity and improved utilization rates. Retail loan growth was driven primarily
by higher credit card balances, growth in residential mortgages, and strong production of installment loans,
including auto lending.
At December 31, PPP loan balances totaled $1.4 billion compared to $2.4 billion at September 30. Excluding PPP
loans, fourth quarter average loans grew by 2.7% on a linked quarter basis.
Turning to slide 8, total average deposits increased by $18.4 billion, or 4.3%, compared with the third quarter. We
continued to see favorable mix shift with average noninterest-bearing deposits increasing by 5.4% and average
savings deposits increasing by 4.4%, while higher cost time deposits decreased by 3.0%.
Slide 9 shows credit quality trends. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 0.28% at
December 31, compared with 0.32% at September 30 and 0.44% a year ago. Our fourth quarter net charge-off
ratio of 0.17% improved on both a linked quarter and year-over-year basis. Borrower liquidity and stronger asset
valuations continued to support repayment and recovery of problem loans.
Our reserve release was $145 million this quarter, primarily reflecting strong credit quality metrics. Our allowance
for credit losses as of September (sic) [December] 31 totaled $6.2 billion, or 1.97% of loans.
Slide 10 provides an earnings summary. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we earned $1.07 per diluted share. These
results included a reserve release of $145 million.
Turning to slide 11, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis of $3.2 billion came in a little higher
than our expectations. The $47 million decrease compared with the third quarter was driven by a $82 million
decline in PPP interest and fees, partially offset by earning asset growth.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
Our net interest margin declined by 13 basis points on a linked quarter basis to 2.40%. The net interest margin
decline was related to a 6 basis point impact from lower PPP loan interest and fees, and a 6 basis point impact
from elevated liquidity and related investment portfolio and cash management strategies aimed at optimizing our
asset sensitivity going into 2022.
Slide 12 highlights trends in noninterest income. Compared with the year ago, noninterest income declined by
0.6% as compared – as strong growth in payments revenue, trust and investment management fees, deposit
service charges, and commercial product revenue was more than offset by a decrease in mortgage revenue,
reflecting the interest rate environment and lower securities gains and other fee revenue.
On a linked quarter basis, noninterest income declined by 5.9%, primarily reflecting the seasonally lower
payments and capital markets revenues and declining mortgage banking revenue, as expected.
Slide 13 provides information on our payment services businesses. Sales volumes in each of our three
businesses exceeded pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter, despite some Omicron-related softness in late
December.
We expect year-over-year payments momentum to continue into 2022 as lagging sectors such as airline,
hospitality, and corporate T&E benefit from a continued cyclical recovery toward pre-pandemic levels, and as our
multiyear investments in e-commerce and tech-led drive secular growth improvements.
As we saw in our earnings press release this morning, effective January 3, US Bank has eliminated fees for
certain non-sufficient funds. We believe this is not only the right thing to do for customers, but it is a smart
business decision.
For some time, we have been at the forefront of using digital technology to help our customers avoid overdraft
charges, and our efforts have helped our customers more easily and effectively manage their money, which has
contributed to increased customer satisfaction. This latest move is simply the next step in the process.
Turning to slide 14, noninterest expense increased by $104 million, or 3.0%, compared with the third quarter. This
increase was driven by higher medical claims within employee benefit expense and higher professional services
expenses, higher marketing and business development costs. Tax credit amortization expense was also higher in
the fourth quarter, in line with typical seasonal trends.
Slide 15 highlights our capital position. Our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio at December 31 was 10.0%, which
decreased slightly compared with September 30, driven by risk-weighted asset growth and the impact of
acquisitions completed near the end of the quarter.
As a reminder, at the beginning of the third quarter, we suspended our share buyback program due to our recent
announcement that we have agreed to acquire Union Bank.
We continue to expect that our share repurchase program will be deferred until the second half of 2022. After the
closing of the acquisition, we expect to operate at a CET1 capital ratio between our target ratio and 9.0%. I will
now provide some forward-looking guidance.
We expect both net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis, as well as our net interest margin to be
relatively stable on a linked quarter basis, with growth expected in subsequent quarters. Under our base case

scenario, which incorporates three rate hikes, we expect full year 2022 net interest income on a taxable-
equivalent basis to increase at a mid-single-digit pace.
We expect mortgage revenue to be slightly lower in the first quarter on a linked quarter basis, in line with slower
refinancing activity in the market.
Payments revenue is seasonally lower in the first quarter. On a year-over-year basis, we expect total revenue to
increase at a high-single-digit pace, driven by double-digit growth in both merchant processing revenue and
corporate payments revenue. We expect credit card revenue to be stable on a year-over-year basis as high-
single-digit growth in credit and debit card fees is offset by lower prepaid processing fees.
Excluding the prepaid headwind, which will abate after the first quarter, we expect total payment revenue to
increase at a low teen rate on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter. We expect other revenue to approximate
$125 million to $150 million per quarter over the course of 2022.
We expect expenses to be relatively stable in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter. Credit quality
remains strong. Over the next few quarters, we expect the net charge-off ratio to remain lower than historical
levels, but will normalize over time as the effects of the pandemic continue to subside.
For the full year 2022, we expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 21.0%.
I will hand it back to Andy for closing comments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Terry. Fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations, and we are starting off the year with
momentum building across our lending and fee businesses.
We feel good about the trajectory of loan growth and are well positioned to benefit from a rising rate environment.
We expect client acquisition growth and account penetration to drive market share gains across our fee
businesses. In particular, we believe 2022 will be another good year for our payments business.
Due to the Omicron surge, year-over-year sales growth have slowed somewhat in the past few weeks from the
exceptionally strong pace we saw in the second half of 2021. However, growth rates remain strong, and we
believe this will likely prove to be a speed bump rather than an extended slowdown. Nonetheless, the situation is
fluid, and we'll continue to monitor trends closely and update you along the way.
Our investments in technology to support our digital transformation and payments ecosystem initiatives are
paying off, and we continue to look for uses of capital that would drive higher returns.
In the fourth quarter, we acquired TravelBank, a fintech that provides tech-driven expense and travel
management solutions to help businesses manage their operations more efficiently. Also in the fourth quarter, we
closed on the acquisition of PFM Asset Management, which not only increased our assets under management,
but has enhanced our position in a niche area within the money market world.
We are looking forward to closing our previously announced acquisition of Union Bank later this year. The
addition of Union Bank will increase our scale, improve our market share in a demographically attractive market,
and add over 1 million Consumer clients and over 190,000 Business Banking customers to whom we can offer

our leading digital capabilities and our expansive product set. The strategic and financial benefits of this
combination will accrue to shareholders over many years.
But the numbers only tell part of the U.S. Bank's story. As we start a new year, I want to emphasize that how we
do things will continue to be as important as what we do. And so, in closing, I'd like to thank our employees who
come in every day with the goal of doing the right thing for our customers, our communities, their fellow
employees, and our constituents.
Thank you for helping to make 2021 a successful year and position us well for the future. We will now open up the
call to Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Morning, everybody. Thank you for taking my question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning, Scott.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Let's see. Maybe, Terry, I was hoping you could please discuss in just a bit more detail your updated
thoughts on rate sensitivity, given some of the changes in the balance sheet in the fourth quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So, we had the opportunity, because of the deposit flows, to be able to both invest in investment securities
to help a little bit in terms of the fourth quarter, but we also at the same time utilized hedging strategies to keep
the duration of those purchases relatively short.
And the expectation, Scott, is that when long-term rates rise, which we're starting to see now, that we're going to
be able to unwind those swaps and be able to take advantage of the rising rate environment. So, we did all of that
fundamentally to be able to maintain as much asset sensitivity going into 2022 as we possibly could.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect. Okay, good. Thank you. And then, perhaps either for Andy or Terry, maybe just a thought or comment
regarding the anticipated kind of composition of loan growth through 2022. It certainly sounds like a constructive
outlook, but maybe just kind of Commercial versus Consumer as you see it.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So, maybe I'll just kind of start with fourth quarter. One of the things we saw in the fourth quarter, not only
strong Consumer continuing, but the C&I portfolio actually starting to expand very nicely. And we talked a little bit
about that.
So, as we look into 2022, we continue to expect that consumer credit is going to continue to strengthen. Auto
lending may be a little bit more moderate than it was in 2022, but I think credit card continues to be very strong as
payment rates come down. And then, we also would expect that residential mortgage portfolio loans would be
growing.
But I think the real story is that we're now starting to see a nice shift with respect to the commercial and the C&I
portfolios. We're continuing to see growth in certain segments, like asset-backed securitization, lending, some of
those sorts of things that we saw earlier in the year.
But in the fourth quarter – in the end of the fourth quarter, we saw nice expansion of utilization rates. I think it was
like 60 basis points on average third versus fourth quarter, but in December, it was up almost 2.5%. And we
would expect to kind of see that.
I think the other thing I would say is that sentiment on the commercial side, people are rebuilding their inventories.
I think, from a supply chain perspective, they still have some concerns about that, and so I think that they're being
cautious about making sure that they have inventory to be able to run their business. And I think they're starting to
make business investment ahead of the consumer spend that they see and the economic growth that they see in
2022.
So, Andy, what would you add?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Terry, I think you hit the high points. And two changes in trends in the fourth quarter that look positive going into
2022, Scott. Number one, as Terry mentioned, the increase in utilization rates, which we haven't seen for a
number of quarters. And secondly is the start of the decline in payment rates, which helps credit card volumes.
So, those are two positives I'd call out as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect. All right. Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
Good morning, Terry. Good morning, Andy. Andy, coming back to the big transaction that, obviously, you guys
are doing, you touched on all the benefits that Union Bank will bring to the table to U.S. Bancorp.
Can you share with us what the update is on the regulatory approval process? There's a lot of, obviously,
uncertainty in Washington today at the Fed and other regulatory agencies with new heads coming in over time.
Maybe an update. Could this be delayed? What is the risk of it just being delayed getting the approval?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, thanks, Gerard. So, we submitted our application in early October. We've been working with Union Bank,
and we have a number of acquisition teams, both on our side, as well as the Union Bank side, working on
integration activities, including technology, as well as the business lines.
And we've been responding and working with the regulators in terms of questions on the submission, which is
normal course for this process. So, we continue to believe that this will close in the first half. It may be later in the
first half, but that's our continued belief with a conversion in the late third quarter or September/October
timeframe.
So, nothing to have us believe that it would be any different from that, and we're preparing for that timeframe.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Obviously there's a lot of discussion on your call and other calls about asset sensitivity and what the outlook is for
this year. But pivoting for a moment, I'm kind of looking at what we're all going to be talking about on the fourth
quarter call for 2022 in January of 2023. And I got a sense it might be more about credit than it is today.
And you guys have stood out as being some of the best underwriters in the industry. Can you share with us what
are you seeing out there in terms of underwriting from your competitors? Are people getting more aggressive to
generate revenue – loan growth? Or, no, everybody's still pretty conservative?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, Gerard, I think what I would – the way I would kind of describe it, from our perspective, we haven't changed
our credit box really at all. We really tried to underwrite through the cycle. I think that there has been a lot of
competition in the industry for loan growth over the last 12 months.
And as you know, when the cycle turns, it's the decisions you made today that are going to end up impacting you
two or three years down the road. So, I do think that credit normalizes as we go through the year. I don't know if
we quite get back to where we were pre-pandemic, but I think that it will start to migrate in that direction.

I would say that if there is loosening from an underwriting perspective, maybe stretching a little bit more with
respect to structure. But it has been competitive, both from an underwriting perspective, as well as from a pricing
perspective out there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And just to follow up on that quickly, Terry. How about exceptions? Are you seeing more exceptions to the credit
underwriting box to get deals done?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Again, from our perspective, we really haven't changed our approach at all. Again, I think from a competitive
standpoint, again, they're focused on being as competitive as they possibly can in terms of the underwriting and
their structures and their pricing. But from our perspective, we haven't really changed our approach.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Hi. Good morning, guys. Andy, maybe from a high-level perspective, you might not want to give specific guidance,
but just kind of your thoughts about the revenue and expense dynamics that you're looking at heading into 2022.
Maybe some thoughts on the revenue headwinds and tailwinds that you're looking at, and how you plan on
managing inflation on the expense base. And just kind of overall, how does operating leverage feel as a goal for
this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure, John. And Terry gave a little guidance on net interest income for the year, but I will talk about the full
balance sheet and income statement. We continue to expect mid-single-digit earning asset growth for the year.
That loan momentum that we talked about looks positive going into 2022. We would expect revenue growth of 3%
to 4%, John, on a full year basis, as well as positive operating leverage of at least 100 basis points for 2022.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Got it. And then, maybe just a question on the NII guide, Terry. You mentioned three hikes. Just what's the
cadence of what you've built in on that? And is there any rule of thumb for what one Fed hike of 25 basis points
does to the NIM or NII, everything else equal? That might be helpful for us. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So, our base case, as we said, bakes in three rate hikes really starting in the second quarter, and then kind
of, as you might expect, through the rest of the year. If you go back to just our disclosures at the end of third
quarter, it really hasn't changed a lot. A 50 basis point shock is about 3.5% from a net interest income standpoint.
So, I would kind of refer you back to that. If you think about three rate hikes kind of on that pace, you're probably
talking about the equivalency of about a 35 basis point shock. So, if you're kind of doing the math, you can kind of
go to that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
And, Terry, all those numbers are the impacts of net interest income. In addition, we have our waivers, which total
about $70 million a quarter, John. And you get about two-thirds of that back at the first rate hike of 25 basis points
and about 90% of it back at the second rate hike.

John E. McDonald Q

Betsy L. Graseck Q

Hey. Couple of questions. Just on the guide, a couple of clean-ups. The NII, mid-single-digit pace, is that a Q-on-

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Right. Right. Right. Okay. All right, just wanted to make sure. And then when I'm thinking about the positive
operating leverage of at least 100 basis points, that's obviously a nice uptick from what you've been doing
recently. Can you – over the past couple years, I guess.
Can you kind of highlight, is this a function of the rate environment being better primarily? Or is it also from some
of the investment spend that you've been making that you are leveraging and basically able to switch on the
optimization side of the investment spend?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Betsy, I would say, it's kind of a combination of both. I mean, the improving revenue environment certainly
helps that. But we have been, as you say, making some significant investment in digital capabilities. And as that
investment matures, we kind of fully expect that we would see some operating efficiencies on the expense side.
We have been working through tech modernization, which that helps us. And we're always looking for kind of –
from a continuous improvement point of view, trying to optimize the branch network, as well as our operations.
So, I think it's a combination of both.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And on the investment spend side, there'll be some in integrating Union Bank, of course. But beyond that,
where would you be targeting investment dollars from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I think that when we think about our technology investment continuing to have investment in our mortgage
business and our digital mobile app capabilities, but a strong focus on real-time payments, money movement, and

on the whole B2B side of the equation is going to be important. And then, of course, we've been talking about the
ecosystem between our payments business and our Business Banking, and so we'll continue to make investment
there.
So, I think it's kind of a continuation of many of the same themes that we've had over the last year. On a core
basis, we really don't expect any significant increase in the investment levels, but we continue to expect that we
will maintain those investment levels going forward.

Hi. Good morning, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A

Good morning, Ken.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
A couple NII clean-ups, please. So, you mentioned that PPP was an $80 million decline, which I think was bigger
than what you had anticipated previously at $60 million to $70 million. I'm just wondering what kind of PPP decline
do you still have in that first quarter outlook for NII flat sequentially.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So, I mean, the decline from third to fourth quarter was the most significant. It was a little bit higher than
what we had expected. Part of that is because some of what we had expected to occur in 2022 actually kind of
got pulled forward into the fourth quarter. Currently in our baseline or our expectation is that there will be a very
immaterial decline in PPP going from fourth to first. It's about $15 million, $16 million, so it's pretty insignificant.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And is that the last kind of meaningful step-down from there? Does it pretty much wind out from there? Just
trying to get to like that baseline where we can move past the PPP.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Really, we look at 2022 as being past PPP in all respect. So, yes, I would agree that first quarter is probably the
last step-down that we have. And again, it's not really significant, and it's incorporated into our guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah, okay. Second question. Obviously, you did decide to buy securities. It looks like $30-something-billion. The
yield on the book went down a little bit. I was just wondering if you can help us understand the premium and delta,
and also just where you're buying versus runoff front book, back book at this point. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So, you're right, we did step up the investment portfolio a lot. It has to do with what I talked about earlier, in
that deployment of excess cash. We made that deployment in the fourth quarter. And while we did it in treasuries,
we swap it short. And so, that is why you see net interest margin coming down as well as the yields related to the
investment portfolio coming down.
But we also did that because we want maximum flexibility as rates -as long-term rates start to rise, we would
expect to kind of unwind that, the benefit coming through in 2022. So, that's kind of how we're positioning it in
terms of the overall investment portfolio. The vast majority of it was shorter term and with the hedging strategies.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
And just to follow up on that. So, when you say you unwind it, do you mean that you're at the right size now, or
you'd rather see it go into loans? Meaning, like how do you think about the mix of the balance sheet and earning
asset mix as you look further ahead?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. As we go forward, I would expect that our investment portfolio will be relatively flat to fourth quarter levels.
That's kind of our expectation. So, the vast majority of earning asset growth is more on the loan side than it is in
other areas.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Understood. Thank you.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Hi, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. Just on the loan growth front, I heard the color you gave in terms some of the drivers you saw in
the quarter on the commercial side, et cetera. The end of period balances came in a fair amount above average.
Is that a good indicator as we model out?
And then, separately, anything you can attribute aside from just the continued macro strengthening to the notable
strength you saw in end of period growth this quarter? I mean, it's better than a lot of your peer banks. Any calling
efforts or pricing campaign or anything else to call out on that front? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So, you're right, John, we did see some pretty significant growth in terms of end of period balances. I think
that that sets us up well with respect to 2022. One of the things it's a little bit hard, because you have LIBOR
transition, everything else happening, we don't know whether or not some of that is just people pulling forward
LIBOR a little bit into 2021.
But when we talk to our customers, I guess the thing that we see is that the underlying momentum and the
underlying sentiment is pretty strong. They're actively out building their inventories again. And all those sorts of
things, I think, is when we think about kind of our baseline growth going into 2022 why we're pretty optimistic.
But you are right, the end of period balance growth was pretty significant for us, and it wasn't because of any one
specific thing that we were doing. It was pretty broad-based across segments, across categories, and across
geographies.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. Thanks, Terry. That's helpful. And then, separately, on the payment side just higher level, given the,
clearly, intensely competitive payments backdrop, I want to see if you can kind of elaborate on U.S. Bancorp's
value proposition in the payments business as we continue to get this macro reopening or strengthening. And as
T&E spend rebounds, as you've been flagging, how would you characterize your positioning in terms of a value
proposition for customers? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, John. So, we've talked about the fact that we're trying to really weave together our banking products
together with our payment products in a comprehensive product set to help Business Banking customers basically
manage the way they're running their cash flows and their business on a day-to-day basis.

And that's our value proposition, is that combination of payments and banking in easy-to-use dashboard
information to help them run their businesses and manage their cash flows on a day-to-day basis. That's
consistent with the TravelBank acquisition that we made in the third quarter and other acquisitions, Bento and
others that we made earlier in the year.
So, that's the objective, and we'll continue to focus on that. And I would highlight the simplicity component of that,
the navigation, the simplicity of use is a real key to that on a go-forward basis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. All right. Thanks. And then one follow-up to that, Andy, just regarding that strategy, do you think you need
bolt-on deals or anything on the fintech side to continue to affect that strategy? Or do you think you have what you
need?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
I think we've made a lot of investment, both organic as well as acquisition in this capability. We're going to
continue focus on it, as Terry mentioned, but I think we have most of what we need. We just continue to refine the
capabilities and simplify the offering.

over time? And how high can that 28% go?

Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Well, again, we think that we can get additional movement on both of those charts, more banking customers using
payments capabilities and more banking using payments. We talk about the number of customers, the revenue in
that total bucket is about $1.5 billion as we think about the penetration. So, that's the base we're working with.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Understood. And then, maybe separately, can you give a little bit of color on the process for converting some of
those Business Banking customers – the Business Banking only customers in that dark blue region to also be
users of payment products? Just curious what the receptivity has been so far. And have you come across any
pushback from customers who may be using alternative payment solutions, or has the customer base been
broadly receptive?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
I would say that it's early innings, Bill. Let me start there. But I think the fundamental offering, which is a simple,
easy to use combination of banking and payments products in one simple dashboard to help them manage their
cash flows, is a receptive thought from a business standpoint. And that's really what we're focused on.
Again, many of the customers have a banking product or a payments product, but it's weaving it together for that
offering that we're focused on. And the receptivity of that has been pretty strong.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Got it. And then lastly, if I could squeeze in one final one. On the increase in expenses attributable to competition
and employee benefits, can you parse out for us how much of that was a function of greater production versus
inflationary pressures, and how much of that upward pressure you'd expect to persist?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I mean, certainly, what we ended up seeing, for example, in the capital markets business, it was stronger.
So, some of it is related to production incentives. A fair amount of it in the fourth quarter is also related to
performance-based incentives that are driven by the overall performance of the company. So, we certainly did
see that.
I would say – and maybe, Andy, you want to comment as well – certainly, there is a lot of competition for talent
that's out there. And I think the pressure is – especially when you're looking for high skilled areas in technology
and development, payments and/or digital sort of space, if you're in the hiring mode, you're paying top dollar in
order to be able to acquire that. But that competition for talent is certainly increasing and out there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
I think that's right, Terry. And sometimes it takes a little longer and sometimes it's a little bit more expensive, but
that's all been incorporated in the guidance that we offered for 2022.

And then, as a reminder, the other area that is challenging in this environment is entry level employees in the
branch side. And we get the benefit of having Union Bank combine with us this year, which I think is a positive.
And as we talked about, we're committing to frontline employees on the branch side to employment. And in this
environment, that's a positive.

David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
The last remaining question I have is related to your reserve level. And if you look back pre-pandemic, I think you
guys were targeting close to 2% in reserves. You're below that now, just below that. What is the right CECL level
of reserves for U.S. Bancorp here? And within your current reserves, on the qualitative side, how much do you
have built in for maybe Omicron or the pandemic still as part of that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. David, probably the way I would describe the last one is we still certainly believe that there's some level of
uncertainty that's out there in the economy, and so we take that into consideration when we go through the
different scenarios that we kind of model out.
Maybe kind of coming back to your first question, what is the right level? Obviously, that's going to end up based
upon economic outlook and what happens with respect to credit quality. But what I would say, and you're right, we
started the pre-pandemic or the adoption of CECL at about 2% . When you end up looking at the mix of the
portfolio and how it shifted, we're kind of right at – we're right at kind of the level that we had started with, I guess,
is the way I would describe it.

From a reserving point of view, I would just kind of keep in mind from – in terms of CECL, you have to provide for
loan growth on day one. And so, as loan portfolios start to grow across the industry, I think that dynamic of
reserve release will probably change a bit going into 2022. And again, all of that's been kind of taken into
consideration when we're thinking about our baseline forecast for 2022.

Operator: Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Hey, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. I'm going to give the question, and then I'll give a wind-up and I'll come back. But my question is, why are you
not planning for even higher positive operating leverage in 2022?
And as you know, going back in time, it was either some combination of Jerry Grundhofer, Jack Grundhofer,
Richard Davis who said, if you grow revenues faster than expenses, great things happen. And I've asked this
question before. For the last five years, you guys have had negative operating leverage, and during that time, the
stock price has barely moved as of year-end when banks are up almost half, and the market has doubled.
So, I think there's some relationship between the two. So, it's good that you're guiding for positive operating
leverage in 2022. I think that would be the first year in six years when you achieve that on a core basis. But I think
you're guiding for 7% to 9% revenue growth for this year. So, I guess that implies 6% to 8% expense growth,
which still seems to be a lot of spending. I get it. There's wage pressures.
So, it seems to me that just from the benefit of rates, you can get positive operating leverage, which means the
tech investments aren't paying off to the bottom line. I don't question whether they're paying off. You're a
conservative, trustworthy bank. But are the tech investments paying off in a way that we as investors can see
those? And why don't you have higher positive operating leverage guidance? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Well, let me start with revenue, just because I want to make sure we're all on the same page. Earlier in the
comments, we talked about the fact that we expect total revenue growth in 2022 to be in the range of 3% to 4%.
And when you think about the components of it, Mike, the net interest income is probably going to be at the higher
end or maybe even a little above that range, but fee income is probably going to be growing at the lower end or
maybe a little bit below that range.
And the primary drivers, when you think about fee income, we're still going to see in a rising rate environment
mortgage banking revenue coming down. And then, in our lease residual portfolio end of term losses will be
coming – or end of term gains will be coming down a bit, and that shows up in other income. So, I think that
there's a couple of things that will mute the growth in fee income.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
The other thing that we talked about a little bit earlier is some changes in terms of our overdraft pricing, and that's
going to have a bit of a drag in terms of deposit service charges in terms of fee income. So, the range of growth,
again, for 2022 in terms of total revenue is in that 3% to 4% range. So, maybe that kind of level-sets us with
respect to our guidance or our expectations for revenue.
On the expenses, and I'll have Andy kind of weigh in, but at least 100 basis points of positive operating leverage
is kind of what our expectation or target is. That's going to be balancing short-term and long-term expectations in
terms of investment. But we're very committed to being able to deliver at least that in 2022. So, Andy, what would
you add regarding the investment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, Mike. And just to comment on your question overall, we've been focused on making the necessary
investments in our digital capabilities and our payments business, as we've talked about that. We talked to you
about that. And our objective is to position ourselves to be successful in this environment, and I think we are.
We're in a strong position.
And I think you're going to start to see the benefits both from a revenue growth standpoint, as well as an expense
efficiency standpoint, particularly as we see the secular trends starting to increase overall. So, we made those
investments eyes wide open, very intentional, at the same time balancing some short-term expense opportunities
on the operating core basis. But I think on a go-forward basis, you're going to see positive operating leverages
because of those investments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So, just to follow-up on the technology part, when we think about your level of investments, is that still increasing?
Is it increasing at a slower rate? And my understanding was your past investments were for foundation building,
non-revenue areas. And now the investments are for revenue areas. So, if you could just think in terms of the tech
investing relative to the payoff, where are you in terms of reaping those benefits?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, Mike, we're level off. So, we're not going to continue to see increases in those investments. We did see
some increases in the past five years, but I think we're at level set area right now, number one.
Number two, we migrated from about 40/60 defense and offense to 60/40 offense right now. So, most of the
investments we're making are for revenue-generating areas, digital capabilities, payments, Business Banking, and
the other things we talked about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
And the other thing that I would just add maybe is – and this is really more kind of looking into 2023 – we don't
really see a need to increase the amount of investment, even with bringing Union Bank into the U.S. Bank fold.
And that's because, as we've talked about in the past, most of this is just a lift and shift from their systems to ours,
and so we'll be able to leverage all the investment that we've been making and bring a lot of digital capabilities to
their customer base.

Hi, Andy. Hi, Terry. Couple of questions. Credit cards, your period end was up only, I think, like 1.5% linked
quarter. You saw a bigger jump in certainly the Fed weekly data. Any color on what's going on there, why it was
slow for you guys?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
In terms of credit card revenue – credit card and debit card revenue?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
No, credit card loans, period end loans.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Oh. Yeah. What was really being still impacted, at least for us, is the payment rate is still relatively high. It did
peak in the third quarter. It came down just a little bit in the fourth quarter. So, until we start to see that
measurably improve, I think that's going to end up impacting growth rates of credit card loan balances.
Our expectation, though, Vivek, is that those payment rates do start to migrate down nicely as 2022 progresses,
and so I do think that that's going to be a bit of a tailwind for us as we think about loan growth. And it will also help
net interest margin and, obviously, net interest income.

Okay. Second question, the merchant processing decline in fees that you saw quarter-over-quarter, was that all
Omicron related coming in December, or was there something else going on there, too?

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
Yeah. From third to the fourth quarter, that's really – I mean, very, very little is really related to Omicron. We did
see a little bit of a slow-up that was kind of late in December. Really, what is happening there is that as sales
continue to pick up in travel and that sector, that tends to be a little bit of a different rate, and so it's more of a mix
thing than it is anything else, Vivek.

Operator: Your final question is from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Morning, Erica.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Hey, Erica.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I'm trying to figure out, given your outlook for positive operating leverage, why the stock has opened so weakly.
So, maybe following up on Vivek's question, I think that the Street had anticipated a much lower or lesser
seasonal step-down in payments. So, what happened with the interchange rate in the quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So, let me just kind of step back and when we think about kind of seasonality in the payments business
overall, usually from third to fourth quarter credit and debit card, depending upon the amount of investment we're
making at that particular point in time, is usually – fourth quarter is a little bit better than third quarter. But
merchant and corporate payments, typically fourth quarter is seasonally lower, and that's fundamentally kind of
what we saw both in terms of merchant and corporate.
Now, corporate ends up getting impacted by government spend, which tends to be highest in the third quarter.
You get the effect of holidays impacting travel and those sorts of things with respect to payments and that sort of
thing. That's why that tends to step down. So, I think what we ended up seeing is fairly similar to what we would
have expected in terms of the seasonality of the businesses.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
And the lower interchange rate that you mentioned on slide 12, was there anything unusual there?

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
Yeah. I mean, again, I think that that ends up getting impacted by the mix of the business. So as travel grows, the
interchange rates and the margins associated with that particular business in the merchant acquiring is at
narrower spreads. And so, as that is recovering, it ends up impacting the margins a little bit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And just to take another step back, on your net interest income guide for three rate hikes mid-single-
digit, what kind of deposit betas are you assuming? I think everybody is very well aware that your corporate trust
deposits are quite rate sensitive. But has there been a change in your mix since the 2015-2018 rate cycle? And in
general, what have you baked into your NII guide for deposit repricing, and what do you expect to actually
happen?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So, maybe at a high level, typically what we see in the early stages of rising rates is that deposit betas don't
move a lot in any of the different categories. But you are right, the corporate trust deposits tend to be a little bit
more sensitive as you get into maybe the second or third rate hike. And so, when we think about maybe that first
50 basis points, we would expect deposit betas to probably be in that 15 to 25 range, and then progressively
getting a little bit stronger as the cycle continues. And that's kind how we think about it.
Now, I would say that when we have looked at the mix of business we have had today versus, let's say, four, five
years ago, we have kind of a strong mix of consumer base. Where we have seen a lot of the growth in deposits in
2021 was actually on the consumer side of the equation as opposed to some of the other businesses. And so, the
deposit betas, my expectation, deposit betas, especially in the early stages, are probably a little bit lower than
what we have experienced in the past.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And just maybe a last one for Andy. As we think about USB in a cost inflationary environment, but in an
environment, as you said to Mike, where your investment spend is steady state, what is really the underlying –
forget just 2022, but going forward next three years, what is the underlying expense growth of this company?
And you had mentioned, I think, at a conference in 2021 that low 50s is something that you could achieve from an
efficiency standpoint. Is that something that can only be achieved with the deals that you have pending?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
So, Erika, part of achieving that is also getting back to a more normal revenue environment, which we're starting
to migrate to with rates, as we talked about in terms of our assumptions. I would expect next year, again, that
revenue growth to be well below – that expense growth to be well below revenue growth, and that positive
operating leverage, and I would expect us to achieve that on a go-forward basis.
We've made the investments to position ourselves to be successful. Those investments are going to result in
additional revenue, but also importantly, more efficiencies in the operations. So, as digital capabilities allow us to
do things more effectively and more efficiently, we've also optimized the branch network and we're going to
continue focus on that.

So, it's sort of this balance, Erika, of optimizing the current to continue invest for the future, and that's what we've
done and that's what we'll continue to do.

Operator: We do have a follow-up from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Hey, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Hi. Hey, thanks. Two quick follow-ups, one for Terry, one for Andy. Terry, could you quantify the impact of the
changes you're making, the customer friendly changes to the NSF and OD fees, and what that might be for this
year on a go-forward basis as well?
And then, Andy, just kind of wondering, with all the dynamics in Washington, people are worried about the deal
approval process for you and others getting delayed. What's the cost of that to the organization? Are you doing a
lot of prep work that gets put on hold? And if you do end up waiting longer for approval, what kind of cost is that to
the organization? And just some thoughts on that would be helpful. Thank you both.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, so let me address the overdraft. If you end up looking at our call reports, 2021, I think, our overdraft fees
were about – little less than 2% of total revenue, or $340 million. And on a fully implemented sort of basis, we
would expect that that impact of the changes we're making is probably in that $160 million to $170 million. And
we'll probably end up realizing about 75% of that next year.
And the other thing that I would just mention is that with fee waivers, from a fee income standpoint – and we've
taken both these things into consideration – fee waivers will help offset most of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay, Terry. So, I just – next year, does that mean like this year? Or...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. In 2022, we would realize about 75% of the full effect.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Yeah. Okay.

Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
And, John, we're not incurring a lot of incremental expense right now as part of the integration efforts. We have
teams working on it, but they're not, what I would call, incremental in nature. The impact of a delay would be really
delaying the efficiencies and the cost takeouts that's we projected for you, and that would be the principal impact.
