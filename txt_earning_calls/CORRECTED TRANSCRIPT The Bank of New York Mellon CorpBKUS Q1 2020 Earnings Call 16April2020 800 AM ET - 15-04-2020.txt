Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Thank you, Magda, and good morning, everyone. Before getting into our results, I want to call out the heroic
efforts of medical professionals and first responders in the US and abroad. I have doctors in my immediate family,
so I'm acutely aware of the risks and what they're dealing with. We're also grateful for the extraordinary actions
taken by central banks, regulators and governments to minimize to the extent possible, the financial fallout as we
all face this unprecedented crisis.
Now, let's shift to our financial results. I'll briefly highlight our first quarter performance and then focus on how
we're navigating the current realities, discuss what the immediate impact has been on our business and then look
at how we think about the potential impact going forward. Mike will then go through the financials in more details.
For the first quarter, we reported earnings of $944 million, and earnings per share of $1.05. That's up 12% over
the first quarter of 2019, with revenue up 5% and expenses flat as we benefited from heightened levels of market
activity and volatility, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates. All of our Investment Services business
showed solid growth.
Clearly, we have entered an unprecedented environment where things are changing quickly, and it's going to be a
very challenging time for everyone. As the – the situation has evolved quickly, but from the start our focus was on
the health and well-being of our people and the continuity of service to our clients.
We quickly transitioned the vast majority of our people to working from home, which opened up space for us to
create social distancing for the small number of essential and office staff. Fewer than 5% of our global employees
remain in the office. These essential in-office staff are primarily performing roles that cannot be done remotely.
The investments we've made in our infrastructure, operating platforms and cyber information security have clearly
benefited us, enabling us to support this broad scale remote working arrangement. All of the controls and security
oversight that govern us when working inside the office are in full effect when we're working remotely.
The response from our people has been exceptional. You couldn't ask for greater professionalism or dedication to
our clients, at a time when we're also dealing with unprecedented levels of market activity and personal
challenges.
Please note that while our people are caring for our clients, we're caring for them. We have made available to
them a host of health and well-being resources including access to telehealth services, free testing for COVID-19
in the US along with us covering all costs related to outpatient, urgent care or emergency room visits for the
evaluation and treatment-related to COVID-19. Recognizing the mental health challenges during these uncertain
times, we made available a stress management program and emotional support services and resources to help
our people cope and deal with the social isolation.
And we're supporting our colleagues who are unwell or may have been exposed by guaranteeing full pay for
absences for those who have tested positive or are self-quarantined. We're also providing paid time off to care for
immediate family members with COVID-19 or COVID-19-like symptoms. Finally, to support our people, we made

the decision that we will not do any additional layoffs during 2020. It's absolutely the right thing to do at a time
when the pandemic is creating so many personal uncertainties for our people.
Since the crisis began, we've remained fully operational and open for business. And we've been there for our
clients during this unprecedented period of market disruption. We engaged early with thousands of clients globally
to discuss their own continuity plans and work with them to ensure minimal disruption to their operational
processes and transaction settlements. We stood up client command centers for our operations and client-facing
staff to centralize, escalate and quickly resolve client inquiries. We accelerated training on our digital tools to help
clients reduce their physical and manual process footprint, minimizing their operational risk profile.
We've also taken a series of humanitarian actions in an effort to – and help those negatively affected by the virus.
That has included making philanthropic commitments to import and support organizations in regions where our
employees live and work, including organizations working in the front lines in the US, EMEA, and Mainland China
and other affected areas in Asia and India.
Announcing a two-for-one matching program for employee donations, we've also donated hundreds of video-
capable tablets to public hospitals in New York to help patients and medical staff communicate with their loved
ones. And partnering with nonprofit organizations to provide aid to first responders, healthcare, transit and other
frontline workers as well as serve some of the most vulnerable populations through the provision of critical items,
such as meals, shelter, medical equipment, educational supplies and financial support, as well as 50,000
facemasks we donated to two New York City hospitals dealing with shortages. We'll also continue to look for
opportunities to do more.
Lastly, we are focused on maintaining the strength, liquidity and lower risk profile of our balance sheet, while
using it to support our clients and markets. We have been in regular dialogue with the regulators and key market
participants to ensure we're coordinated and see how we can help bring stability to markets.
When the markets first came under pressure last month, the Federal Reserve activated a primary dealer credit
facility to provide funding to primary dealers. They achieved that through our tri-party repo services. That's
something we are uniquely positioned to do, and it's been a privilege to help.
Given our strong capital and liquidity position, we have used our balance sheet to support our clients. That means
accommodating their elevated deposits and funding about $3 billion in incremental draws on committed facilities.
In March, we also purchased more than $3 billion in assets from money market funds, including our own, to help
create liquidity for fund holders and we have continued to do so in April.
Looking ahead, we and our clients face extreme market and economic uncertainty. While it's too early to predict
the impact, we have a well-diversified and financial resilient franchise that is relatively well positioned to withstand
what's to come. In terms of the immediate impact on our business, March had extremely high levels of volatility
and market stresses. We experienced much higher client volumes than normal, and activity is up across all of our
business lines.
Let me just share a few data points that bear this out. In foreign exchange, we saw higher volumes across all
parts of our business, up approximately 50% in March and large spikes in volatility. In US dollar payments,
Treasury Service on average processed $2.5 trillion payments per day in March, peaking one-day at over $3
trillion in mid-March compared to $1.7 trillion in recent quarters.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2020
At times, Pershing saw elevated trading volumes 2.5 to 3 times normal levels. In Clearance and Collateral
Management, US government securities clearance volumes in March were up more than 20% from February
levels, driven by the heavy US Treasury issuance coupled with increased market volatility.
In Asset Servicing, during March, we experienced an increase in US accounting trade volumes of more than 50%
versus the first two months of 2020, and global security settlement volumes were up approximately 40% over the
same period. We've also experienced substantial deposit inflows.
In Asset Management, we experienced net inflows driven by cash inflows of $43 billion, and our performance fees
were up due to solid performance across our largest strategies.
As you think about our company's performance over the rest of the year, I would caution against extrapolating
these results for the full year. The full ramifications of the lower rates and the moves in the capital markets are not
yet being fully felt. The decline in our capital ratios this quarter reflects large deposit inflows, mostly due to the
flight to safety from current market conditions and Fed balance sheet expansion.
Share repurchases of $985 million were completed prior to deciding along with the other big banks to temporarily
suspend further buybacks so that we can use our significant capital and liquidity to provide maximum support to
our clients. We believe that we will have the ability in a wide range of scenarios to continue to pay our dividend
and to support our clients.
Looking ahead to the remainder of 2020, it is difficult to forecast the impact of the coronavirus on our results with
certainty because so much depends on how the health crisis evolves, its impact to the economy and issues –
actions taken by central banks and governments to support the economy. We have a lower risk fee-based
business model that positions us relatively well in an environment like this. We perform stress tests regularly as
do our regulators. In CCAR, we consistently performed well.
We have a highly diversified business model with a conservative risk profile and fees in general are skewed
towards recurring revenue streams. We should benefit from increased activity in Clearance and Collateral
Management from increased issuance of US treasuries and US tri-party collateral management, although the
latter somewhat depends in Federal Reserve Bank of New York operations. Monetary policy during times of
uncertainty tends to have a positive effect for us through lower – excuse me, through higher deposit volumes, and
we will continue to manage our expenses tightly.
All that having been said, the lower interest rate environment, which impacts us both through net interest revenue
and through money market fee waivers in Pershing, Asset Management and Corporate Trust, as well as the
market decline in certain industries being under pressure will have an impact, and Mike will cover those items in
more detail later. Still, we believe we have the capital and liquidity to withstand a multiple of scenarios, pay our
dividends and continue to support our clients.
Finally, I wanted to take a moment to convey how deeply honored I am to be CEO of this great company. While
my near-term focus is on safeguarding the well-being of our employees, supporting our clients through this period
and maintaining our balance sheet, we are looking ahead to ways to build on our solid foundation, with a strong
business model and balance sheet, to drive improved performance and capabilities across our company.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mike.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2020
Michael Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Thanks, Todd, and good morning, everyone. First, let me echo Todd's opening comments. There are an
incredible number of people in our communities who are either out there on the front lines or providing essential
services to help the rest of us and our families, not to mention all the people in government and our industry who
are working together to help the economy, help people pay their bills and ensure the smooth functioning of the
global markets, we're thankful to all of them.
With that said, let me run through the details of our results for the quarter. All comparisons will be on a year-over-
year basis unless I specify otherwise. Beginning on page 5 of the financial highlights document, in the first quarter
of 2020, we had earnings of $944 million and earnings per share of $1.05, up 4% and 12%, respectively.
Comparisons versus the fourth quarter of 2019 are impacted by the notable items we incurred last quarter,
specifically the gain on sale of the equity investment, which was partially offset by severance and litigation
expenses and net security losses.
Total revenue was $4.1 billion or up 5%. Fee revenue increased 10%, primarily driven by higher foreign exchange
and other trading revenue, higher transaction volumes and increased activity from existing clients across
Investment Services, and higher performance fees in Investment Management, which were partially offset by
equity investment losses and losses from consolidated Investment Management funds.
Net interest revenue declined 3% to $814 million year-over-year, and was flat to the fourth quarter. We increased
our provision for credit losses by $169 million in the quarter. This was driven by the macroeconomic outlook in
conjunction with the application of the new CECL accounting standard.
Our actual losses or net charge-offs were $1 million during the quarter. Expenses were essentially flat, driven by
continued investment in technology and the higher pension expenses we spoke about last quarter, partially offset
by lower staff expense and the favorable impact of a stronger US dollar. We had a solid return on tangible equity
of 20% and maintained a pre-tax margin of 30%.
In terms of shareholder capital returns, we repurchased 21.7 million shares for $985 million. The majority of the
repurchases were completed in January and were all completed ahead of the March 15 announcement by the
Financial Services Forum member banks regarding the temporary suspension of repurchases. We also paid $282
million in common stock dividends in the first quarter.
Now moving to capital and liquidity on page 6, our capital and liquidity ratios remained strong and well above
internal targets and regulatory minimums. The declines versus the prior quarter primarily reflect this quarter's very
strong deposit growth that increased the size of the balance sheet.
Common equity Tier 1 capital totaled $18.5 billion as of March 31, and our CET1 ratio was 11.4% under the
advanced approach and 11.3% under the standardized approach. Our average LCR in the first quarter was
115%, and our SLR was 5.6%. And a reminder that effective April 1, the revised rules will allow us to deduct
central bank deposits and US treasuries from the SLR denominator. Under the new rules, the SLR would have
been approximately 7.6%.
Turning to page 7, my comments on net interest revenue will highlight the sequential changes. Net interest
revenue was $814 million, flat to the fourth quarter. Despite lower rates in the quarter, the results were better than
what we had expected, driven by the elevated deposit levels, particularly in the last three weeks of March. We

also benefited from higher securities and loan balances and the widening of LIBOR to Fed fund spreads. This was
offset with the negative impact of hedging activities, which are mostly offset in trading and other revenue.
The increase in loan balances in March was primarily driven by clients drawing approximately $3 billion from their
committed credit facilities and elevated overdrafts. Higher overdrafts are normal when there is an increase in
market volatility and the overdrafts are generally well secured. The net interest margin of 101 basis points was
down 8 basis points versus the fourth quarter.
Page 8 describes how deposit balances trended over the course of the quarter. Deposit balances were close to
flat to the fourth quarter average through the first two months. And if you'll recall, we had some episodic activity
last quarter, so balances were running a little ahead of where we modeled before the increased market volatility in
March.
In March, deposits increased over $300 billion on average and $337 billion on March 31, which you can see in our
supplement. All of the businesses saw increases with the largest dollar increase in Asset Servicing. Through the
first two weeks of April, deposit balances are down from the March 31 levels but remain elevated.
Moving to page 9. Our average interest-earning assets increased to $324 billion. Approximately 41% of these
assets are held in cash or reverse repos, while 42% are in our securities portfolio and 17% are in loan portfolio. In
addition to the funded loans in the page, we also have unfunded committed lines. The details can be found in our
Annual Report and will be updated in the 10-Q. I will give you an overview of the funded loan exposures.
26% of the portfolio is related to high-quality mortgages and well secured investment credit lines provided to our
high net worth, Wealth Management and Pershing clients. To date, we have received a limited number of
forbearance requests related to the mortgage loans and are working through them with clients. The investment
credit lines performed well during the market volatility.
21% are margin loans, primarily in Pershing. These loans are well secured and have performed well during the
recent volatility as well. 23% are to financial institutions and are composed primarily of short-term trade-related
loans to investment-grade banks with tenors less than one year and secured loans to clients, including asset
managers who often borrow against marketable securities held in custody.
10% of the portfolio is in commercial real estate. Approximately 70% of the loans that are – are secured with
moderate leverage and solid loan-to-value ratios. Roughly 10% of this exposure is related to hotels and retail.
They are predominantly – these are predominantly with clients with whom we have long-standing relationships,
many over multi-generations. The remaining exposure is primarily to REITs, the majority of which are investment-
grade and are well diversified across industries. And the remaining 6% is commercial lending. These borrowers
are primarily investment grade.
Now turning to the securities portfolio. We have a high-quality liquid portfolio. Much of it is in US government
agency securities, US treasuries and sovereign debt. The portfolio increased as we deployed more cash into
securities, including the commercial paper and CDs we purchased from our affiliated and third-party money
market funds. The $4 billion of CLOs are highly rated, with 94% AAA and the remainder AA or better. 97% of the
non-agency CMBS are AAA and have solid subordination. The rest of the ratings breakdown can be found in the
supplement.
Page 10 provides an overview on expenses. On a consolidated basis, expenses of $2.7 billion were up slightly,
driven by higher technology expenses and pension costs, offset by lower incentive expenses.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2020
Now turning to page 11. Total Investment Services revenue was up 9%. Assets under custody and/or
administration increased 2% year-over-year to $35.2 trillion as higher client inflows were partially offset by lower
market values and the unfavorable impact of a strong US dollar.
Within Asset Servicing, revenue was up 8% to $1.5 billion, primarily reflecting higher volatility and higher client-
driven volumes in our foreign exchange service, higher transaction activity, higher deposits and new business
growth with existing clients.
In Pershing, revenue was up 16% to $653 million, primarily reflecting higher clearance volumes, particularly in
March. It was also driven by a one-time breakage fee related to a potential client that will not affect the run rate
and higher client assets and accounts for new business on-boarded as well as existing clients.
Issuer Services was up 6% to $419 million, with growth in both Corporate Trust and Depositary Receipts revenue.
Depositary Receipts revenue was driven by cross-border settlement activity, while Corporate Trust reflected net
new business and higher deposit volumes.
Treasury Services revenue was up 7% to $339 million, driven by higher deposit balances and higher payment
volumes. Deposit balances increased year-on-year by 22%, reflecting the environment and our investments in
new capabilities and increased focus on deposit gathering.
Clearance and Collateral Management revenue was up 9% to $300 million, reflecting elevated volumes and
balances across clearance, tri-party repo and global collateral management. Average tri-party collateral
management balances in the US and globally were up 15% and 11%, respectively.
Page 12 summarizes the key drivers that affected the year-over-year revenue comparisons for each of the
Investment Services businesses.
Now turning to page 13 for Investment Management. Total Investment Management revenue was down 4%.
Asset Management revenue was down 3% year-over-year to $620 million, primarily reflecting equity investment
losses, including seed capital as well as unfavorable change in the mix of AUMs since the first quarter of 2019,
partially offset by higher performance fees and the positive market impact.
Performance fees of $50 million were up from $31 million a year ago due to good performance in some of our
international active equity portfolios. As a reminder, our performance fees tended to be the highest in the first and
fourth quarters and lower in the second and third quarters.
We had inflows of $38 billion in the quarter, most of which was in cash. Overall, assets under management of
$1.8 trillion are down 2% year-over-year due to the unfavorable impact of a stronger US dollar. Wealth
Management revenue was down 6% year-over-year to $278 million, primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue
due to lower interest rates.
Now turning to our Other segment on page 14. Revenues were roughly flat year-over-year, while expenses
declined by $19 million, primarily due to lower staff expense.
Now finally, a few comments about the second quarter. I'll walk you through a number of variables that we're
watching closely. Having said that, I'll encourage you not to put too much emphasis on a point in time view as the
variables are changing quickly.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2020
As for net interest revenue, as I mentioned, deposit balances continue to be elevated but lower than the March 31
levels. We are expecting balances to stabilize above the February average but below the March 31 surge. We will
see the full run rate of lower interest rates on our funding costs and asset yields, including the securities portfolio.
We would expect between 25% to 30% of the securities portfolio to reprice in the second quarter.
The forward curve for LIBOR Fed fund spread shows a narrowing from today's levels. And in the portfolio, we are
monitoring prepayment speeds of the mortgage-backed securities as they may be volatile in the current
environment. So, using the forward market curves and our best estimates right now, we would expect net interest
revenue to be down sequentially between 2% to 5%. Changes to any of the variables mentioned could both
positively or negatively impact the estimate.
We also expect that the low interest rates will begin to impact money market fee waivers. This impact will be felt
more in Pershing initially but will also impact other parts of the firm. The total impact is difficult to estimate but
could be between $50 million to $75 million in the second quarter, net of lower distribution expense. Higher yields
and short-term instruments may help reduce the impact in the second quarter.
The first quarter foreign exchange and trading revenue was impacted by the significant increase in market
volatility and associated client volumes, primarily in March. Levels have subsided somewhat in April, but still
remain elevated compared to the recent historical lows in 2019. Additionally, the substantial increase in
transactional activity in March across many of the businesses, which Todd noted, was exceptional and not likely
to reoccur. We will also see the full impact of lower equity markets, although some have begun to recover.
On expenses, we're continuing to focus on driving down discretionary expense while protecting our most
important investments and continue to re-prioritize spending given the environment. We would now expect full
year expenses to be approximately flat year-on-year, including the expected 50-basis point increase in pension
expense.
Credit costs will be highly dependent on individual credits and how the economic forecast change by the time we
get to the end of the second quarter. And in terms of our tax rate, we would expect the full year 2020 effective tax
rate to be between 20% and 21%.
Now before we go to Q&A, I just want to congratulate Todd on behalf of the management team on being named
CEO. It's well-deserved and really good news for us and the company. And with that, operator, can you please
open up the lines for questions?

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Can you give us a big picture answer? Obviously, you guys are one of the chief plumbers of the financial system.
And we saw, as you pointed out, extraordinary volumes in so many different areas. Can you give us a read from
the inside how the system handled all of the surge? It appears you have handled it well, but maybe you can give
us some firsthand examples of how well the macro system worked to the surge in activity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. I'll take that, Gerard. So, it's Todd. I think it's impressive how well the system did handle the huge increases
in activity. I mean, there are a couple of glitches, but not many. And for example, in our clearing and collateral
management business, we went to 100% work from home very early on. And all of that worked quite smoothly.
And so we saw volumes increase 50% overnight, but we had the technology and the capacity to manage it.
So, I think I'm pretty impressed across the board where we saw resiliency and disaster recovery plans. That had
to change a bit too because typically a disaster recovery plan would be focused on a region, but this was
obviously global. And so the move to work from home was wherever it could be executed was executed.
So a couple of occasional glitches, constant conversations between the clearing counterparties as well as our
clients. We had many thousands of conversations to make sure that we were connected and that they knew how
they could connect with us. We – there was a lot of mobilization to the use of our portal and electronic means of
communication, which made things much simpler. So I mean – I think it was an impressive reflection of the
strength of our financial system and the infrastructure of it.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you. And then a more specific question. Obviously, CECL hit your provision for the quarter similar to other
banks, two-parts. First, what kind of economic assumptions were used to come up with that provision that you put
into the first quarter results? And then second, if you could identify where most of that was allocated, was it to you
mentioned some hotel exposure or to financial customers would be helpful as well? Thank you.

Mike, do you want to take that one?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. Yeah. Sure, Gerard. I'll take that. So I'd say, first, as you think about the reserve that we built, a very small
piece of it was due to individual either borrower downgrades or the incremental loans that we saw drawn. And
most of it was really reflective of the changing economic environment and the new accounting standard.
And as we think about the outlook that was in there, the outlook takes into account multiple scenarios and we
used that changing environment to inform what we did. And as you look at it, it was a meaningful waiting towards
a very – a prolonged recessionary scenario that doesn't fully recover until you get into 2021. So, I think that's the
way I would think about it.

Yes. Sorry, it's another earnings call that's overlapping but I'm trying to have dueling cell phone here, apologies.
First off, Todd, congratulations on getting the role of CEO. They kept us in suspense for a while, but glad to see
we got to the right prize. Quick one on deposit cost trends. So, they came in better than expected. It was probably
helped by some of the timing of deposit growth. But is there a way you could help us think about that line in 2Q,
maybe how much it was averaging, and then what you expect to continue to see as far as some relief on the
deposit cost front would be great? Thanks.

Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Okay. Mike, you want to take that one as well? And thanks...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. Yeah, sorry. Sorry about that. Yeah, so Brennan, as you think about it, so as you know, the Fed moved
pretty substantially in the latter – or the middle of March, I guess. And we adjusted our pricing there. And so you
only saw really a couple of weeks of that embedded in the first quarter averages. And so as you look at the full
run rate impact of that, it's going to be a pretty substantial increase down for the cost of interest-bearing deposits.
And so – and the beta, obviously changes, as you get close to zero. But I think you'll see a pretty significant
decline as you get down for the rest of the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay, all right. Thanks for that. And then, when we think about the servicing lines, I believe, Mike, that you talked
about how there were some strength from volumes, which aided the line, which you guys flagged during 1Q as
well in early March. And it was great to see it come through.
But it seemed as though you cautioned about that sustaining, is that because you have seen some of those
volumes already subside? And can you help us think about maybe how much of a contributing factor that was so
we could maybe calibrate for how to adjust in our forecast? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So, Mike, you want to start? And maybe I'll add a little color.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. Look, I think if you think about what we saw, as Todd mentioned in his script, Brennan, is – is the volumes
we saw in the latter part of March were exceptional. And they went from, for lack of a better way to describe it,
zero to 100 overnight.
And as we look at what we're seeing post quarter end, the volumes are still higher than they were before the
surge, but certainly off the peaks that we had in the latter part of March. And I think as you look at the go-forward
expectation, it's really hard to predict with a high degree of certainty how long they'll stay elevated and come
down, back to normal.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. Yeah. I'd add a little color. I mean, in some of the businesses like clearing and collateral management. So,
if you think about our government clearing business, that's continuing to sustain itself at very high level because
the government is issuing a lot of debt and there's a lot of trading going on around that.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2020
The collateral management business is probably a little bit off from where we saw it at the peak. But I think
secured lending will become more and more – it will continue to be important in the industry and we're likely to
see growth there. But the very high volumes, for example, that we would have seen at Pershing, the transaction
volumes are going to fall back to what we think more normalized levels, which they've begun – we've begun to do
and we've seen that in Asset Servicing to a certain extent as well.

I had a question around the prefs. Now that the rules are set in April 1, the kick-off date for the new rules, could
you give us a sense as to how you're thinking about that capital stack and what you would do with the prefs here?

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. Look, obviously, Betsy, as you know, we're in the middle of CCAR. So, we're not going to talk much about
what our capital plan looks like at this point. But as you think about where – given the increase in the balance
sheet, where we're most constrained right now is Tier 1 leverage. And I think as you think about, perhaps, that
could be a good – depending on how long we remain constrained there, that could be a good way to continue to
fund that.
I think we're going to continue to look at opportunities to either refi, perhaps if that comes back in the market and
pricing comes back to where it was just four, five, six weeks ago. So we're continuing to look at the capital stack
and we'll give you more once CCAR is done.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And then when I'm thinking about the funding mix, there's room for your funding cost to come down obviously with
not only deposits. But in looking at the long-term debt, is there some opportunity there as well in this environment
to reduce the funding costs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Mike?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A

To reduce long-term debt? Is that what you're suggesting, Betsy?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yes. Well, just looking at the yield on the long-term debt, is there room there to bring that down in addition to the
deposit cost of funds here over...?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. Well, I think – well, lower rates are going to impact our funding costs overall, right? And I think you're going
to see that come through in the second quarter. So, I think you will see that.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Mike, can you talk a little bit about – more about just helping us understand
because it's been a while now on the fee waiver side. So the $50 million to $75 million, can you just help us
understand what that means when you say net of distribution expense? Where it shows up in the income
statement? And then would there be logically, just because rates are going down, a bigger potential impact as you
move past 2Q just on the direction of rates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yes. I think I'll try to give you a little bit of the things that we're thinking about related to that. But – so first and
foremost, this is going to have an impact on government funds first, right, as you think about where yields are.
And one of the variables that makes it pretty hard to estimate right now is just where T-bill yields are. So over the
last three weeks, they've gone from negative to 20-plus basis points, back down a bit now over the last day or so.

And so that's going to be a big driver of the – when they start – when fee waivers start to kick in and the depth of
them as well. And so you have to keep that in mind.
And as you think about the funds in our Asset Management business that may get impacted by it, that may be
distributed through other parts of the company, some of those fee waivers will be offset by lower distribution
expenses in those businesses. So you'll see the fee waivers come through the fee line, and then you'll see
distribution expenses lower as they start to impact those funds.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hi, Todd.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Hey, Ken. I'll add a little bit to that. It's important to note the difference between prime and government funds. So
the yield in prime funds is – can certainly support the fees. Initially, there was avoidance of prime funds so – and
we're starting to see some investors come back to them. So that could have an impact that would neutralize some
of it. And Mike's point is there going to be enough yield in assets and government funds to generate the fees. And
the huge amount of issuance in T-bills has kind of surprised us a little bit and put a little bit of yield into that. But
that can't be certain that could come down again.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got it. And just a follow-up on the cost side, obviously, you're adjusting to try to keep costs flat in this
environment. Can you just talk about – a little bit more about what do you shift? Do you push out some investment
spend? Is it an incentive comp adjustment? What are the ins and outs of your ability to hold the line there that
you're attempting to do? Thanks guys, and best of luck Todd.

Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. We haven't seen – so first, we haven't really seen any impact on our most important investments. And as
you look at the investment portfolio and you get deeper into the list, there's always opportunity to reprioritize the
timing of some of those things. And so we're doing that.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2020
You're going to see – I'll state the obvious, but you're going to see lower travel and business development costs
that will be part of it. Although Todd said, we're not going to have any restructuring or layoffs through the rest of
the year, we're also putting a lot of discipline around new hires that we're bringing in during this environment. So, I
think it's a multitude of factors that you highlighted that help us have the confidence to get there.

Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Oh, great. Thanks. Good morning, and also congrats, Todd. Good to see you get the [indiscernible] (00:41:03)
with maybe Todd – thanks, Mike, for giving us a pretty good outlook for the activity levels coming into the second
quarter. But Todd, maybe you can give us some perspective on what you kind of see for the rest of the year?
Obviously, extremely difficult to predict, but with the government intervention and the uncertainty about the path to
recovery, how are you seeing that potentially impact some of the key business lines in activity? And also including
comments on the backstop on the Fed on prime money funds to the extent you can get much more confidence in
people investing in prime funds versus government.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. Well, first of all, as I had mentioned, we're seeing a little bit of that. So we are seeing a little bit of positive
flows into the prime funds. But if you look at activity levels, we would expect them to obviously come down from
the surge that we saw toward the end of March but probably be elevated.
And again, anything we say, there's just so much uncertainty to the environment and situation that we face. And
it's really hard for us to look out long-term until we get on the other side of the health crisis. But that being said, we
wouldn't expect to stay at the extraordinarily high levels that we saw in March, with the exception perhaps of our
Clearing and Collateral Management business just because there is going to be so much debt issuance.
But in the rest of our businesses, the transaction volumes component of Pershing business, the same thing in
Asset Servicing, we would expect that to moderate just about under any circumstances, unless we just saw
another couple of blips and more of a, what I call, a see-saw activity that could take place over the remainder of
the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And then the organic growth efforts that you're doing as well, like in deposit gathering and then collateral

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2020
Yeah. I would say if you look at the organic growth, especially around the deposits, I mean we have seen some
positives there. Obviously, there were surge deposits that are just going to be associated with this interest rate
environment in this financial environment.
But when we look out at our other businesses, we have room to gain some market share. I think we've done that
in our payments business. We had some good wins in the first quarter in our Asset Servicing business. I would
expect under this environment, people are probably going to slow down, making a whole lot of transitions. We've
got a healthy pipeline, both in our Asset Servicing and Pershing business. I'm not sure a lot of people are going to
make a whole lot of change. We are seeing some new fund complexes come on, but we're also seeing some
being deferred.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. That's helpful. And then Mike, just real quick on NII outlook into the second quarter, does that exclude FX
hedging activity?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. I mean, FX has – not FX, but the hedging activity is hard to predict because it's at a point in time at the end
of the quarter. So, we're not making an assumption either way on that at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Kleinhanzl Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thanks. Good morning. Congrats, Todd. Quick question on Pershing and kind of what you've been seeing
with all the changes going on in the industry and kind of what that means for the pipeline in that business. Has it
helped? Or is it too early to say at this point in time?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. I'll make a couple of comments, and Mike can add some color. First of all, I think it's a little early to say.
Pershing has a different model. And I think, clients are quite interested in seeing a more open architected
approach to what some of their competitors are doing. So, I think the conversations are quite healthy there. I think
the pipeline continues to be strong. They've come out with a very competitive subscription priced alternative to
meet whatever the demand of that client base is. We're continuing to invest in our advisory services business.
So I don't think it's – I don't think there's any significant impact that we're seeing from some of the consolidation
elsewhere in the business, other than it's making us a little bit more of a differentiated alternative. And I'd also – I
mentioned that Pershing did quite well through the crisis. So, it was able to keep its technology up and running

and accommodate the surge in the growth, which in some instances, as we pointed out, it was three to four times.
I don't know, Mike, do you have anything to add to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
And then I would just say, Brian, more broadly outside of just Pershing, I think we're seeing the benefits of a lot of
the investments we've been making over the last couple of years. And I think clients are seeing that as well. I
know anecdotally, we heard from a client that just what we brought on to our middle office service late last year
and saying, I'm not sure how I could have done this without you and couldn't have dealt with all of the increase in
the volatility on my own. And so I think we're seeing that sentiment really across – more broadly across the client
base.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Kleinhanzl Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then just a separate question. On those deposits that you saw come in and surge in March, they're
rolling off the balance sheet now. Are those just going more so into your own liquidity products and that's been
factored into the few waivers that you gave in the second quarter, are they just rolling off completely?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Well, why don't I take that one, and then Mike can jump in. If you think about what happened in the ecosystem. So
when there was a lot of draws, for example, under these commitments around the country, a lot of that cash had
to go somewhere. Some of it was deposited back in banks and a lot of it went into government funds.
Initially, government funds had nowhere to invest. So, a lot of that ended up in the money market funds where we
were the custodian. So we saw that big spike. That's now – a lot of that spike has normalized itself out as there
are other alternative investments for those government funds. Some of those were our own money market funds
and some of them were competitor money market funds. I think that's the biggest – the biggest most volatile
component of the cash that we saw move.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2020
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah, Mike. As I said earlier, we used a multiple – many scenarios that go into thinking about what the ultimate
reserving looks like. But it's a scenario where you don't see a meaningful uplift or doesn't fully recover until you're
into the middle of next year. So you start a recovery in the latter part of the year and you – it doesn't fully recover
until later in 2021.
As I said earlier as well, only a small portion of the reserve is related to either actual borrower downgrades or the
increase in the loan portfolio. The remainder of it is related to the changing economic environment and the way
that flows through the new accounting standard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
I guess so what I'm getting to is it's not just unique to you, it's the industry. So it seems like you're planning for
kind of a U recovery. But you have an infrastructure for a V recovery, like your you're retaining your employees,
your expenses should be kind of flat this year. I'm going to guess you're not changing tech spending, but I'm not
sure if that's correct. So help me reconcile keeping an infrastructure for a V recovery, while your underlying
premise is for a U recovery.

Do you want to start?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Okay. Yeah. Well, why don't I start? So, we did give a guidance or might give guidance that we do expect
expenses, Mike, to be lower than they otherwise would have been. We think that having the human resources
here is the right thing to do, not only for them, but also to position ourselves well to service our clients through this
kind of an environment. Trying to make any significant changes just wouldn't be particularly prudent on our part.
That being said, we are controlling other components of our cost. We want to continue to make the investments in
technology that we can. I'm sure some of that will be delayed or – and could be somewhat different prioritization.
But we're going to keep a very close eye on expenses. We think we can do a little bit better than the guidance that
we had previously given for a number of reasons. And we are talking about a U-shaped type of recovery, which
means you do need those resources to continue to support our people in this kind of an environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q

And just last follow-up then, just on the tech spending. So you expect some delay? Or like what was your tech
spending going to be? What will it be now? Or how should we think about that part?

Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Thanks for taking the question and to echo everybody's comments, congratulations to Todd. Question for
you guys with respect to just broader liquidity in the system. Clearly, there's been a tremendous amount of cash
flows coming to the sidelines, and that's both the Fed action as well as the general risk call it backdrop. How
should we think about BK's ability to absorb these deposits?
So changes to spot SLR definitely help, but there's lots of other considerations. So kind of help us to think through
the ramifications of this a little bit longer term and how the balance sheet could ultimately be in terms of size
beyond the first quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A

Okay. Mike, do you want to take that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah, I think the SLR change is helpful that's out there. But I think as you look at our constraints on the balance
sheet, it's been Tier 1 leverage based on the overall size of the balance sheet.
And I think we have been able to work through that with our clients pretty effectively, so far. And as Todd said, as
the environment normalizes a bit for the money funds and the rate environment settled down, we've seen those
real surge balances come off.
And so our expectation as things normalize more is that the balance sheet will either hold steady or come down
from where we are right now. And so we feel like we can work through that pretty effectively at – with the current
capital that we've got.

Yeah. Sure. So I'll take the first piece on the hedging benefit. So this is kind of really simple. We have interest
rate swaps in the portfolio. And the way they are valued every day creates some basis risk between OIS and
LIBOR.
And really, all we're doing is hedging that basis risk that's created from interest rate swaps. And that impact for
the quarter is based on where it all ends up on the day – at the end of – one day at the end of the quarter.
So there's really nothing else happening there. And you can kind of see the relative impact on the slide in the
presentation. And so that's a hard thing to predict in terms of where it's going to end up at the end of the quarter.
As you think about the securities portfolio, I mean, you can kind of see, where rates are right now as you think
about, both the fixed rate and the floating rate piece of the portfolio. And I think as we look at our investment
strategy going forward, we're doing whatever we can to try to get some yield out of it. And I think the reinvestment
rates are down from what you saw, obviously in the second quarter.
But just a reminder, the overall duration of the portfolio is just a couple of years, right? So we're not buying a lot of
30-year treasuries as we think about this portfolio. And I think we're doing our best to try to keep that spread up
as best as we can while within the risk appetite we're in.
