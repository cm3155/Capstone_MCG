Ronald Philip O'Hanley
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Thank you Ilene and good morning, everyone. We released second quarter results this morning. Let me begin by
saying that I'm very pleased with our continued strong financial performance. I'm proud of our team members
worldwide, who continue to put our clients first and deliver these results for our shareholders.
Turning to slide 3, I'll provide a brief update on how we are successfully navigating the COVID-19 operating
environment while also delivering earnings growth for our shareholders, providing exceptional service qualities
through improved client engagement, driving product performance, supporting the overall financial system and
safeguarding our workforce are all key priorities for us. We demonstrated success in each of these areas this
quarter and delivered strong results for our shareholders as a result.
Our clients are at the center of everything we do. You'll recall that in 2019, we took a number of actions to
improve client service quality, engagement and decision-making. These measures have led to improved client

engagement which is critically important in the current environment and its impact is evident in our results and
business performance.
Our clients are continuing to turn to State Street for operational capabilities and solutions. During the second
quarter, we effectively managed to onboard a number of new client projects across various client segments,
including a large asset manager, a significant asset owner and a national wealth manager in CRD. Indeed we see
true sustainable momentum developing our Alpha CRD platform.
All this occurred while processing 13% and 35% increases in back and middle office transactions respectively.
We were the first service provider to support the launch of the semitransparent ETF products and we see strong
demand in the market for this innovative solution. Our service quality is being recognized across the industry. For
example, we are particularly proud of our ranking in the 2020 Euromoney FX Survey, where State Street was
named the number one FX provider to asset managers for the third consecutive year, with the number one
ranking in overall customer satisfaction globally.
The strong client engagement is reflected in our product performance. Our investment servicing assets under
custody administration, which increased 5% quarter-over-quarter to $33.5 trillion, had another healthy level of new
wins, amounting to $162 billion in the second quarter. Assets yet to be installed stood at a strong $1 trillion at
quarter end. At Global Advisors, assets under management totaled $3.1 trillion and we recorded $23 billion of
total net inflows during the second quarter. Our SPDR range of ETFs recorded its best quarter of inflows since the
fourth quarter of 2017, while SPDR GLD, the Gold ETF had its strongest ever level of inflows at $12 billion.
Further, we are competing and winning in key strategic areas of focus for us. Our recently expanded and re-
benchmarked range of low cost ETFs also recorded its highest quarterly level of inflows at an $11 billion. Our
sector SPDRs made strong market share gains with almost half of [ph] sec (00:05:26) industry flows going into
the product during the second quarter. And we remain at flight-to-quality for cash management and liquidity
solutions across a suite of product options.
We continue to play a critical role in supporting the financial system. The operating environment remains
uncertain as the pandemic continues to impact many parts of the world. While we have seen a partial recovery in
some areas, many economic indicators continue to point negatively and unemployment remains high, reflecting
the real human cost of this health crisis. State Street continues to support the broader economy and markets and
is actively assisting client access to various Federal Reserve programs that support the flow of liquidity and credit.
Currently, State Street is involved in five Federal Reserve programs, either directly such as with the Money
Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, or as a program's custodian and administrative such as the Main Street
Lending Facility. Lastly, developing high performing organization and planning ahead for our global workforce also
continues to be a priority. We continue to have about 90% of our employees working from home, as we optimize
work-from-home model while leveraging technology to enable better collaboration and more effective ways to
serve our clients.
Last quarter, we took measures to protect our employees and announced that through the end of the year, we
suspended any workforce reductions other than for performance or conduct reasons in light of the COVID-19
crisis. Now we are going further for our employees by increasing their opportunities for mobility by launching an
internal talent marketplace. By supporting our employees as they take on new roles and learn new skills, the
marketplace will better develop and redeploy our internal talent, to meet our evolving business needs and the
growing demands of clients and stakeholders.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
Turning to slide 4, and our second quarter and first half performance highlights. I am pleased by our continued
strong performance and the progress we are making toward achieving our medium term financial goals. Relative
to the prior year period, total revenue increased 2% and fee revenue increased 5%. Second quarter EPS was
$1.86, up 31% year-over-year and ROE was 12.1%. I am pleased to report that our second quarter pre-tax
margin improved by over 2 percentage points year-over-year to 27%, our first half pre-tax margin increased by 3
percentage points.
The front-to-back Alpha platform strategy provides an attractive value proposition for our clients. Our second
quarter performance was helped by the strong revenue performance of Charles River Development, where we
had key business wins and renewals. The Alpha CRD pipeline continues to develop well with a good mix of deal
sizes, functionalities and scope. We expect to be announcing new major wins between now and year-end.
Turning to expenses, the pandemic created an immediate challenge to our expense reduction planning, relative to
our original expectations at the start of the year. To help offset this impact, we took immediate action by
implementing a hiring freeze, launching the talent marketplace I just referenced, and reassessing all discretionary
expenses. I'm pleased to report that through our continued expense management efforts, further IT optimization
and operational productivity measures, we reduced total expenses by 3% in the second quarter, relative to the
year ago period. While we continue to invest in our business, first half 2020 expenses are now down 2%, net of
those investments relative to the year ago period.
For us, productivity management is a way of life as we continue to build on the strong culture of expense
management we successfully established during 2019, when we undertook significant actions to improve our
operational efficiency and reduced expenses through a comprehensive firm-wide expense savings program. We
cannot control the economic environment, but we can control our expenses. Despite the challenges that COVID-
19 pandemic has created, we remain highly focused on driving productivity improvements and automation
benefits, as we strengthen our operating model and enhance service quality even during this challenging period.
Turning to our balance sheet and capital, we are pleased with our 2020 CCAR results and the inaugural
determination of our preliminary stress capital buffer at the minimum 2.5% level. The COVID-19 pandemic has
provided an unprecedented real-time stress test and our strong capital position has enabled us to operate
effectively, help stabilize the financial markets, and support our clients, employees and communities.
While the environment remains uncertain, State Street's performance under the Federal Reserve severely
adverse scenario is another reminder of our business model's resiliency and our capital stability. We recently
announced our intention to continue our quarterly common stock dividend of $0.52 per share in the third quarter.
Consistent with the Federal Reserve instructions to all large banks, we will be suspending share repurchases for
the third quarter. As we look ahead, given our strong capital position we will consider a full range of capital
actions, including the resumption of share repurchases in upcoming quarters. We will of course take into account
economic conditions, safety and soundness, the Federal Reserve supplemental CCAR scenarios and review
process, our capital levels and any interim regulatory limitations.
To conclude, I'm very pleased with this quarter's results, which demonstrates continuing revenue improvement
even during difficult times, as well as further evidence of our ongoing ability to tightly control expenses while
continuing to safeguard our employees and serve our clients.
And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
Eric W. Aboaf
Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Thank you Ron and good morning everyone. Let me begin my review of the second quarter by summarizing our
year-over-year results on the left panel of slide 5. EPS is up 31%, revenue is up 2%, expense is down 3%, with
expanding margins and healthy ROEs. And I think it is useful to point out that while we continue to operate in an
extraordinary environment with the COVID pandemic, our results this quarter show strong underlying momentum
and durability in our State Street operating model.
Our bellwether servicing fees are up year-on-year. Our prior investments in our global FX and CRD franchises
have yielded strong results. We've been able to carry reserve build and throughout all of this, we have continued
to drive expenses lower and lower. And so our pre-tax margin is up 2.3 points year-on-year and our ROE is up 2
points.
Turning to slide 6, period end AUC/A levels increased 2% year-on-year, and 5% quarter-on-quarter. The year-on-
year move was driven by higher period end market levels and client flows, partially offset by previously
announced client transition that had a de minimis effect on revenue during the quarter. Quarter-on-quarter the
AUC/A increase, which is partially reported on a lag, was mainly due to higher period end equity market levels.
AUM levels increased 5% year-on-year and 14% quarter-on-quarter to $3.1 trillion driven largely by higher period
end market levels and net inflows. Amidst continuing uncertain economic conditions, Global Advisors saw net
inflows of $23 billion, driven by cash and ETF flows, partially offset by institutional outflows. I highlight that our US
SPDR ETF saw another strong quarter with $24 billion of inflows which was well diversified once again. As Ron
mentioned, our low cost SPDR portfolio ETF saw their largest quarterly inflow yet and continue to gain share. Our
commodity ETF and sector ETF saw strong inflows too.
Moving to slide 7, servicing fees were up 2% year-on-year, reflecting higher client activity and net new business,
only partially offset by some pricing headwinds, which continue to moderate. Servicing fees were down 1%
quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower average market levels, partially offset by higher client activity. Despite the
recovery in equity markets since the first quarter, average domestic and international equity markets were still
down sequentially, impacting servicing fees. However, client activity remained elevated though down from March
levels, as market volatility persisted throughout the quarter.
Amidst the ongoing pandemic, we have maintained business continuity and continue to provide clients with the
benefits of our scale and diverse capabilities. On the bottom right of the panel of this page, we've included again
some sales performance indicators that underline this dynamic. As you can see, AUC/A wins totaled $162 billion
in Q2 with several deals coming through.
Assets to be installed as of period end 2Q were strong at $1 trillion. We continue to have a strong pipeline of front
to back Alpha deals and expect multiple Alpha announcements in the second half of the year.
Turning to slide 8, let me discuss the other important revenue lines. Beginning with management fees, Q2
revenues decreased 4% year-over-year, driven by institutional product outflows and mix, partially offset by strong
net inflows from both ETF and cash products.
With the second quarter now complete and have better sense of the fuller great picture, we now anticipate that
the likely impact of money market fee waivers, net of distribution expense, will be at the low end of our previously
announced range, or just $10 million to $15 million for the full-year.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
As I mentioned in earlier my remarks, FX trading services saw another strong quarter with revenues up 26% year-
on-year, but down 25% quarter-on-quarter as the business again elevated volumes and increased client demand,
but down from the record level seen in Q1.
The FX rating franchises continue to see market share gains and increased client engagement. As Ron
mentioned, we saw strong results across the recently released 2020 Euromoney Survey, securing the number
one spot in global customer satisfaction in service as well as the number one spot for all products and for
electronic trading for higher asset manager clients.
Securities finance revenue decreased 27% year-on-year as agency lending demand for assets widens and shift
towards lower spread fixed income assets and as ongoing hedge fund deleveraging in falling markets drove down
and hence cut the demand. Securities finance revenue was flat quarter-on-quarter.
Finally, software and processing fees increased 46% year-on-year and more than doubled quarter-on-quarter,
driven by significant revenue adds of CRD, which I'll talk more about shortly, and past positive outcomes in our
market sensitive activity, which include certain currency translation impacts and marks on employee long-term
internal plans. These other items were positive this quarter in contrast to first quarter when they were notably
negative.
Moving to slide 9, CRD generated standalone revenue of $145 million, which was up 59% year-on-year and 45%
quarter-on-quarter, driven by a large wealth implementation and several large asset manager renewals.
We've always talked about the lumpiness inherent in ASC 606 revenue recognition standards. So while we are
extremely pleased with these results, remind you not to read across any one quarter.
Moving to the right-hand side of the page, we were quite pleased to see the momentum in CRD this quarter
overall and the progress we have made to expand the CRD presence in the wealth segment in particular, which
you may recall was one of our key synergy commitments at the time of acquisition. Wealth now represents
approximately 20% of CRD revenue and represents another area of growth for us.
Turning to slide 10, NII decreased 9% year-on-year and 16% quarter-on-quarter. Excluding the impact
[indiscernible] (00:18:38) market benefits of $20 million in first quarter, NII was down 13% quarter-on-quarter. The
sequential decline in NII was primarily driven by the full quarter impact of lower market rate, including the impact
of Central Bank intervention with more USD liquidity, driving lower than expected sponsor repo volumes.
We continue to support clients' use of the Federal Reserve Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility. As a
result, this quarter, MMLF balances averaged $19 billion and finished the quarter at $11 billion. You will see on
the left-hand side of the slide that this quarter we are also showing our NIM excluding the impact of the MMLF.
While MMLF had a positive impact on NII this quarter, its impact on our NIM was a negative 5 basis points.
Average assets increased 13% quarter-on-quarter and average deposits increased 9% quarter-on-quarter.
However, period end deposits decreased 22% or $57 billion quarter-on-quarter as a portion of the uptick in the
deposits we saw at the height of the pandemic receded in the last few months.
Given the Fed's expansion of the money supply however, we do expect a good portion of the current deposits to
stay with us, which we will reinvest in a mix of both loans and securities.

Moving to slide 11, we've again included some color on the loan portfolio as well as the company's allowance for
credit losses. On the top panels of this page you can see updated detail around our high quality loan book and its
characteristics. Compared to first quarter, average loans decreased 4% while period end loans decreased 17%,
primarily driven by a reduction in client overdraft levels we saw during March. Overall, the loan book remains
healthy with our largest lending category, capital cost enhancing to private equity funds seeing no change in
borrowing pattern, but with continued strong demand for new facilities.
Moving to the bottom panel, the allowance for credit losses increased to $163 million, primarily due to $52 million
in provisions for credit losses driven by changing economic conditions and ratings migrations, offset by $14 million
in net charge-offs. You will note, we took advantage of the rally in the leveraged loan markets to selectively de-
risk our leveraged loan portfolio and exited certain positions, which effectively cost us $6 million given the
necessary reserve build. So, a good trade.
On slide 12, we have again provided a view of expenses this quarter ex-notables so that the underlying trends are
readily visible. Our 2Q 2020 expenses were down 3% year-on-year and down 1% quarter-on-quarter, excluding
both notable items and seasonal expenses with favorable trends across most expense categories.
As we said last quarter, amidst the ongoing pandemic, we continue to execute on many of the investments and
optimization savings initiatives detailed earlier in the year. And while we suspended workforce reductions through
year-end, other than for performance or conduct reasons in light of the COVID crisis, we have found additional
expense opportunities to act upon.
We continue to make progress on lowering compensation benefits costs, occupancy costs, and Other costs, while
IT costs are lumpy but on track.
We are particularly pleased that our results reflected continued and sustainable expense reduction
notwithstanding the extraordinary market conditions, while also delivering top-line revenue growth.
Moving to slide 13, on the right you can see the evolution of CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. We are thus
navigating this challenging environment with strong capital levels. In 2Q, our standardized CET1 ratio increased
1.6 percentage points quarter-on-quarter to 12.3%, driven by solid retained earnings and a reduction in RWAs as
market volatility receded. The Tier 1 leverage ratio was essentially flat at 6.1% due to higher capital levels offset
by higher deposits.
We were also pleased with our 2020 CCAR results. Our capital resilience under the Fed stress scenarios
continues to demonstrate our low risk profile. And this year we received a preliminary stress capital buffer
requirement of 2.5%, which would have been much lower if it were not floored at 2.5%.
As you know, the Fed has asked for large banks to suspend share buybacks in the third quarter. However, we
expect to continue to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.52 per share.
And finally, as Ron noted, the firm's capital position remains strong amid the uncertainty created in the COVID-19
pandemic. Accordingly, we'll consider a full range of capital actions including the resumption of share repurchases
in upcoming quarters, but will do so considering economic conditions, safety and soundness, the supplemental
CCAR scenarios and review process, our capital level, and any interim regulatory limitations.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
Turning to slide 14, we have again provided a summary of our 2Q results. As we mentioned earlier, we are
pleased with the results and believe they are a reflection of the durability and resiliency of State Street's business
model as well as our focus on delivering on our strategy of both growth and productivity.
Throughout this crisis, we have differentiated ourselves by proactively reaching out and assisting clients through
these difficult times. We believe that our resiliency during this extraordinary period and our constant attention to
service quality has created goodwill with our clients and positioned us for share gains over the medium- to long-
term.
Last quarter, I outlined our full-year financial outlook under a certain set of assumptions, noting that there was a
range of possibilities as a result of the potential length of the COVID pandemic and the associated economic
impact. I would like to update those expectations with our current thinking, again noting there remain a broad
range of possible outcomes.
We now expect global central banks will keep short rates at currents levels for the remainder of the year and long
end rates will stay at a June 30 spot rate through year-end.
We also now assume that average global equity market levels for the remainder of 2020 will be flat to current
levels. As a result of our clients' engagement, moderating pricing pressure, and CRD and also our front-to-back
wins, we now expect that full-year fee revenue will no longer be down 1% to 2% year-on-year for the full year
2020, but instead will be up approximately 1.5% to 2% with servicing fees expected to show a year-over-year
improvement relative to 2019.
Regarding NII, given the impact of continued lower long end rates on the investment portfolio and Central Bank
intervention with more USD liquidity driving down the expected repo volumes, we now expect NII to be down
approximately 9% to 11% on a sequential quarter basis and expect the fourth quarter to be relatively in line with
the coming third quarter.
Turning to expenses, we remain laser-focused on driving sustainable productivity improvements and achieving
automation benefit. We expect that full-year expenses will now be down at the better end of our previous guide of
down 1% to 2% year-on-year, excluding notable items, as we continue to find ways to control and drive down
expenses.
In regards to our provision for credit losses, we continue to see a range of outcomes based on evolving economic
conditions and any ratings migrations.
On taxes, we expect our tax rate for the full year to be closer to the lower end of our 17% to 19% range.
And with that let me hand the call back to Ron.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from
Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great, thanks, good morning folks. Thanks for taking my questions. Eric, if you could just unpack a little bit the NII
guide just in terms of what you are seeing for client deposit levels moving into 3Q and to what extent your
guidance for 3Q and 4Q includes, more reinvestment or more shift of deposits into longer term securities. I'm
sorry, and I also want one more on that, if the retail financing business in terms of the impact, it looks like that was
much lighter in the second quarter through – just your thoughts on that for second half as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Eric, you are muted.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Brian, it's Eric. Thanks for the question. We're clearly navigating through some challenging time for the – with the
interest rate environment and obviously trying to do our best to navigate through.
When you think about NII guide, there is clearly the continued downtick in long-term rates which is affecting the
investment portfolio, and will continue to some extent in the coming quarters after that. And then there is some
lower volume sequentially and overdraft and then the MMLF balances that are also contributing to that, to the
second quarter to third quarter decline. I think once we get to that level, part of what happens is that you've got
offsetting factors. You've got on one hand the lower long end rates, which put – which tends to track through the
investment portfolio for another couple of quarters, which creates a downdraft. And those I think can be offset by
the growth in the investment portfolio and lending base, which is really supported by the higher levels of deposits
that we're operating at.
Now it's hard to tell exactly what the deposit levels are going to be, but I think if you stare at the data that we've
shown here – we used to run at $155 billion to $160 billion of deposits. First quarter average was solidly at $180
billion, second quarter was solidly at $197 billion. We think we are going to land somewhere between those two
points, which means that off of the original base of call it $160 billion of deposits, there is an ability to expand the
investment portfolio, put on duration carefully and selectively invest in some high-quality position to maintain our
HQLA. And we think that together should create some stability on NII in the coming quarters.
The sponsored repo program, as you mentioned, did create a downdraft from 1Q to 2Q. And what we're seeing
there is that the overnight repo rates are less attractive than they've been relative to one month treasury rates,
and so that creates reduction in volumes. If that were to persist, then we're not going to get a lift there and we're
not going to get the volumes we'd like to see. On the other hand, if that normalizes back, there could be some
upside in the coming quarters, but more – more, time will tell before we can incorporate that into our forecast.

Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay, great. That's super helpful. And then maybe on CRD, the – was a very strong quarter, very encouraging on
the wealth management wins. Maybe just a two-part question. Eric, on the revenue trajectory, obviously it's lumpy
like you said. Maybe if you can just try to characterize what you thought was one-time licensing fee revenue within
the second quarter. And then maybe Ron, if you want to talk a little bit about that wealth strategy? Sounds very
encouraging in terms of the win that you've announced and potential new wins down the road. And maybe just in
terms of sizing that space for you, what you're doing there on the wealth side that's different than the institutional
asset manager side at CRD?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah, Brian, why don't I start and then I'll turn it over to Eric. So I'll start on the latter part of your question there.
As we mentioned when we acquired Charles River that in addition to its core institutional client segment, it has
developed a fair amount of technology applicable to the wealth segment, particularly the larger wealth manager
segment, large private wealth managers, wirehouses et cetera. And that is – we've continued that R&D and also
leveraged our own client relationships to be able to help propel that growth. And that's what you are seeing
playing through. We see it as a solid and additional form of growth on top of the core institutional business. Right
now I think it's about 20% of the business, up significantly from when we acquired it and we would expect it to be
growing probably a little bit more than the – at a slightly higher level than the institutional business. And the good
news about this is that it shares the same technology and operating platform – I mean, there are certain sub-
applications that are different, but we can do this at scale easily.
And the way I would say you should think about the lumpiness – I mean, Eric will take you through the – how the
accounting actually works, but when you start to see kind of a positive lumpiness like this – I mean, it's essentially
a client being installed and it's at the point then that we can start to recognize revenue, and following that would
be ongoing recurring fee. So that's how you should interpret the lumpiness. It is one-time as it relates to that
client, but it's certainly not one-time as we continue to grow, you'll see that same kind of lumpiness.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Brian, let me add some texture and even some numbers to that so that you can get a better sense of the
underlying revenues here. And we're quite pleased with the growth trajectory. We're quite pleased with the
pipeline, with the kind of contracted but not yet installed level. We track the number of different metrics here to
give us confidence in the developing growth.
The revenues really come, I'll call it, broadly into two buckets. There is SaaS revenues and Professional Services,
and SaaS revenues are pretty straightforward. You win a client, it's a five-year contract and the revenue
recognition is that the revenue is ratably applied over those five years, very straightforward. And in fact we want to
be in the business of growing SaaS revenues over time and Professional Services because those create a very
regular and recurring set of revenues. The second part of the revenues come from on-premise installations. And
we have a number of clients who had on-premise installations and even some who continue to prefer them. And
in those cases, the revenue recognition comes in two parts. You have an upfront piece, which could be in the
range of around 60% of the contract and then you have the balance, call it, 40% in the example I've given you,
which could be ratably over the contract length if that were say a four or five-year contract. And so you get a piece
and then you get a trail behind that. So, those are the two big pieces.

When we look at the revenue number that we showed you on page 9, you go back – what we want to be doing,
we want to be growing both pieces to be honest and in particular the regular – the first one, the very recurring
revenue base. If you go back on page 9 and you look at the data we shown around revenues, back in the second
quarter of 2019 we had $91 million of revenues, about 65% of that was in SaaS and professional fees. And so it
gives you a sense for the, kind of the relative amount. If you go [indiscernible] (00:36:34) quarter of this year,
those recurring SaaS and professional fee revenues were just over $80 million, but we see nice growth year-on-
year, and in fact it's happened consistently over the five quarters. And then the balance of the $145 million is been
more in the on-premise kind of revenue installations where you get a good-sized piece upfront, but then the
recurring piece in the future. And I think if you step back with that kind of revenue recognition where we are
focused on growing client and client engagement – and some clients are delighted to be on the SaaS platform
and we've seen consistent growth there, so that gives us some confidence in the, kind of the completely recurring
base and then you have the more on-prem kind of revenues, which start off with a piece, they then have a trail, all
right, and then when the contract ends you get another piece that's lumpy and then a trail after that. And that's
just the nature of the beast of how the revenue recognition works. All-in, we are quite pleased with this revenue
trajectory, the backlog, the contracted but not yet installed, and the sales performance. And so while you see
some lumpiness, we are seeing good underlying metrics as well.

I wanted to understand a little bit on the expense side. I know you called out improvement there in part from
things like market data, which is really impressive given that market data cost for most participants is moving
higher and higher every quarter. So just wanted to get a little bit of color on that and on the subcustody savings
and to what degree is there more legs there in that specific line item in your expenses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Betsy, it's Eric. Both of those are sizable expense categories. They both are part of the transaction processing line
item that we report. And what we found is that we need to just actively manage those. Subcustody is something
that we need provided to us and so we've worked with some of the largest banks as well as some of the country
banks to find the best mix of service at a declining cost level. And our view is that that's something we need to
keep doing year after year and we've been able to deliver I think some good savings this year and our expectation
is to continue that trajectory.

Market data is a little more complicated. To your point is that there is a plethora of market data ingestion that's
possible. And what we've found is that we need to both manage the ingestion pipes because if we secure market
data in too many different pipes then we end up buying more than we need. We also need to find vendors, and
over the last couple quarters we've started to really work more closely with several of our vendors around who
gives us the best cost and pricing kind of quality levels. And that's also been factored in.
And then there's a third piece to be honest on market data which I find helpful from a client standpoint to be
honest which is, some of our market data costs are borne by us which we want to drive down but with the right
quality, and others are market data costs are sometimes borne with our buyer clients. And we're, in many cases,
working with our vendors – again, both pools of market data to try to secure the best results for them as well. So,
lots of activity there. What I would tell you is that some of what you see on that transaction processing line is the
result of some intense focus on those areas and it's actually a bit of an example of what we're doing in other
areas. We talked about starting to drive our technology cost down, and so we're doing similar work on hardware
costs and hardware vendors, working with them in a more active way. We are doing that in software and
maintenance contracts on the technology side. And so, it's really become an expanding, I'll call it expertise, but
sort of partnerships and approaches that we've taken I think to good effect, but to be honest, one that we need to
repeat year after year to get the benefits that we like to help drive our expanding margins.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And so you've got some more legs there is the nut of that answer. And I appreciate all the color. It's
interesting, especially with the client side of it. The follow up I have for you, Eric, is regarding the net interest
income, net interest margin outlook. And I know you have a 9% to 11% down Q2 and 3Q and then stabilization
into 4Q. Maybe you could give us some color on the assumptions around the 4Q stabilization, what has to happen
for that to come through?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah, the 4Q stabilization is really driven by, I think the economic – kind of the interest rate environment first and
foremost. So we're assuming short-end rates stay more or less where they are and we're assuming long-end
rates stay more or less where they are, [ph] the forward though (00:42:29) we've had some expansion and
increase and I think we've gone a little gun-shy about always planning for those, and so we feel like we should
plan at the current levels. So that's the first part of the assumption base. I think the second part of the assumption
base is that there is some normalization in deposits, but as I've said I think we've got a nice chunk there that we
can begin to think of as – or that we are confident, are stickier, and it depends on the speed of our reinvestment in
the investment portfolio into some asset classes that we're comfortable with, and I think that will factor in as well.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
Hi, thanks. Quick follow-up question on the expense side, I heard your overall comments, so that's what matters
most, but within this quarter's 3% dropdown, 40% of the reduction expenses was lower marketing and travel. I'm
assuming that's the product of the environment. So how much of that is sustainable or works its way back in?
Again, I appreciate that's probably part of your overall expense comment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yes, Glenn that's fair because as you know we're trying to find sustainable expense reductions this year and then
into next year. And if we just firmed down and they pop back up, it doesn't count, neither for our shareholders, nor
for us. There are some tailwinds of travel expenses and even some medical benefit claims are lighter in the
expense trends, but remember there is also some headwinds that we would have – or actions and areas where
we would have driven expenses down that we weren't able to. And so, as – the biggest simple example is the
pause on layoffs because of the pandemic. Now that would have been worth at least half a point of expense
reduction if not a little more for every quarter this year and on a full year basis. And I think what we're going to
have to do next year is, go back to what we've been doing, driving down all of our costs, our compensation and
benefit cost, where we'll be able to now action that, and continue to drive down third-party spend cost as well.
And so I think the trend will line up. There is just going to be some ins and outs or headwinds and tailwinds at any
point, but we see a path to continue doing what we are doing, which is to drive expenses lower and lower year
after year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q

Okay, I appreciate that. And then during the quarter you announced a venture with FNZ on servicing and the

seem to have a really strong operation in Europe, but you bring to the table what they bring to the table, that'll be
great. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah, Glenn, it's Ron. So, FNZ has a very strong operating platform. Its target market is a – certainly in the US
would be the smaller and/or a lower end in terms of size of market segment than we do in Charles River and
CRD. So it's quite complementary to what we do. We would be their custodian and administrator as they move
into that space. So we view it as a way to expand into a – even further into wealth as a segment that we wouldn't
naturally have leading capabilities in, number one. Number two, they have got some really interesting technology
that we want to continue to figure out – we can use elsewhere. So it's a way of getting some technology
leadership as well as a revenue stream at a relatively low cost for us.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I'd like to follow up on the Charles River commentary and
the frontend fees versus that trail – and the trail dynamic. It sounds like that's a little less than half of this quarter's
revenue. So wanted to confirm that's the case. And then is the onboarding, the installed frontend, is that a multiple
quarter dynamic or is that a single dynamic? How does the trailer in those arrangements compare to the upfront?
So how should we think about the continuing revenue dynamic? And then how long are those contracts and
what's the typical retention rate? I just would love to get a better dimension for the cadence of those revenues, if
you can provide some of that. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Brennan, its Eric. It's fair to get into the detail, because the details do matter. But as we do that, let me remind
you, there is a range of details, and so let me try to answer the question that we can certainly follow up with you
and other investors that are curious. But this is a bit of the bankers working in a software space, which just
operates in a different cadence with ASC 606.
First, the recurring revenues, the SaaS kind of implementations are pretty straightforward, and I think I gave the
numbers there and I think you've got the right mix. The mix in each of these quarters though has been much
more, kind of SaaS, Professional Services, the completely – I'll call it, completely stable revenues, and those have
been building nicely and I think we are quite pleased with that trajectory.
On the lumpier part of the revenue, which is the on-premise installations, the answer is, there is a range of
different situations which have to do with different contract lengths. And so let me just give you a sense. Contract
lengths can range from, call it three years to eight years, right, and for those kinds of ranges, then you tend to get
– on three-year contracts, you might get 70% upfront and then the other 30% over the rest of the three years and
it comes in kind of year by year by year or quarter by quarter by quarter, the effect, or for something like a seven-
or eight-year contract you'll tend to get about 50% in the first year and then the other 50% in the seven or eight
years ratably.
And so there is a range, but I think it's – I don't know, it's the account slated to measure the revenues in a
reasonable way and you'll have to talk with them if you like it or not. I can't really opine there. But that's the range.
The upfront piece comes in a particular quarter. And why is that? Because that's when the system literally goes
live and is beginning to serve clients, so it becomes in-serviced. And it's the quarters after that through the length
of the contract that you ratably see the rest of the revenues. What I do want to remind folks though us that once
we have a client – the client retentions in our business are very, very high.
We retain most of our clients. And so on a three-year contract, the description that I just gave of 70% plus a 30%
over the trail, three years later gets repeated, right. Same for a five-year contract five years out. And so in a way,
we're a little hesitant when people casually say, well that's one-time. It's not really one-time, right, it's – there is a
good piece upfront, there is good piece ratably that we've secured, and then there is almost always the extension
which brings us the same thing again. It's just that it's a little lumpier than we'd all like. So maybe I'll pause there,
but happy to talk more at the right time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Well, one more piece of my question I think that you might have forgotten, Eric, is the retention rate. What's the
historical retention rate on those three-year [indiscernible] (00:52:07)?

I mean, we can – I think it's very high. Why don't we do a little follow up and get that out to you in a Reg FD.

Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
But it's – they were part of our diligence of retention rates. Before I put a precise number, let me come back, but
it's very, very high.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
It's something that gives us a lot of confidence, because remember, once you have an on-premise installation –
like you've invested a lot internally on the client side to integrate it with your estate, with your other systems and
subsystems. And so there is a willingness and there is an ability, which together result in very strong, very high
renewal rates.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. Brennan, it's Ron. Maybe just to reinforce why that is, I mean typically what goes on in these conversions
is, there is a pretty big and significant operating model change that goes on at the asset manager or the wealth
manager. So, typically a new client is not that we're displacing somebody like Aladdin. Typically it's a client that's
got a bunch of bespoke and scattered technology and they are moving to a comprehensive kind of system like
this. So that's why you get very, very high retention rates, because frankly the switching costs on the client side
are pretty high.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah, thank you for that. I appreciate all that color, Ron and Eric. And then following up on – you gave some great
color on expenses, and I understand it's really hard to be too granular, Eric, to your point in the unusual operating
environment that we're in, but [ph] I'd give something in a (00:54:01) shot anyway. Have you reviewed your real
estate footprint? Boston is a fairly expensive city and when you look at your website, it seems like you have three
different offices in the city. It's not really the optimal footprint. Based upon the experience that we have been
seeing here, early read on the pandemic and the shutdown. Have you rethought the potential for remote or
distributed workplace arrangements? How much do you think you can compress your occupancy expense over
the next few years on the back of some of that?

Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Brennan, it's Eric. Let me start on that to give you a little bit of, kind of near-end views and Ron may play in as
well. And in fact I might ask your CFO the same question when I see him next because I think every CFO out
there, not just bank CFO's is wrestling with this question. You know here at State Street, we have occupancy
expense of about 435 million bucks, and we had already planned to drive it down this year by about 5%, so taking
a chunk out of that, and part of that is continued rationalization of our high cost location footprint and taking
advantage at the same time of some of the productivity, right, take that from the head count management that we
have done around the world as well. I think in the very near term a couple of things happened in real estate, one
is, we just don't add any real estate. And Ron and I put an immediate halt as soon as this pandemic happened.
And let me tell you, there is no – that halt is perpetual practically.
It then – it does have a little bit of an effect where we can't easily sub-let. So now what we are doing is going back
to every lease that we have and literally going through and asking the question, when does it roll over. The
question that it really wrestles through is, what kind of occupancy rate can you operate at? And if you know, most
of us have operated at the, call it 85% to 95% occupancy rate. And I think what this pandemic has demonstrated
is that the tools and the capabilities through technology and the methods that we have in our company is, we can
drive occupancy rates up to – we are originally planning to 130%, 140% just by thinking about people's historic
approaches to being in the office are not. And I think that is kind of what gives us the view that if we originally
thought we could get to a 120% occupancy rate, and now with the pandemic we are confident we could get to
150%, that's how you start to get some real leverage on the occupancy cost.
I think the one thing that gets in the way of that – and I'm taking a very kind of financial – and we have to think
about our people, our teams, our clients, and all the interactions, and all that they do, is we also need to be
respectful of some of the social distancing requirements in the immediate term. And so I think what we have is,
we have a period right now where work-from-home is 90% let's say. With social distancing, we can bring a certain
number in. At some point there is a vaccine, so the social distancing may not be at the same level as it is now.
And we have a whole group of employees who have learned to operate incredibly effectively, work-from-home,
some of whom prefer to be home. And so I think there's a lot to do here.
This is I guess the summary. I tell you, we are already down occupancy cost and I think the question that we'll
come back to in the coming quarters and in the coming year is, how much more? It is not that they can't – that
they won't come down. They will come down. I think it's a question of scale off of that base of expense that I
circled it from.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah, Brennan, it's Rob. What I would add to that is, in a fairly short period of time we have gone through three
kind of phases of work. Work-from-home was about a one-week event for us, and we got 90% of the people out of
the buildings and into a home environment. We started about three weeks after that planning the return to office,
which, in Asia-Pacific as you can imagine, work started back, also parts of Europe, slower in US for all the
reasons that we know. We have also launched the third phase of this, which is what we're calling the workplace of
the future, which encompasses a lot of things that Eric is talking about. To your point on Boston, as we had
announced earlier, we are – we announced late last year that we are vacating this headquarters tower at the end
of 2022, going to – move to a new building in Boston, but is much more flexible, better terms, lower amount of

space. And it's early enough now that we have ability to customize that even further, given what we know about
COVID-19.
So, again, I don't believe that we could operate – or should operate anything near 90% work-from-home, but we
can operate on a much more flexible basis with work-from-home being an integral part of what we do. It's certainly
part of our disaster recovery now, so you should start to see us shedding disaster recovery spaces too and you
should expect and hold us to a much lower footprint really starting quite soon.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning guys. Eric, I was wondering if you give us a little bit more color underneath your full year
fee outlook. And I know, given that you've got the CRD comments you talked about and then transaction activity,
but can you kind of walk us through how you're now seeing the bigger buckets move both sequentially and year-
over-year given the – we see average asset pricing we have and your earlier comments about fee income
pressure moderating? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Sure, Ken. Part of the reason we gave an overall fee guide is that there is – there always are and there are
always going to be some ins and outs in that – in the various fees. I think if you think about the different buckets,
the texture that I gave against the full year guide of 1.5% to 2%, first on servicing fees, I think we feel positive.
We've delivered year-on-year growth in servicing fees now for – the first quarter year-on-year and then the
second quarter year-on-year and we think that will be a positive for the year. And that's different. I contrast that
the previous year where we had more fee headwinds or where we didn't feel like we had the performance we
would have liked, but we think servicing fees will be positive. And that's without an average equity market uptick
really, because globally equity markets are kind of in the more flattish range.
Management fees I think are doing well. We've been a little more negative there. We'd like to do a little bit better
than what we have done. FX trading and then all of the electronic services around that will be a clear positive, in
fact lending a little lighter as we've described some of the shifts there, or the area that we are working on.
And then in the software and processing fees, I think we're quite confident on the Charles River momentum,
especially with some of the recent wins. And then there is kind of the – there are some other – in that line, there
are some other business activity, our loan fees or other software fees et cetera and then there is some of the
lumpy stuff that we have to just take and mark. So, all in all though, full year, 1.5% to 2% is what we see today,
which, as I think gives us the positive momentum that we'd like and then something to build on for next year. And

our view is, if we can drive even low-single-digit fees upwards and continue to drive expenses down, we're getting
the right results.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. And one big picture one for Ron. Ron, last quarter you talked about the – a little bit of a push-off in either
installations and client discussions because of just everything that we're dealing with. Your win rate in servicing
was about flat. Can you talk – and you've talked about the potential wins in the CRD side of wealth management
platform. Can you just talk about just the conversations that are happening now and how that's evolving just in
terms of the core business and any sense if that's starting to open up at all?.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah, Ken. As we talked about last quarter, we said that it was our sense that just given the additional challenges
posed to asset managers and asset owners, operating models of COVID-19, that we thought that we'd see even –
at some point an increase in conversations, an interest in outsourcing and operating model changes in general.
And that's actually started to happen. And it started to happen in a big way in the second quarter. So, we see
continued interest in not just movement of back office to the lowest price, but much more about how do we
comprehensively improve – how do we – our asset owner or asset manager comprehensively improve our
operating model through changes to their back office and even to their front office. So that's continuing and it's –
as I noted in my opening remarks the – as a result of that we would expect to see and be in a position to
announce some significant new wins between now and the end of the year that are some combination of front,
middle and back office of notable names.

Thanks. Good morning Ron, good morning Eric. So, maybe just building on that last comment, I want to dig into
CRD a little bit more, as you think about the pipeline in CRD and sort of this sizable implementation opportunity
you guys see, what percentage of that is the on-premise versus kind of the SaaS-type of contract. And then
secondly, I was hoping you guys could dig into the CRD wealth strategy a little bit broadly. Thanks for some of the
added disclosure there But what kind of the – what are the typical sort of client in the wealth management space?
Is it a wirehouse, is it a independent broker-dealers [ph] and RAs (01:06:15)? So just a little bit more flavor there,
and which one of these channels incremental growth has been coming from. Thanks.

Why don't I start there? Eric can talk about the mix, Alex, but the – on the wealth channel, it tends to be the higher
– the larger wealth managers. And it's a combination, if I think about both – installed this quarter but also what's –
where we have conversations and will be installing in future quarters, it's a combination of the wirehouses – and
that obviously comes with lots of seats as you would imagine, but also the larger private wealth managers. I

mean, they could be RIAs, but again it tends to be the larger ones and the larger names. And if you think why that
is, oftentimes they're bringing – these institutions are bringing some fairly significant asset allocation capability to
bear. And while they want to give their advisors some freedom to customize, they also want to have a lot of
control over that and the CRD platform works really well in that regard.
And as I mentioned in response to a earlier question, the great thing for us is, is that this – it certainly is a
bespoke application for the wealth segment, but its leveraging much of the same underlying technology. So, there
is a lot of scale in all this both in terms of the initial development we've done, but also as we roll out software
improvements.

Eric W. Aboaf A

And Alex, just around that on the financials, we had a range of implementations this quarter on the on-premise
side, ones that are lumpier and the range was three years to eight years and it actually runs the gamut of 50% to
70% in the first year and then the balance ratably. I think the largest of implementations was actually on the close
to eight-year mark, which would be 50% in the first year and the other 50% in the coming years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got you. Thanks. And then just maybe to round out the discussion around NIR, so Eric, your comment around
kind of stabilizing NIR towards the end of the year, does that already contemplate significant reinvestment of
liquidity that you guys have built up on the balance sheet into securities and loans or with a little more
reinvestment to 2021, could we maybe even see a little bit of growth from that sort of trough level of net interest
revenues? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah, Alex, it's a little early to get into 2021 to be honest, but with the – the guide that I gave for 4Q does
contemplate some reinvestment in the investment portfolio and we're just kind of driving the balance, but the long
end range do have a, kind of a tail of effects for us. And so in a way this is the time for us to add to the investment
portfolio and do our work to offset what would naturally be a downward headwind. But I think we're – we've got a
path, it's just – it's hard to see growth in NII at this point, but we see a path to relative stability within a range, but
it's going to take some work. And we don't really know what happens with rates and how they evolve but the – we
can see a path there.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good morning Ron, good morning Eric.

Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Good morning.

Good morning.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Ron, can you follow up on the new wins that you guys gave us this quarter? And you have mentioned in your
comments about the stickiness of not losing customers. Are the wins primarily coming from existing customers
where you're adding more products and services? And in the cases where you win a new customer, I think you
alluded to lower prices. But can you share with us, is it price-driven that the new customers are coming over or is
it a combination of price and better products that you're offering them?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah, Gerard, I don't remember referring to lower pricing in the context of the wins, but to answer your questions,
it's a mix that we're seeing. And right now I'm referring to the, what we call our Alpha front-to-back platform and
Charles River. It's a mix of existing clients or new clients that we're seeing. At that's particularly true as I look at
the near-term pipeline. So, for those existing clients, in effect we're expanding our share of activity with them – to
use a vernacular, expanding the wallet where we might historically have had a back office custody relationship
and we're moving to the middle and the front office. But beyond that, in the kind of more traditional core business,
we continue to see a fair amount of outsourcing there too. Firms that had historically done everything but custody
inside, or where we might have been one or the only custodian are now reconsidering that and moving things like
fund accounting out. Middle office would be another big part of that because in fact our middle office business is
the outsourcing of their back office and that solves lots of challenges for them and we've learned how to scale that
business. So that would give you a sense of all that.
I mean what has been pleasing about the pipeline as it's developed – and again, given the comprehensive nature
of what we do, these pipelines do take a while to move from when there's the first contact to the actual signing of
the business. But what's pleasing about that is we're seeing a fair number of new clients there to us. And the
attractive thing about that is to really get the full advantage of the front-to-back platform. We're able to show that
we can do the Charles River and middle office for you, but where you are going to get real data advantages is
having the full front-to-back. So it fuels growth in our traditional back office business.

Gerard Cassidy Q

Very good. And then Eric, I know it's not as material to your business as a traditional bank, but your loan portfolio,
you mentioned you [ph] baked it in (01:13:44) some of the leveraged loans. Two questions, one can you give us

any color on the industries in which you de-risk a balance sheet from? And second, what type of pricing did you
see when you sold those leveraged loans? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Sure. Gerard, we are trying to be proactive here, right. The leveraged loan market has really moved up and down
a good bit and just finding some points where it might make sense. We de-risked roughly about $160 million of
balances of leveraged loans. I remember one of the cinema chains was in that and we got out of the good price. I
think the average pricing on the exits was around – I think around $0.92 I want to say on the dollar, so
somewhere in that range. So, we feel like we have made some good tactical decisions. It didn't cost us that much.
We would have to build a reserve anyway for those, and that's why I said on that, $160 million it cost effectively in
that fix. But for the peace of mind and just trying to be careful because we are a trusted custody bank and that's
our brand, we felt like it was a good trade. And we'll continue to selectively do that, but in truth we feel quite good
about this loan book. I mean it's a – most leveraged loans are – in the indices are single B and below. Ours are
BB, and sometimes even better. And so I think we're pretty confident here, but there is always something, and
we're happy to be proactive and make some tactical decisions, and that's what we did.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. So you're guiding for better fee growth for this year, 1.5% to 2% versus down before. How much of that is
already reflected in the first half results and how much should be coming in the second half? You mentioned
servicing fee, management fees, FX processing, but is this mostly reflecting what you've done already, or is it
mostly the comp? And as a subcomponent of that, when it comes to CRD I guess linked quarter revenues were
up $45 million and pre-tax was up $42 million, so I guess that's what, a 93% incremental profit margin. So that
leaves me to ask, are there some upfront revenues with the new business wins? In terms of timing between the
revenues and expenses how does that work out? And then honestly, if I can throw it in there, you were going to
be client of CRD and how is that moving along? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Sure, Mike, it's Eric. Let me take the first couple and then I think Ron will probably want to take the third. In terms
of the full year guide, you're right, there is a number of different pieces to it. There is some pieces of the full year
1.5 to 2% fee revenue guide that are driven by the first half of the year and there is some that will be driven by, I
think continued progress in the second half. I think if you just go through the line items, servicing fees has been
good for the first half and we expect them to we continue to be good, but I think that will be a continued story.
Management fees, largely because of the market, I think a little lighter in the first half. We're hoping that they
come in a little stronger on a year-on-year basis in the second half. FX, obviously a first-half story where the
second half will not be there.
Sec Finance has been light for us in the first half. We're hoping for some and looking for some stability there and
some sequential stability if not some – a little bit of uptick. And then you have Charles River where we obviously

got a big part in the second quarter, and that may be – end up being a little more first-half weighted, but I think
you typically get performance in the fourth quarter of these software businesses, so we'll see I think some activity
there.
So, a little bit of a mix to be honest. On Charles River, the – good question – on the on-premise installation in
particular, or the renewals – but I think it's really on a, kind of combination of the new implementations. You do get
some professional servicing fees where we build revenues and we incur expenses, and my recollection is those
are is fairly aligned. The accounting standards encourage us to do that. But I think the professional services tend
to be billed as incurred and then – and part of the, what I described as the more stable part of the revenues. And
what we're finding is, there is just a – there is professional services installation work that we do for, kind of coming
clients – clients that are not yet implemented but are on their way to implementation. There is some during the
implementation that last sprint and then there is clients behind that. So it's a bit of a mix to be honest, but
something we can try to parse out a little bit more detail in future conferences or calls.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Mike, regarding the last part of your question which is State Street Global Advisors becoming a client of Charles
River. They're actually becoming a client of the full Alpha front-to-back platform, including Charles River. So it's a
fairly comprehensive install and it's underway. The installation is happening.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Because you are going to be – like, that will be a nice showcase once you get that done. As you say, we use it
ourselves: you should use it too. Kind of what inning are you in as far implementing it internally?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
I mean, I'm somewhat speculating here now, but we're well over half installed is the way I would describe it. And
again, it's not just installing Charles River, but it's moving the State Street Global Advisors' back office to our
middle office platform. It's accommodating some existing technology that they have in place too. So as you'd
imagine, it's a $3.1 trillion asset manager. It's pretty complicated, but it's well over half way along.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And just one last clarification, Eric. So the CRD revenues, should we – $145 million in the second quarter and
should – I know, this is getting pretty granular, but is that something that's kind of lumpy, or we should extrapolate
that out, or how should we think about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
No, it's lumpy, and Mike that's why I was trying to give a little bit of color, but just to reaffirm. In that $145 million,
we said there are kind of very recurring really kind of – recurring revenues of just over $80 million, and then the
balance is in the, kind of lumpy category where you get these on-premise installations. So you kind of have to
take a piece of the lumpy and say, there is always going to be lumpy, because we have three-year contracts, five-
year contracts – three-year contracts, and every quarter every year there is – some of those contracts roll over,
and so you're going to get a new lumpiness, or you get new business that you add in the lumpy category.

I also gave if you want another quarter as a contrast. Back a year ago, second quarter of 2019 we have $90
million of total revenues and I said we had about $65 million of the very, kind of recurring SaaS and Professional
Services revenues, and just a smaller piece of that was lumpy. So you can kind of, I think draw some lines. And
the lumpiness, this is big lumpy, that's for sure, but there is always going to be some. But I think hopefully I have
given you enough on the, kind of SaaS and the Professional Services, the – you extrapolate from there and then
put in something in the models on the lumpy part.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. Your line is
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey, good morning. Maybe just we could talk a little bit of – a question on the new business wins you've had and
the cadence and impact. If I look at new business to be installed, you have about $1 trillion to go. That's been
pretty stable since the big wins in 3Q 2019. So, is it – on these bigger wins, does it just really take this long? Is
there something unusual here? And I guess going forward with the new business wins you've alluded to in the
second half this year, is it a similar kind of time to install?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah, Jim, it's a good question. When you see this kind of to-be-installed backlog if you will, that typically reflects
that there is multiple tranches of business. So for example, it could be custodian fund accounting and middle
office. And a custody conversion, we can do very quickly, right. We literally did some – we were notified by a
client that they wanted to move in the midst of the crisis and we got it done intra-quarter. Those move quickly, and
so oftentimes don't even show up in this backlog here – I mean, they would if it was carrying over to a quarter.
What you're seeing here is clients including some very large clients that have multiple tranches of business that
they are either moving over from an existing provider or in some cases moving from an in-sourced to an
outsourced model. And again, that reflects the nature of our business. We're using our ability to do these kind of
outsourcing to actually drive not just the outsourced business, but to drive traditional core custody which scales
easily and is quite profitable to us. But that's how you should think about that is that in any given quarter our new
business wins will be some very traditional custody-to-custody kinds of things or fund accounting to fund
accounting, but oftentimes a backlog reflects just much more comprehensive kinds of moves.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Right. And should we assume that those more complex deals have a higher fee rate? Should we see a little bit
more of a material impact on servicing fees when they close?
