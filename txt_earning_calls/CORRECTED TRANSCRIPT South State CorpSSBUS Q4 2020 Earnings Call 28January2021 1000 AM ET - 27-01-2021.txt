Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
Now, I will turn the call over to Robert Hill, Executive Chairman.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert R. Hill Jr.
Executive Chairman, South State Corp.
Good morning and thank you for joining us today. It's a pleasure to be with you and a pleasure to have the
opportunity to represent such a great group of people as we report our performance this quarter. Each quarter,
each month and each week, this team continues to make significant strides of creating a bank that John and I
were only dreaming about a couple of years ago.
I'm pleased with our performance in areas of soundness, profitability and growth, but I am even more pleased with
the leadership team and the culture that is being developed. I want to thank our team for a tremendous job in
2020. Great teams rise to the occasion in challenging times, and this team has certainly risen to the occasion.
I will now turn the call over to John Corbett.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett
Chief Executive Officer & Director, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Thank you, Robert. Good morning everyone. I hope you and your families are doing well and staying healthy. We
continue to make significant strides integrating CenterState and South State, and it's been gratifying to watch our
teams gel together and watch their confidence grow. Since closing, we've fully integrated the three lines of
business of Wealth, Correspondent and Mortgage. We've unveiled a new logo as well as launching a new website
and a new mobile app. And recently, the board formally adopted our combined core values and guiding principles.
At the same time, work continues to prepare for our upcoming systems conversion in May.
For the fourth quarter, the company produced earnings per share of $1.21 on a GAAP basis. Adjusting for merger
and other non-recurring items, earnings per share came in at $1.44 with a return on tangible common equity (sic)
[return on average tangible common equity] (00:03:13) of 15.4%. For the entire year, the company produced a
record PPNR of $629 million on a combined business basis, with only 2 basis points of charge-offs. Asset quality
remains strong with special mention and classified loans remaining flat from third-quarter levels, and payment
deferrals continue to trend down. We ended the quarter with just 1% of loans on deferral and two-thirds of those
are making interest payments.
On the revenue side, Correspondent Banking and Mortgage continue to outperform in this low-rate environment
and they help to offset industry-wide margin compression and sluggish loan growth. For 2020, our profits in
Correspondent Banking were double our 2019 profits, and Mortgage was almost four times as profitable.
Residential mortgage demand continues to be strong, but we intentionally slowed the mortgage pipeline in the
fourth quarter so that we could integrate the CenterState and South State mortgage computer systems together.
This resulted in a drop in mortgage income for the quarter, but we anticipate that mortgage will be a strong source
of fee income in 2021 now that the systems consolidation is complete.
We announced last quarter, our agreement to acquire Duncan Williams, a broker-dealer in Memphis, Tennessee.
We've now received all regulatory approvals for the acquisition and we anticipate closing the transaction on
February 1st. We're very excited to welcome Duncan to our South State team and to expand our Correspondent
platform by adding a broker-dealer.
With record low mortgage rates, we continue to see run-off in our residential portfolio, as our clients appropriately
refinance into our secondary market product. However, excluding the residential run-off of $203 million and PPP

forgiveness, the commercial loan portfolio did grow modestly in the fourth quarter. Commercial loan production
increased 24% from third-quarter levels and the pipeline now stands at $3.2 billion, which is close to the pipeline
levels pre-COVID.
Deposit growth continues to be strong with core deposits increasing over 12% annualized and we used some of
our excess liquidity last quarter to pay off a $700-million federal home loan bank advance, which will reduce our
interest cost over the next few years. Meanwhile, our deposit cost continue to move down to 17 basis points, a
3% reduction during the quarter. Now, I'll turn the call over to Will Matthews to provide additional detail.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corporation
Thanks, John. Our net interest margin was 3.14% on a taxable equivalent basis, down 8 basis points from Q3.
Loan yields of 4.27% were down 8 basis points from Q3. Accretion was $12.7 million for the quarter, down $9.6
million. And we recognized $16.6 million in deferred PPP fees in Q4, versus $8.5 million in Q3. So, if you consider
the net change in the two, reduced accretion income and increased PPP deferred fee recognition, they reduced
interest income by approximately $1.5 million from Q3. NIM, excluding accretion was 2.99%, up four basis points
from Q3. NIM excluding accretion and total PPP declined 4 basis points to 2.92%. Our loan repricing mix,
excluding PPP loans is 48% fixed, 30% floating and 22% adjustable.
Loans declined by $573 million or $155 million excluding PPP loans in the quarter, for a 2.7% annualized rate and
non-PPP loan declines. As John noted, absent declines in the single-family residential portfolio, ex-PPP loans
grew slightly on the quarter. We put some of our excess cash to work in the securities portfolio, which grew by
$710 million during the quarter. Our total cost of deposits improved another 3 basis points to 17 basis points for
the quarter. Our CDs are relatively short, with 72% coming due in this year. We continue to carry significant
liquidity, $4.5 billion on average, for the fourth quarter, weighing on our margin and we paid off the $700-million
FHLB advance in early December, so we had a partial benefit in our liability costs this quarter.
Turning to non-interest income, our non-interest income of $97.9 million was down $17 million from Q3, primarily
due to a $23-million decline in Mortgage banking revenue. Mortgage production of $1.41 billion was strong,
though down about 10% from Q3 levels, and cash margins remained healthy, up approximately 45 basis points
from Q3. As John said, the decline in Mortgage revenue was largely caused by a significant drop in the pipeline
and loans held for sale in advance of a mid-January systems integration. We continue to be a purchase-oriented
mortgage lender with purchase volume representing approximately two-thirds of our retail volume.
Our Correspondent Banking division had another good quarter with revenue of $27.7 million. We expect the
Duncan Williams acquisition to close February 1, so we should see a partial quarter's impact of this business in
Q1. We, again, welcome that team to the company.
Other non-interest income was up $4.5 million, approximately $3.5 million of which was a reduction of the CVA on
swaps. Steve has responsibility for these non-interest income business lines and he's available to answer
questions on them during the Q&A session. On expenses, NIE for the quarter was $278 million, including $20
million in merger-related expenses and $39 million in the FHLB payoff and related swap termination, for an
operating NIE of $219.7 million.
A couple of larger items of note in the quarter, we aligned with the methodology for accruing [ph] FICA (00:09:46)
on the [ph] synods (00:09:47) to recognize them in the year earned rather than at payment, resulting in a $3.3-
million accrual in Q4. We also spent $1.5 million with an outside vendor associated with an upgrade of our mobile
banking app and related call center activity. So, outside of these two unusual items, operating NIE was

approximately flat with Q3. We did spend a bit more on business development and employee recruiting and [ph]
interconnection (00:10:16) expenses were up about $1.2 million from Q3.
Our efficiency ratio was 60.2% excluding the merger-related expenses and the swap termination penalty. I'll note
that the $22-million hit to Mortgage revenue from the pipeline decline impacted our efficiency ratio by a little over
350 basis points. We continue to be on track with our cost saves and on merger-related expenses we've
recognized approximately 60% of the estimated $205 million to date, some of which occurred on the CenterState
side pre-closing.
Turning to credit on slide 9. Deferrals are now down to a little over 1% and we expect them to range between 1%
and 1.5% over the next several months. Our criticized and classified assets were approximately flat, down a few
basis points from Q3 levels. As John said, net charge-offs remained very low and were again below $1 million for
the quarter. Ending NPAs were 32 basis points of assets, down 1 basis point from Q3.
Our provisions for credit losses was $18 million for the quarter with another $200,000 for the reserve for unfunded
commitments liability. In our CECL modeling this quarter, we weighted two Moody's economic scenarios, the
Baseline and a Downside S3 scenario in light of the worsening COVID statistics and the potential that stimulus,
PPP, forbearance programs, et cetera may be masking losses incurred in the economy and in our portfolio that
are not yet realized.
On slide 8, our reserve coverage excluding PPP loans grew to 2.2% including the reserve for unfunded
commitments, or 2.01% just including the reserve for funded loans. Our loss absorption capacity ratio ended the
quarter at 2.62%, similar to the Q3 level. For the effective tax rate, as noted in the release, we had a one-time
benefit from an NOL carryback under the CARES Act. Excluding that, our effective tax rate for the quarter and
year was approximately 19%.
Turning to capital. Our capital ratios continue to grow in Q4 with our TCE ratio growing 27 basis points ending at
8.10%. Our CET1 and total risk-based ratios grew by approximately 30 basis points, ending at 11.8% and 14.2%.
Ending tangible book value per share was $41.16, up $1.33 from Q3, and up to $2.03 from the year-ago quarter.
I'll turn it back to you, John.

Thank you, Will. I would be remiss if I didn't close by thanking our South State team for a remarkable year in
2020. It's been exactly one year ago that we announced the merger of equals between CenterState and South
State. Over our first year together, we faced the challenges of enduring a worldwide pandemic, the economic
shutdown, the recession, the PPP stampede over Easter weekend, and the feelings of isolation of working from
home. And the South State team overcame all these challenges, while simultaneously navigating the most
complex thing you can do in banking, integrating a merger of equals.
They've done an outstanding job and I'm very proud of them. The groundwork we've laid in 2020 is going to pay
big dividends in the years to come.
I'll now turn the call back to the operator so we can open the line for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time,
we will pause momentarily to assemble the roster. The first question today comes from Jennifer Demba of Truist
Securities. Please go ahead.

Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Question. As we've talked to other management teams over the last week-and-a-half or so, it seems like there are
more and more opportunities to look at acquisition opportunities across the country. Just wondering what your
interest is now once you get past your systems conversions in May. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Good morning, Jennifer. This is John. Really nothing's changed from our message that we've delivered in the
past. We're in the middle of a large transaction and things are going very, very well, but we've still got a large
conversion ahead of us in May. So, that's where our focus is. That's where our attention is. But having said that,
this yield curve continues to stay low and flat that the whole industry is going to face these revenue headwinds.
And I think we want to remain opportunistic as we get past the conversion and keep our options open. I'm
continuing to have conversations with banks that we've talked to for many, many years. Just haven't gone to
second base with any of those conversations until we get past the conversion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Right. And you talked about the Mortgage pipeline declining intentionally in the fourth quarter. What are you
seeing here in the first quarter in terms of production trends and how strong do you think Mortgage could be in
2021?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corporation
Yes, Jennifer. It's Steve. As it relates to Mortgage, just to kind of back-up for a second, on – if we were a
combined entity in 2019, the production of the Mortgage bankers would have been about $3.2 billion. In 2020, on

a combined business basis, we did about $5.5 billion. A really good pickup there. In the fourth quarter, our
closings were about $1.4 billion so that annualizes out somewhere in that $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion range. We're
cognizant of the MDA forecast that the Mortgage will be down 20%, 25% next year. Having said that, we do have
a much higher mix, as Will mentioned, to purchase than most others and so, this quarter, it was close to two-
thirds.
And so, as we got the systems converted and put in in the middle of January of this month, it is very nice to see
everybody on one system and to be able to manage it on one system. So, we're seeing robust activity again.
Mortgage is always hard to predict, but we would expect – because of our markets and others, we should be in
good shape for 2021.

Operator: The next question comes from Michael Rose of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey, good morning. Hope you all are well. I guess the biggest question that I have, you guys built the reserve a
little bit. This quarter you talked about deferrals ranging kind of around these levels. Credit metrics generally
moved in the right direction. We've seen a lot of other banks talk about declining reserves or reserve releases as
we move forward. Obviously, you guys are in really strong markets and then you kind of talked about some of the
stimulus programs masking some losses. So I guess I'm trying to reconcile this and with the credit market and
everything, why not have a more positive kind of outlook on credit just given what we're seeing in the metrics?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corporation
Sure Michael, good morning, it's Will. And maybe I'll start. I think – our thought is that as the Fed noted, the
economy's path is dependent upon the virus. And our view at the end of the year was that there was enough
uncertainty around the virus, whether it's new strains, the dissemination of vaccines, herd immunity, et cetera, that
a reserve release at this point, based on what we know would have been too early and would not have been
appropriate. We also saw at this point, December Jobs Report after the day of the Moody's forecast, and I'd just
say, looking forward, as the picture becomes clearer and forecasting improvement and economic factors
becomes less difficult, that could result in reserve releases at that time.
If you look at our position relative to peers, we would argue that our credit quality is very good, results have been
very good, and clearly our reserve position is higher than many, which we think puts us in a very good position,
regardless of the economy we face.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Yeah. And Michael, it's John. Let me just add on to what Will said about the reserve. Where we are with the
reserve is due to national factors not our franchise. I mean, we're following these models, these national models,
but if you look at the credit performance, as you mentioned, this bank has had three quarters in a row with only 1
basis point of charge-off. So, we think the underwriting is sound, deferrals are way down. We're feeling – every

day we're feeling better and better and more optimistic that we've turned the corner relative to credit. But there is
national phenomenon going on and we wanted that reflected in the loan loss reserve. But as far as our own book,
every day we feel better.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. So, it sounds like maybe just you guys are being conservative just given more the macro at this point as
opposed to anything on your own portfolio. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just one more for me. It looks
like the pipelines were up a little bit. I know everybody is having paydown issues. We had some – you talked
about the mortgage issue. Would you expect kind of paydowns to slow as we kind of move through the year? And
I guess ex-PPP and some of the run-off from the acquired book, what's kind of the core loan growth outlook for
the year? I assume it's going to be a little bit slower in the front half, but probably accelerating in the back-half like
others have talked about. Any sort of initial stab at what growth could look like given the strong pipeline? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Yeah. I think that's right. And as I tried to articulate in the prepared remarks, we did see loan growth in our
commercial loan portfolio a little bit this quarter. It's really the residential pay-offs that are creating such a
headwind, but that residential payoff is – we're controlling that product into the secondary market and making
these fees. So, I do feel like we're turning the quarter on credit. Get more optimistic each day. If I had to guess, I
think we'd head into 2021 we're probably into low to mid-single digit growth and I do think it will pick up more on
the back-end of the year than the front, but encouraged pipeline-wise before the pandemic, the pipeline was
about $3.4 billion. At the low last summer, it got down to $2.4 billion and I looked at it this morning, we're back up
to $3.3 billion. So, it's really, really close.
I do want to be cautious however from an underwriting standpoint. The world is awash with liquidity right now and
everybody's trying to put this liquidity to work. And as I talk to Dan and others about credit, we are seeing some
competitive forces where there is some structure creep in deals, where people are becoming more aggressive as
far as being willing to drop guarantees and lower down-payments. So, we think there's opportunities, but we're
going to pass on some of them as well, if the structures get too loose.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I wanted just one clarifying question on the loan losses revenue, answer was good there about the models versus
your markets and your book. But Will, when you talked about kind of looking at two different scenarios, the base
case and the S3, I think you called it, was that a changed quarter-over-quarter or is that kind of the same mix you
had in the scenario waiting as the quarter before?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corporation
You know, Stephen it was a change. We were baseline-only before. And so, we did [ph] weight in (00:23:55) a
more pessimistic scenario for part of the weighting this quarter, so that was the change.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect. Thank you. And then, I guess with the balance sheet, you know, I think the mention was $4.5 billion, give
or take, of excess liquidity and you noted $710 million in securities purchases this quarter, but as it looks like
liquidity it seems is going to hang around for a little bit longer, what could we continue to see in the securities
book and what are you seeing on new investment yields there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corporation
So, Stephen, it's Steve. You're right. We still continue to have a fair amount of excess liquidity. When we did see
the – after the election rates rose, we took the opportunity to buy a little bit higher yield. So, I thought that
[indiscernible] (00:24:43) more of an opportunity. As we think about that portfolio, historically, the way we've
thought about it is the percentage of assets and so, today, we're not quite to 12% of assets, but we have tried to
manage that 12% to 13% of assets.
Obviously, we're all not sure how the excess liquidity is going to play out over the next few quarters. But – and we
also want to make sure that we're not locking into investments that really don't give you a whole lot of yield at the
lowest rates. But I guess from my perspective, I think the way to think about this model is somewhere between
12% and 13% of assets until we change anything in the future. I hope that's helpful. But, you know, as far as
going on yields, we're pretty vanilla there. We like to put the investments out for liquidity. So our going on yields
are somewhere between 1.25% to 1.5% on these purchases.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. Very helpful. And then just last thing for me, thinking about the 3.5 million share repurchase,
obviously your stock has done very well I think in this kind of recovery environment we've seen in the group, but
you're also building capital extremely rapidly. So, how aggressive could you remain with the share repurchases
from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Yeah, Stephen, this is John. I mean I think what you've always heard from us is that we feel like our role is to be
active capital allocators. This reauthorization the board gave us yesterday, gives us 3.5 million shares, which is
about 5% of the company and as you noted, the capital formation rate is pretty strong, mid-teens, ROTCE and

with all the liquidity it's unlikely that we're going to grow our balance sheet. So, we see that capital rate continue to
build.
So, all I would tell you is the buyback is in place to maintain maximum optionality and it's something we look at
quarter-by-quarter. We don't budget it in. It's not a budgeted item for us. We look at just facts and circumstances
of how we can deploy capital every quarter, but we have been active in the past and now we have that flexibility
going forward.

I wanted to just follow-up on just your big-picture thoughts on the outlook for the core net interest margin pulling
out PPP and pulling out the impact of accretive yields.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Yes. Hey, Catherine, it's John. I'm going to let Steve answer that, but I'll make a couple of comments about NIM
before he does. It's such an important driver of the performance of the bank. However, we benefited this past year
2020 from having some diversified revenue beyond NIM, and for 2020, even with the yield curve doing what it
was, the company, we beat the consensus forecast for the calendar year. I think a year ago before we announced
the merger, it was $597 million. We actually, as a combined business company, did $629 million. So, it was about

And the yield curve, as we think about it, it can go in two directions here. We could wind up in a prolonged
recession and the yield curve could remain low and flat. And if it does, our NIM is going to continue to compress. I
mean we've hit the floor on deposit costs. We got it down to 17 basis points. So, we can't really push that lever
anymore. But, in that scenario, that prolonged recession we're going to continue to see fee income businesses
outperform. If you go back to 2019, the fee income businesses on a combined basis did $309 million. This past
year it jumped to $421 million. So, big increase to offset the NIM. And what you're going to get with South State in
a – for a long recession is you're probably going to get better asset quality performance. If you look at the last
three quarters, 1 basis point of charge offs, only 1% deferral and we've got a very strong reserve over 2%.
On the flip side, if we flip to a recovery mode where the yield curve steepens and it's sort of what we started to
see here in the last month or two with the stimulus, probably what you're going to see is our fee businesses are
going to pull back. But our margin, we think, is going to open quite a bit faster than most in the industry because
our core deposits, again, is so strong, and that we're going to get more than our fair share of loan growth because
of the markets we're in. But, in this recessionary environment, with that diversified fee income, it's given us a 15%
mid-teens ROTCE. Boy, if the rates go up, if the yield curve steepens, we look for that return on equity to go back
in the upper-teens and maybe closer to 20%. So, that's a big picture of how the business is performing as a whole
and the puts and the takes, but specifically, Steve, if we round up where the yield curve stayed where it is today,
how does that look?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corporation
Yes, John, and to answer your question a little bit more direct, Catherine, if the rate forecast is similar to where we
are now for the year 2021 and we assume the low to mid-single digit loan growth in 2021 and the last assumption
is we assume the fourth-quarter net interest income dollars is kind of the baseline, we would expect low to mid-
single digit percentage decline in net interest income in 2021. Naturally, it would be better if the yield curve gets
steeper and the rates rise and just to further that last point, back to our core deposits, we – checking makes up
54% of our total deposits. We have about 800,000 checking accounts and a 17-basis-point cost of deposits. So,
as we think about the NIM, that's sort of how we think about it for 2021.

Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Hey, good morning, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Hey, Kevin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Most of my modeling questions have been asked and answered. Just maybe taking a step back, more of a
bigger-picture issue. Now, we've been, you know, as you all mentioned a year from the MOE getting announced
and now you've had, you know, a little – little over half a year of being together and you're coming up to the main
conversion in May. I'm just curious if you take a step back – and I know we've been dealing with a different
environment than you guys envisioned when this was announced, but would have been – what had been some of
the main positive takeaways or surprises, and maybe something that's a little more challenging than you might
have envisioned when you announced this deal, sitting in hindsight today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Yeah, Kevin. So, you know, between our two companies, you now, the CenterState, probably has [ph] in all done
(00:32:39) acquisitions last decade or so, South State, a large number of acquisitions. There's a lot of experience
here, but an MOE is different and I would tell you looking back on it, what makes it different is the – is the volume
of decisions that have to be made and the volume of change that occurs. If you do it right, if you get in a room and
you look at the best practices of both companies, and you take the time to choose the best path forward, you're
going to wind up with a better company, better-run company than either company would have been stand-alone.
But it takes a lot of effort to have those discussions, you know, objectively make those decisions and that's what
we're doing. I mean, the South State franchise had some processes in place with technology that CenterState
bankers are just thrilled to take advantage of. One of them is the new mobile app that we put in place at legacy
South State last month. We added 300,000 checking account users to that platform. The CenterState clients will
go on it in May. South State's got a great treasury platform. CenterState has great capital markets through the
Correspondent banks. So, the challenge in the work is taking the time to make the right decisions and it's just a
high volume, but the end product is every bit as good as we hoped it would be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
That's great. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up on the question before on M&A and your potential interest
there. On one hand, you guys have a very strong geographic franchise. So, how do you weigh the opportunities
for more scale versus what – where exactly you want to be from a franchise perspective? Because I'm assuming
there's probably some states or some markets you don't have interest in, but when you look at the southeast in
general, I would assume your primary interest would be in markets you're are already in. But how – what's high on
your list of interests in terms of markets you're not currently in? Thanks.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
Yes. Kevin, back to your comment, we don't believe in M&A for the sake of scale only. I mean, that's not the
primary driver. It's got to make financial sense to do a deal, but if we had our [indiscernible] (00:35:17)
strategically, we would love to continue to dial down and build density in these high-growth urban markets in the
southeast. We love the markets we're in, in Charlotte, Greenville, Atlanta, Charleston, you get down to Florida in
the Orlando, Tampa, Jacksonville markets, we would love to continue to build density in those markets. And if
interest rates stay low and there continues to be expense pressures, I think we've got a track record of being able
to consolidate banks that have branch overlap. If you look at the last decade, we've acquired over 400 branches
and consolidated over 200 branches, and that's driven our average branch size from $27 million to now it's well
over $100 million. I think it's $108 million. Now, whether or not all those stars will line up that would be what our
preference would be.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Hey, Brody.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
I've got a handful of questions. I'll just I'll just ask some of them now and then maybe hop back in the queue to
see if I got a chance to hop back on. But I just wanted to clarify something on the Mortgage. So, I appreciate the
color around the reduction in the closings. It looks about 12.5% off the quarterly run rate from earlier in the year
on a combined business basis. But I'm assuming a slowdown more dramatically impacted the locked pipeline,
given the swing in the fair value marks. So, I just wanted to get a sense for what the decrease was in the locked
pipeline in 4Q relative to 3Q and then how that's shaping up in 1Q now that you've got the conversion behind you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corporation
Yeah, Brody. This is Steve. You're exactly right. It's related to the locked pipeline. I believe the numbers, I don't
have them quite in front of me, but – here it is, $954 million at the end of the third quarter versus $674 million at
the end of the fourth quarter. If you look at our cash gain on margin, if you just looked at it from that perspective in
the fourth quarter, we were in the 4.5% range versus the third quarter as well over 4%. And that's back to the
intentional nature of what we were trying to do in order to convert the systems and raise margins on our way into
this system conversion.

And so, obviously, that's going to bring less volume, less pipeline, but as we get the systems converted here in
January, now we kind of get back to normal and more normal margins and more normal locks. So, hopefully that's
helpful as you think about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yes. Now, that's very helpful. I appreciate that. And then just on the incentive expense that you called out, I
wanted to ask if that was more of a true-up for the year that maybe won't reoccur moving forward or is that
something that will stay in the run rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Yeah. Brody, it really reflects two different methodologies. One company expensing it at the time of payment and
one company accruing it in the year of being earned. And so, we moved to the methodology where we are
accruing it in a year earned. So, it's a catch-up in the fourth quarter, but of course we'll be paying [ph] FICA
(00:38:44) expense on all incentives going forward. But one-half the company I guess would have expensed it in
the first quarter when it paid out for last year's incentives.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Understood.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Makes sense?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. It does. And then core C&I growth on the quarter was actually pretty strong, about 12% annualized. And so,
I wanted to ask was there anything specific that drove that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corporation
Yeah. We continue to see great activity in our middle market bank that we've been building. We've had great luck
from a recruiting standpoint. We – I think we issued a press release sometime in the fourth quarter where we've
hired nine commercial bankers, two middle-market bankers that were in Jacksonville. Some of them are up in
Charlotte. So, just the activity, the energy in our C&I middle-market bank is very, very strong. So I would look for
that to continue.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then last one for me right now and I'll pop back into the queue. John, thanks for the color on
how the pipeline stacking up. It's good to see it sort of back up almost to year-ago levels. I wanted to ask what's
the – what's the sort of historic pull through rate on the pipeline?

Operator: The next question comes from Chris Marinac of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey thanks. Good morning. I know Will talked a little bit about the cost of sort of new hires or just the expenses
related to that. I was just curious John or whomever, what's your outlook for that in general? How competitive is
it? And do you have a sort of I guess an internal goal of new producers that you'd like to recruit this next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Yeah. I talked to Greg Lapointe who's our Chief Banking Officer the other night and the opportunity set for hiring
commercial bankers, middle-market bankers from some of the largest banks in the country is better than we've
ever seen. And these are not the B&C bankers. These are folks that have spent their entire careers at some of
these banks and they're 20-, 30-year-veteran bankers. So, you know, we're going to continue to pursue those and
again, it's kind of like the buybacks Chris. It's not something you really budget. You just take advantage of it when
the opportunity is there.
Greg said the other night, I think he's talking to another nine people in Atlanta, the Carolinas, in Florida. So, you
know, there's occasionally there's retirements and turnover those kinds of things. But we'll just update you every
quarter and we're not putting a limit on how many great bankers we're going to [ph] have at (00:42:09) the
company.

would happen in the next couple of quarters from a seasonal standpoint?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
Stephen Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corporation
Sure. Let me try to take a step back and maybe because we have [indiscernible] (00:42:33) position and so on.
Let me try to help bring that up for you and maybe help frame up the entire fee income businesses. As it relates to
Correspondent, this year was just a record year. [ph] Brad James (00:42:50) who [indiscernible] (00:42:50) has
done a phenomenal job. Our fee income was approximately $110 million on a combined business basis this year.
Last year, it's around $60 million, $65 million. So, it's up $50 million. Most of that increase was driven, our interest
rate swap product and of course fixed income got a little bit better. You know, as we think about how that rolls into
our forecasts for fee income, it really – our guidance really hasn't changed from the last quarter.
And we talked about Mortgage and the potential declines there and really we don't see anything changing for
2021 based on what happened in the fourth quarter, but we would expect just total fee income to decrease from
the whole 2020 level which was around $420 million, but approximate the fourth quarter levels, which is about
10% below the 2020 level.
So, as we think about the entire bucket of fee income, we've got some puts and takes in there. We went from
$309 million to $420 million. Mortgage is going to be a little bit more challenging. The interest rate swap
environment will not be probably as robust. But it will be offset by our acquisition of Duncan Williams and the fixed
income there. So, hopefully – I know there's a lot of moving parts in there but hopefully that helps frame up how
we're thinking about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. And again, 10% applies to the whole fee income not just to correspondent? Is that right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Dean Young A

That's correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

may see this year? Thanks.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corporation
Yeah. Good question, Catherine. Remember last year our numbers we did almost 20,000 loans for $2.4 billion.
We turned the portal on a little over a week ago for round 2, and right now, we've got 52,100 applications or $600
million. So, right now, where we stand after about 8 or 9 days of having the portal open, we're at about 25% of
what we actually did last year.
But talking to Richard Murray, who's driving the program for us, the applications were really strong the first couple
of days and they started slowing down somewhat. So, if you had to ask him about the crystal ball where we wind
up, we're guessing that we might wind up in the 40% to 50% of what we did last year round 1, which would mean
maybe it winds up in the $1 billion to $1.2 billion range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corporation
And, Catherine, this is Steve. Let me just add to that on the round 1 forgiveness. I know that that's been a
question and the timing and model there. In the fourth quarter, we had about $400 million forgiven in the fourth
quarter. And as John mentioned, we're really focused on helping our clients with PPP round 2 and putting
forgiveness a little bit on the back burner just because we need to get the new funds into our clients' hands. And
so, we would expect there to be forgiveness that's probably similar in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter,
but it should be heavier in the second and third quarter. So, hopefully that helps you from a modeling as we think
about the forgiveness.
And then, the last thing, I know Chris asked me and I did not actually answer, was just around the seasonality of
our fee income. And he's right, there is some seasonality typically in the first quarter and, yeah, it's a little lighter
generally around Mortgage and Correspondents. Historically, been that way and always worked out that way, but
typically it's a little bit a little strong – a little bit weaker, and then it strengthens during the year. Hopefully that
helps.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yes. Thanks. Thanks. guys. I just wanted to ask a couple of follow-up questions on the NIM. Core loan yields ex-
PPP and accretion continue to hold up fairly well following the combination. And so, I wanted to ask if you could
give us a sense for what the roll-on, roll-off looks like right now? What your new origination yields versus what's
are rolling off the back book?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corporation
Brody. It's Steve. If you look at our loan yield and look at it ex-accretion and ex-PPP loans, for the fourth quarter,
our loan yield was 4.08%. Our new production yields in the fourth quarter came on around 3.37%. And so, that's
the two numbers. I think in the third quarter our new production yields were around 3.50%. So – and the yield

curves moved back up so, we'll probably – as you think about 2021, I would think that new loan yields will
probably be in the 3.5% range for the year depending on where the yield curve is of course.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Understood. I guess I was looking back at sort of legacy CenterState and South State exclusive, and
looking back a couple of years ago at what are origination yields look like. And they were 4.5%, 5% somewhere in
that range sort of consistently. And so, I wanted – that's sort of what I was getting at. Is there sort of a higher
yielding back-book that might be rolling off in the near term or was there repricing that occurred since that time,
just given the fixed versus floating nature of the book that is mitigating that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corporation
Yeah. No huge difference. I mean, you know, typically we're putting on a five-year duration [indiscernible]
(00:49:24). So, you know, what we're rolling off today is what we rolled off – or put on in 2016, or repricing today.
So, 2016, the environment was totally different than it was, you know, in 2019 and 2020 when the rates were
higher. So, no significant difference to the overall average I would say.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. I appreciate that. And then on accretion, I didn't see it in the release. You had a table in last quarter's
release. So, I wanted to ask what the ending balance of the unrecognized accretion on acquired loans was? And
also, how much PAA is left over from the legacy South State portfolio from the acquisitions that they had done?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corporation
Yeah, Brody. It's, Will. On slide 8, on that loss absorption capacity slide, we've got about $97.7 million, at 12/31 in
the remaining unrecognized discount. I can't cite for you the amount of that, that is on older acquisitions, it would
be a – an insignificant amount, but I don't know the numbers precisely.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And so, as I think about accretion moving forward, you know, there's a pretty good step down this quarter
from the $22 million to the $12 million. And so, I just wanted to get a sense for what you all thought the run rate on
accruable yield would look like in 2021?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corporation
Yeah. And if you'll recall – you listen to a million – participated in a lot of calls every quarter, but if you recall our
last quarter, we had some discussion around the difficulty in predicting accretion, and I would refer everyone back
to those comments. But having said that, I would also say, Q4 feels a lot more representative than Q3, where in
Q3 we had $22.5 million roughly and Q4 it was $12.5 million. That feels – given the remaining balance, that feels
like a more normalized level, but it is not a scientifically accurately prediction, but that feels more like a normalized
level.
