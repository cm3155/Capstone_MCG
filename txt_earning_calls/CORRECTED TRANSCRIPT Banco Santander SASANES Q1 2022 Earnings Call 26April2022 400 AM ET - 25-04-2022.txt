First Quarter of 2022. Just as a reminder, both the results report and the presentation we will be following today

José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Begoña, Good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning. We're going to – I'm going
to start with the first quarter results, starting with the activity levels of the group, in the quarter where we continue
to have a good customer activity, customer and building activity. We keep growing the customer base, 2 million
more customers in the quarter, 7 million more since March 2021. This is reflect our growing business and an
increased customer satisfaction. As you know, this is one of our goals and we rank in the top three in NPS in
markets now.
While the transactionality and the digital adoption keep growing a good base, 49 million – almost 50 million digital
customers, 5 million more than in March 2021. And transactions in digital channels are growing at 50%. And that
the digital opportunities has gotten a good pace.
As a result of this, our volumes in the balance sheet be in loans and deposits kept growing, both quarter-on-
quarter and year-on-year. And we translate this into a customer revenue growth that you're going to see in our
P&L.
So, going to the performance results and profitability. The Q1 attributable profit was €2.5 billion, €2.54 billion, 19%
versus first Q 2021 and underlying profit on 58% year-on-year when we compare with the attributable profit.
Remember that last year, we print around €500 million restructuring costs that we don't have this year.
On the cost side, and this is particularly important in this unexpected high inflationary environment, we were able
to – the cost to remain well below inflation and allow us to improve our efficiency ratio in line with our guidance of
getting 45%. We improve our profitability ratios quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year. Our return on tangible equity
went to 14.2% and EPS growing at 22% compared with Q1 2021.
We continue to create value for shareholders. The tangible net asset value per share stood at €4.29, 4% up
quarter-on-quarter and 13% up year-on-year including the cash dividends. When we go to the balance sheet and
we look at the risk particularly credit risk, the cost of credit remains relatively stable at 0.77% and below our
guidance for the whole year. And NPL ratio stays at 3.26%. Remember that in the quarter, we have like-for-like
basis without these [ph] nearly finishing up before (00:03:53). The NPL ratio fell like 10 basis points or something
like that.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
The core equity tier 1 was above 12%, 12.05%, while good organic capital generation 40 basis points from Q1
2022 earnings and minus 23 basis points from dividend accrual on the second buyback, share buyback that is
going on and started mid-March.
So, going to our P&L, let me say that remark that the churn rates play in a positive way, [ph] 4 or 5 percentage
points (00:04:36) you have in the third and fourth column in the slide in current euros and constant euros is –
current euros is [ph] 4 or 5 percentage points (00:04:43) or more, partially offset by hedging in the Corporate
Centre that our CFO will elaborate later on that we have a negative in – due to the hedging of the expected
profits.
As I mentioned earlier, we are a net profit of more than €2.5 billion, growing strongly year-on-year. In the quarter,
attributable – our underlying profit recorded the same amount and we had no extraordinary charges. I will
elaborate in the different lines on the P&L later on. When we look at the regions, we see that well, we are around
30% in each of the main regions, Europe, North America, and South America and the retail consumer bank
around the 10%.
Well, in addition to the revenues and profit also received [indiscernible] (00:05:33) from costs growing below
average inflation. We will see later on control loan loss provisions and lower minority interest following the
acquisition mainly of the Santander Consumer US minorities.
The quarterly [indiscernible] (00:05:52) reflects our sustained profit growth quarter after quarter bucket but what I
mentioned, customer revenue growth, the quarter comparison of NII is affected [indiscernible] (00:06:06). So, on a
like-for-like basis, we are growing 1% to 2% in constant euros NII. Q-on-Q fee income continue to increase,
positive performance in the majority of the countries partially offset by seasonality in South America mainly in
Brazil.
Cost increased quarter-on-quarter, thanks to our cost discipline and partly due to bonus adjustment at the end of
– in the fourth quarter of 2021. In addition, loan loss provisions remained flat year-on-year and up quarter-on-
quarter driven by the provision released in the fourth quarter of circa €750 million. Trends in euros were better, as
I said, than in constant euros as [ph] growth (00:06:54) rates were higher benefiting from the positive FX impact in
the quarter.
So when we go in deep into the revenue, revenues were north of €12 billion. Net interest income and fee income
accounted 95% of total income. By line, NII grew 6% in constant euro due to greater volumes and higher interest
rates by country. And at constant exchange rates, significant rises were recorded in UK, plus 15%, Poland, plus
78%, Brazil 7%, Mexico 7%. And on the other hand, Spain was affected by the changes of mix and lower ALCO
portfolio and Portugal by ALCO portfolio disposals that we executed in Q1 2021.
Net fee income amounted to €2.8 billion, plus 6% in cost in constant euros driven by improved activity notably in
high value added products and services. You have the figures in the slide in great, good levels of activity in cars,
insurance premiums, POS turnover, mutual and pension, all the fees all across the board significant increase in
activity levels that translated into higher fees.
In costs, as I mentioned at the beginning, while working in a high inflationary environment, we are focusing here in
two main points. One is to make sure that our costs grow less than inflation. This is the minus 3.3% in real terms
that we achieved. That's particularly important. And the second one is to keep improving our efficiency. That
improved [ph] 1.2% (00:08:40) going to the 45%. As you know, this is one of our key targets. When we go by

regions, we are delivering, I suspect, according to our plans in Europe in a much more difficult environment,
yeah?
So it's true that we are showing here with the different reporting in Europe, but we are not far away, I think, the
CFO already guide you that the €1 billion cost savings are going to be more in the region of €800 million affected
by inflation. But we are progressing very well in both in Spain, Portugal and UK and also in Poland in a high
inflationary environment. And we continue to deliver according to our plans affected somehow by inflation in non-
personal expenses that are much more difficult to control.
In North America, growing well below inflation, North America, US and Mexico [ph] minus 2.7% (00:09:38) that is
a good achievement. You've seen the results of our other players in the same markets where cost control has
been difficult to achieve.
And in South America, well, the figure since pretty high, Argentina is there, but also in Brazil where the inflation is
running above 10%. And there [ph] have been good with unions (00:10:01) in Brazil that the sector signing
September last year was in the region of 10%, 11% and translate into significant higher costs, in line – a bit higher
than inflation. I do expect in Brazil to enter into two quarters of having the expenses growing less than they grew
in the last two quarters on the back of our efficiency plans. And digital consumer bank that is growing above
inflation due to the – some initiatives and change in perimeter last year.
The cost of credit, well, the credit quality indicators remain stable. No significant impact from the war in Ukraine.
We have no exposure to Ukraine or Russia. As you already know, our cost of credit, 77 basis points. If you look at
the only – the last three month is 83 basis points. As you can see later in the country review that provisions
normalize after releases in Q4.
The NPL ratio, 3.26%, 19 basis points come from the new definition of default, otherwise, the NPL ratio in a like-
for-like basis would be 307%. The loan reserves and the coverage remains relatively stable. In coming quarters,
the implications of the impact of the current geopolitical situation and our business performance and credit quality
are still relatively uncertain, and we don't know the extent of the duration of the conflict. However, I should say
that our starting point is very solid.
So the group diversification enable us the resiliency to face the crisis. I mentioned that our exposure to the parts
in the conflict is negligible. We have enough tools in our hands to make us confident that we will meet our
expected [indiscernible] (00:12:10) cost of risk of below 1% in – even in the new scenario.
When it comes to capital, our capital ratio, we deliver – we had a very good organic capital generation. Gross
organic capital generation in the quarter was 40 basis points on the back of the good results I just present to you.
23 basis points when – to the shareholder remuneration, 15 basis points for the share buyback, and 8 basis point
for the accrual of our 40% payout policy. That's basically – and the other impacts are relatively minor regulatory
models and markets and overall activity minor effect.
In coming quarters, we will maintain our clear focus on – of the implementation of disciplined capital allocation
measures across the group and the achievement of the targets we announced in Q4. In this regard – well, risk-
weighted assets are growing below loan growth. Our front book is already delivering high risk-adjusted return. We
generate a RoRWA of 2.8% in Q1 2022. The presentation of risk weighted assets that do not cover the cost of
equity, keeps falling. And this is a good sign of our future profitability.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
Well, our policy to remunerate the shareholders and the dividends, the €3.4 billion dividends split in 50/50 in cash,
dividend and share buybacks.
The second share buyback program with a maximum of €865 million started on March 15 and we are – is under
execution as we speak. As a result, the total shareholder remuneration is €3.4 billion, 6% [ph] due (00:14:07). In
2022, our policy, dividend policy that was stated by the board and we reiterate in our AGM.
When we look at the capital – the profitability ratios, you can see in the slide both EPS, return on tangible equity,
tangible net asset value per share going in the right direction on the back of excellent capacity of the bank to
generate results on a recurring and sustainable basis.
Finally, before I hand to José, I would like to highlight Santander's strong commitments to ESG. You have in the
slide our commitments and how are we progressing in the different communities that we have been. In green
finance, where we already originate €69 billion since 2019, our commitment is €120 billion by 2025. We continue
to seek good demand and there is significant investment going in this field and we are participating on this.
We are developing green products. At the same time, we are developing – starting to develop an information
system that allows us to track how our portfolio behaves in relation with CO2 emissions and this is an important
tool that we need to implement in order to track all our progress here.
Well, in the asset management industry, we have also targets. You have the figures in the screen. In renewable
energy, we are world leaders and we are signing alliances in order to make progress in this field. The
decarbonization targets, you have there our commitments both in the mainly related with the power sector and
while we are progressing in line with our targets. These goals are included in the executive's long-term incentive
scorecard that show how committed we are with these ESG targets, particularly, I was referring here in the screen
today, but you know that we are also very active in the social – particularly in the social target particularly in the
microcredit space in Latin America.
So, I hand over to José that continues the presentation with the results by regions and global businesses.

José Antonio García Cantera
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, José Antonio, and good morning, everyone. As usual, I will start with a brief summary of the regions
and then I will move on to the countries to discuss in a bit more detail. We continue to leverage the – one of the
strengths of our model, which is diversification and scale, improving the operating performance in all three regions
and global businesses.
In Europe, we are making significant progress in the transformation of our business and in developing a common
operating model. We achieved double-digit growth in net operating income and profit, reaching a 13.5% return on
tangible equity.
In North America, we are refocusing our position in the US while maintaining a disciplined capital allocation. We
accelerated growth and volumes, generated a return on tangible equity of 24%. South America, we are growing
the number of customers and capturing new business opportunities, delivering almost 27% return on equity.
And in the digital consumer bank, new lending increased by 17% and profits rose double-digits with a return on
tangible equity of almost 13%. Obviously, we achieved all of these while enhancing our global business and
connectivity with the regions, in this way, SCIB, Consumer – sorry, Corporate & Investment Bank and a return on

tangible equity of 25% and Wealth Management & Insurance return on tangible equity was 55%. We continue to
make progress in the development of PagoNxt, we'll talk about that in a minute, maintaining high profitability in
our Card business with a return on tangible equity around 30%.
So moving to Europe, the business transformation to develop is simpler and a common operating model is
delivering good results, with increased volumes especially in individuals, mortgages were up 6%, consumer
lending was up 9%, mutual funds up 3%. We experienced significant improvements in customer satisfaction
surveys at the same time. Profit reached €1 billion in the quarter, increasing 30% year-on-year. Revenue grew
strongly, NII was up 9% supported by higher volumes and interest rate hikes in Poland and in the UK. Fee income
grew 7% backed by greater activity.
Our efficiency plans continue to bear fruit as the cost base shrunk 2%, went down 7% in real terms, and the
efficiency ratio improved to around 48%, driving net operating income up by 12%. Loan loss provisions dropped
14% as the cost of credit started to normalize across countries, most notably in Spain. Return on tangible equity
reached, as I mentioned before, 13.5%, up 3 percentage points year-on-year. All in all, we remain on track to
meet our targets for the year.
Our performance in Europe stood out not only for these positive set of results but also for the special initiatives
implemented to support our Ukrainian customers and employees, as well as refugees and all those affected by
the war. In this regard, we provided financial measures to facilitate transfers and cash withdrawals, made
donations, and collaborated with NGOs to help refugees such as the two planes chartered from Warsaw to
Portugal and Spain.
Going into details in Spain and in the UK, In Spain we increased the customer base by 200,000 customers in the
first quarter, which obviously helped volumes especially new mortgage lending, which doubled compared with the
first quarter of 2021 and exceeded pre-pandemic levels in consumer credit. Profit grew 21% year-on-year
supported by the execution of our efficiency plans and the lower cost of credit.
Revenue remained under pressure due to ALCO sales in 2021 and the change in mix. We had a much better
performance in fee income. The quarter-on-quarter comparison is benefited from, obviously, the Deposit
Guarantee Fund charges of the fourth quarter, but also supported by lower cost and loan loss provisions.
In the UK, we maintained very positive business dynamics. Gross mortgage lending rose to £9.5 billion in the first
quarter, near a record level. NII rose 15% supported by increased volumes and higher interest rates, which drove
double-digit growth in revenue. Fee income, it's – the comparison in fee income is negatively affected by the
transfer of the Corporate & Investment Bank activity from the bank to the London branch.
We double our efforts to keep costs under control and thus improved efficiency by 7 percentage points, which
enabled net operating income to grow 3%. Loan loss provisions were higher following the cost – the normalization
of the cost of credit. We would expect cost of credit to be around 10 basis points, and quarter-on-quarter
comparison was affected by the loan loss provision releases in the fourth quarter.
Moving to North America, our strategy there is to accelerate profitable growth in the US while creating a joint
value proposition to improve customer experience, simplifying our business to generate efficiencies. The
acquisition of Santander Consumer US (sic) [Santander Consumer USA] (00:22:17) outstanding shares along
with Amherst Pierpont Securities and Crédit Agricole's LatAm wealth management operations will improve our
strategic focus and competitive position. We had solid growth in individuals and commercial loans in Mexico and
increases in auto and CIB in the US.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
On a like-for-like basis, we need to exclude Bluestem portfolio disposal. In the first half of 2021, profit was 4%
higher, benefiting from a better NII and the acquisition of minorities in SCUSA. In the quarter, we virtually doubled
the average profit recorded before the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the US, we continue to make progress toward simplifying our business model across our four core businesses:
Consumer, Commercial, CIB and Wealth Management. Loans grew 8%, backed by CIB, auto and wealth
management. During the period, auto originations decreased impacted by the semiconductor shortage, pushing
the Manheim Value Index to an all-time highs in early 2022. Customer funds continue to exhibit strong
performance while the overall cost of funds decreased.
Moving to the P&L, on a like-for-like basis, profits dropped 5%, basically due to higher loan loss provisions driven
by normalization in the cost of credit. We also had a more normalized leasing activity due to an increase in the
share of lease-end vehicles repurchased at the dealership. In this quarter, in the first quarter of 2022, 94% were
purchased relative to 35% in the first quarter of 2021. NII was pressured by the run-off in Paycheck Protection
Program-related balances. All in all, we recorded a very high level of profit, more than doubling the quarter
average profit in 2019.
In Mexico, we had an excellent quarter, reflecting our successful customer attraction strategy. We delivered a
32% year-on-year increase in profit and also great returns, great profitability due to the increase in revenue
supported by NII, both due to higher volumes and the rise in interest rates and higher net income. We also had
lower loan loss provisions due to positive performance in our portfolio.
In South America, we continue to focus on attracting new customers, leveraging business opportunities,
strengthening connectivity and synergies across the region. We recorded overall growth in loans, with good
dynamics in individual lending in most countries. Deposits rose 6% driven by both demand and time deposits. In
terms of results, we grew profits 8% year-on-year with double-digit customer revenue growth. Costs, heavily
affected by inflation, especially in Brazil and Argentina, although cost, total costs were virtually flat in real terms;
higher provisions mainly driven by growth in individuals. Also in Brazil, we had lower taxes.
Moving to Brazil, we maintained positive trends in customer acquisition. Customer increased 12% year-on-year
and digital customers grew 18% year-on-year as we launched several initiatives for our multi-channel strategy. In
volumes, mortgages rose double digits, card turnover was up 22%, and we maintained our leadership in auto.
This great customer activity enable us to absorb the rising costs and higher provisions due to the growth we had
in individuals. Cost of risk stood at 3.94%.
In Chile, we continued to expand Santander Life, Superdigital and Getnet. We're very active in launching new
strategic initiatives. And as a result, we had very strong customer attraction with 11% growth year-on-year and we
maintain our top position in NPS, and we grew the balance sheet both in loans and deposits. In the P&L, very
positive performance year-on-year, up 28%, with revenues up 10%, cost growing below inflation, and a lower cost
of credit.
In the Digital Consumer Bank, also a solid quarter which reinforced our position. We are gaining market share
very quickly in Europe and we also signed new strategic alliances with Stellantis or Piaggio. We launched new
leasing businesses in all our markets in 2021, which experienced the 48% growth in new contracts year-on-year.
We launched the subscriptions, we signed an agreement with Wabi in subscriptions; and we launched Zinia, our
Buy Now, Pay Later solution in Germany, which has generated over 2.5 million new contracts in just 14 months.

Moreover, new business activity is now above pre-COVID levels having increased 17% year-on-year, up 13% in
new cars and 29% in used cars. We are increasing market share, as I mentioned, in both markets, new and used
cars. Openbank continue to grow strongly, both in balance sheet terms and number of customers, and obviously
this greater activity was reflected in fee income and lease and revenue growth.
Costs were up due to investment in global transformation platforms and some inorganic transactions. Excluding
these, cost increased 2%, more or less minus 2% in real terms. We also had very positive trends in credit quality
with a further 25 basis points reduction in the cost of credit. So, overall, again, very excellent results, very good
results in the quarter by the Digital Consumer Bank which increased 11%.
Turning to our global businesses, in Corporate & investment Bank, our goal is to become one of the leading
investment banks in Europe, consolidating our leadership in Latin America and continue to accelerate growth in
the US. Additionally, as leaders within the sustainable sphere, we completed in April 2022 our plan to acquire
80% of WayCarbon, a leading Brazil-based ESG consultancy firm.
In terms of financial performance, Q1 was the best quarter in CIB history with record revenue, attributable profit
and return on risk-weighted assets. Revenue was up 5% year-on-year, a very good quarter relative to already a
very good 2021, which led to a 10% increase in profit. It is worth noting that only 20% of our revenue come from
market-related activities, 80% comes from customers.
In Wealth Management, despite market volatility, our businesses grew, thanks to our globally-diversified, value-
added proposition and sales through digital channels. We were named as one of the Top 3 global Private Banks
by Euromoney and activity levels remained strong, with net new money around €3 billion in the quarter.
Investment flows and asset valuations were less impacted than in previous crises due to our global and high-
value-oriented asset mix. Contribution to the group rose 10%. In Insurance, we had sustainable growth based on
non-related business in addition to strong growth in digital sales, which were up 50% year-on-year. In summary,
higher revenue and total contribution to the group's profit in Wealth Management & Insurance achieved a 7%
growth, 14% up on a like-for-like basis.
Turning to PagoNxt, in the first quarter, we had several achievements in Merchant Acquiring, Getnet continue to
deliver very high growth, increasing total payments volume by 40%, backed by Brazil, one of our main growth
drivers; and Spain, thanks to our customer acquisition strategy and increased merchant activity, and also Mexico.
In International Trade, our One Trade platform currently connects our customers in eight countries. We continue
to expand its capabilities to provide international instant payments between Spain and Brazil. We plan to launch
real-time payments in other international corridors in the coming quarters. In summary, revenue doubled year-on-
year in the quarter. Obviously, quarter-on-quarter is affected by seasonality.
In Cards, I would like to highlight our efforts to improve our global card services. We are working to globally
manage 95 million cards through the group – throughout the group. In the first quarter of 2022, we continue to
grow strongly. Turnover and the number of transactions increased well above 20%. This performance was also
reflected in the first quarter revenue which reached almost €1 billion, 30% higher year-on-year. We had positive
performance in both credit, debit cards and across regions.
It is worth mentioning that revenue in the fourth quarter is seasonally higher, although in the fourth quarter we had
Black Friday and Christmas and still you see a very good comparison quarter-on-quarter, which shows how

strong the first quarter of 2022 was. Looking forward, we expect to continue to grow the number of accounts,
turnover and revenue.
Now, let me finish with the Corporate Centre. We reported an attributable loss of €460 million, which is relatively,
high affected by the negative FX hedging results, which obviously were more than offset by the positive
performance of exchange rates in the countries' results. The quarter was also impacted by the higher liquidity
buffer, and we also recorded a negative tax impact due to the higher results of those businesses operating in
Spain. On the other hand, we recorded no material changes in costs and we had a significant decrease in loan
loss provisions and other provisions.
And now let me turn it back to the CEO for his final remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, José. Just to finish this presentation and before we go to the question, let me share with you the
outlook for the coming quarters, taking into account the situation in which we are developing our business. As a
result of the geopolitical situation, we are facing an environment in which we – the consensus is shifting towards
an environment of lower growth than otherwise will be the case as a result of this war and in a – I mentioned
before, in a high inflationary environment that is triggering the reaction of the central banks increasing in the rates.
In some countries and some others, the market is expecting those to be increased.
So, taking into account all of these, I should say a couple of things. Our starting point is extremely solid. You see
the results, you see the trends and our activity in the business, you see our customer gathering, so the starting
point is very solid and we face this environment from a strong position. So our capacity to attract the customers
and growing more profitable business in a high – higher interest rate scenario is going to provide a big, significant
uplift to our revenues.
Naturally, in this inflationary environment, we need to be, as always, looking at matching the cost. We think that
we can continue to deliver a cost growth well below inflation as we showed you in the first quarter. Third, our
capacity to control the cost of risk and to keep it below the average across the cycle based on our customer
knowledge and our anticipation in some markets as we are doing in some markets make me comfortable with the
guidance we gave to you in the cost of risk, and our capital allocation strategy should continue to drive profitability
improvement and maximize shareholder returns.
This make us confident. We shared with you in our AGM that we are in the right track to achieve our 2022 targets
that we shared with you, both in revenues, efficiency, return on tangible equity and capital. So, now, we leave it
here and we remain at your disposals for the questions you may have. Thank you.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Everyone, your question-and-answer session will now begin. [Operator Instructions] And our first
question is coming from Ignacio Cerezo from UBS. You are now live.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Cerezo Q
Analyst, UBS AG (London Branch)
Yeah, hi. Two things from me. The first one is on Brazil, it looks like the situation has kind of deteriorated versus
the guidance you gave back in December. Probably, most of the lines are probably below expectations then, so if
you can update how you're expecting basically 2022 to be shaping up on the main lines in Brazil.
And the second one is any information you can provide on the process of Banamex in Mexico; interest, timing,
any information, actually incremental information versus the one you shared a few months ago? Thank you very
much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Thank you, Ignacio, for your questions. Let me – to elaborate in Brazil, I should say first that our
expectations are not materially different than the ones we had in the last quarter. Let me – to share with you
where are we in Brazil, so as you know, we tightened our credit standards back in September last year. As a
result, we are growing our portfolio less. But we, for the whole year, I feel comfortable growing the portfolio, in line
with the inflation, so more or less in line with inflation in the country, so around 10%, a bit less, a bit more. So, this
is our expectation.
Our – there is significant customer spread expansion in the business. So the spread, customer spread went up
more than 100 basis points. It's true that on the other side this was more than offset by the ALCO positions that,
well, on the back of increasing rates, almost 10 full percentage points. Naturally, the NII and the NIM coming from
ALCO positions collapsed. And this is what you see – the combination of this is what you see in the NII.
So, on – revenue-wise, on the net interest income, I feel that we can grow high single digits, no problems to get
there. And the same can be say, even more optimistic on fee income that we can be for the whole year in double
digit. The quarter show some seasonality here. The costs, have been difficult to control costs. As I mentioned, the
agreement with the unions back in September increased the salaries 11%. And what – we are showing the P&L
exactly this. Probably in the second, third quarter, we're going to – this is going to trend down, the cost growth,
and we will see the agreement with the unions in September. But I feel that we – going to be able to match to get
around inflation for the whole year.
Finally, you see – going through P&L, you see in the quarter an increase in the cost of risk that we were
anticipating. And while we went from 3.75% or a figure like that to something [ph] above (00:39:06) 4%, I remain
confident that we're going to match to be in the range between 4%, 4.5% for the whole year, yeah.
So that's my view. This [indiscernible] (00:39:19) environment in which we're going to continue to deliver good
results from Brazil and growing probably nicely in the country, and having a return on tangible equity north of 20%
or around 20% and not particular deterioration in this regard in this, I should say, more complex environment.
Although I should say also that the war in [ph] Ukrainia (00:39:46), well, when I look at Brazil, should be neutral to
positive for Brazil. So, I'm not as pessimistic as you seem to be about the trends in Brazil, yeah.

So, on second question, Banamex, well, [indiscernible] (00:40:03), yeah, to this, yeah? So, we said we – our
Chairman said the conditions, our requirements for participating. Well, we will not participate in the analysis of the
deal. You know our conditions, but nothing – I cannot at this time because we're having – we don't have additional
information other than the one that is public information, and the process has not officially started as far as I know.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sofie Peterzens Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Thank you. Here is Sofie from JPMorgan. So, my first question would be if you could just kind of remind us of your
auto partner agreements. How should we think about the Chrysler Fiat (sic) [Fiat Chrysler] (00:41:11) agreement
that comes to an end next year and could you just remind us what your new agreements in the US are?
You also have some new agreements in the – in Europe so could you just remind us what the potential impacts
from these agreements in Europe are? And related to that, if you could also talk about the US cost of risk because
it remains very low, below 50 basis points. So how should we think about a normalized cost of risk level in the US
and when do you expect loan losses in the US to normalize?
And then my second question would go back to Brazil. In terms of asset quality, we're starting to see some signs
of, kind of higher cost of risk but also higher NPL ratios in in Brazil. And NPL was 5.7% and at the same time,
coverage fell to 101%, so how should we think about the asset quality outlook in Brazil? How concerned are you
about the potential credit bubble given that rates have gone up so much? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Thank you, Sofie, for your questions, the first one related with Stellantis, our agreement with Stellantis. As
you know, first thing I should say, we have an excellent relationship with Stellantis. And we reached an agreement
in Europe, very satisfactory agreement, I should say, for us. As a result of this agreement, we're going to focus in
the main markets of Stellantis in Europe; France, Italy and Spain. As a result of the agreement, our portfolio with
Stellantis in Europe is going to grow.
I don't remember exactly the number, a couple of billions, €4 billion, €5 billion. The total portfolio is €30 billion or
€30 billion-something. We're going to have extra €4 billion, €5 billion as a result of this agreement that we reached
with them Europe. When it comes to the US, as you know, Stellantis Chrysler bought an small finance company
and they plan to develop this company. While this company is fairly small, as a result of this, we're going to
continue to be the preferred provider [ph] for (00:43:22) a while. How long it will last depends on the – how fast
the other company evolves.
Having said that, we feel that we're going to continue to underwrite significant – having significant originations on
Chrysler Stellantis in the US as long as with other originators. We reached an agreement with Mitsubishi, we'll
become the provider of Mitsubishi. We have agreements with certain dealers, with certain originators in the online
space, and I do feel comfortable in the – that we're going to continue to have the core, traditional core subprime

business we underwrite in our own. In the near prime and prime space, I think that the origination level is going to
remain relatively stable. At least in the US provider, the car market evolves in a – recovers the activity levels.
So, I'm pleased with the developments in this front and the agreements with Stellantis Chrysler. You mentioned
the cost of risk in US and Europe. It's true that in Europe, on the back of very low unemployment levels, the cost
of risk, good price of the used car – in the used car markets, the cost of risk is at the – one of the lowest levels,
we are not seeing any particular development here.
So, if I – I will focus more on – the main KPI here is, to me, is unemployment rate, yeah? So, as long as
unemployment rate remains as low as it is today and the trends in the labor market's solid, I feel comfortable with
the current cost of risk and even can stay here or even go lower on the back of this.
In the US, it's different. In the US, we are going back to more normalized level, you see in the trends, and this
trend will continue to go on. José already refers to the special situation of the used car markets in the US. That
has changed a little bit the dynamics in the sense that when the leases expire, the lessors prefer to keep the car
instead of giving us back and selling us to the market.
And this has changed a bit the dynamics in our P&L, at the – the Other income in the P&L, that's reduced as a
result of not making gains in disposal of the leases just because the lessors prefer to keep the cars and dispose
by themselves. But the cost of risk is going to get more normalized over time.
Brazil, you elaborate – I already – to the previous – Ignacio's questions, I elaborate on the cost of risk. You
mentioned higher NPL ratios, the coverage [ph] forward (00:46:27) outlook and the potential. Well, I said that my
best guess now based on the information I got is to have a cost of risk in the region of 4% to 4.5%, yeah? So,
probably two or – quarters more, three quarters more before we come back, but this is my best estimation here.
Well, this is the result of, as you rightly pointed out, of a significant decrease in the disposable income combined
with higher rates. Nothing that we were not expecting, and that advised us to reduce our [ph] speed (00:47:14) in
the consumer lending in the fourth quarter last year, and in the first quarter we get the same position. I hope I
answered all your questions. Thank you.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
Q
Yes, hi. Yes, I have two questions, on one side on lending growth outlook in Spain. I mean performance in the
quarter has been strong, if you could just update a bit us on the outlook for the Spanish NII and the rate sensitivity
domestically. And also, yes, I have another question on the cost side. If you just could elaborate a bit on what
were the changes in perimeter or the initiatives that you are pushing in the Digital Consumer Bank? What should
we expect going forward?
If I just may, one – I mean it's very early probably, but if you could just give a bit of a sense of what should we
expect of the impact in Poland from the measures announced yesterday by the prime minister? It would be very
useful. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay, [ph] Ignacio (00:48:36), the third question, I got the information yesterday. Probably it's a bit early, yeah, so
I – I'm sorry, I can't elaborate more on this space. Probably in the coming days or weeks once we know more, our
IR department will be – we will be more than happy to share with you our views. But now it's a bit early. Naturally,
the trends, it sounds definitively not positive for the banking system, but difficult to say at this stage and to guide
you with any impact.
On the other side, you've seen the results in the franchise that – our stellar results and, well, I do expect that
these measures, potential measures that come will not harm significantly this net income generation. But we'll
see, we'll see. We'll come back to you on this.
Lending growth in Spain, NII sensitivity, well, lending growth, Spain mortgage market has been quite strong in the
last two quarters or in the last three quarters, and this is the – this has been one of the main drivers. The other
driver is in – more in the CIB space, where on the back of – I were referring renewal energy, I were referring also
the energy sector where we are – we've been pretty active on, the lending growth that you see there comes from
particularly these two spaces, mortgages and the other side, CIB. In the middle market, [ph] SEBs (00:50:15), we
haven't seen a strong activity there.
NII, José will elaborate, but it's north of €1 billion sensitivity. José, will you want to elaborate on this?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Yeah, the sensitivity, we have two rates right now in the group, is in Europe, Continental Europe is around €1
billion, [ph] 200 (00:50:35) basis points parallel shift in the interest rate curve; approximately €250 million in the
UK and €200 million in the US. In South America, after having raised rates earlier, we are approaching the point
of neutrality already probably in the second half and should be positive in next – next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Finally, your question, [ph] Ignacio (00:51:09), if I get right, was about the Consumer Bank, you mentioned
the perimeter. Well, what we've done last year, we bought a company, leasing company in Germany along with
Hyundai, a joint venture, 50/50 we bought from the market. And the other developments we have is we entered in
a business in Greece, with the main importer of cars in Greece and we are developing this business. And also,

other minors was mentioned by José in the presentation, the agreements with Piaggio and others that, well, you
can say this is business as usual, yes, somehow, at the same time means that we are changing the perimeter is a
way to grow the business.

Operator: Our next question is coming from Carlos Peixoto from CaixaBank BPI. You're now live.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos Peixoto Q
Analyst, CaixaBank BPI
Hi, good morning. Carlos Peixoto from CaixaBank. How are you? So, first question would actually be on the
outlook for cost of risk in Spain. I believe that the fourth quarter you have guided to roughly 50 basis points for the
full year where the first quarter is around 60 basis points, yeah, [ph] in my mind, in my math (00:52:36). I was
wondering if you'd keep the guidance for the full year or if it changes in – with the war in Ukraine and rising energy
prices will mean some changes on that front.
Then on the second question regarding capital, I was wondering if you could give us some color on the pending
regulatory impact that you see for 2022 and if there are any in 2023. And on a related question, I was – what
would be the – currently the minimum level that you would be willing to see [indiscernible] (00:53:13) going down
to in the context of an acquisition, let's say, Banamex acquisition obviously? Perhaps some reference there.
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Thank you, Carlos. Outlook for cost of risk in Spain, we got you in the region of 50 basis points. We – -
basically, I – if I remember well, we said we're going to have the cost of risk of last year that was 97 or close to
100 basis points. I remain comfortable with this guidance, yeah? Even in the newest scenario, I don't think that
this is – scenario is going to affect materially our expectation for the cost of risk in Spain.
It's true that we're going to have the expiration of the extensions in [indiscernible] (00:54:01) now starting in April,
the same month, and we'll – I've being talking to you many times about some uncertainties surrounding this. And
there's still some uncertainty, how the – those customers are going to behave. Having said that, the risk we have
here is only 25% of the outstanding volumes and is not going to change materially our outlook, the cost of risk for
the whole year.
In capital, I would leave José to elaborate on the regulatory impact that will come. Let me to elaborate on – you're
asking for a minimal level. We don't have a minimum level stated as we have a target to be 12%, to be at 12%
and we – this is our target but we don't have as such as a minimum level. You're asking for Banamex. I should
state again, as we stated the last time, the question that – I think was [ph] Ignacio (00:54:56) made the question
about Banamex, I said what we say remains and – in – what we said does – was that we do not plan to issue
shares potentially to buy Banamex, not in the parent company or in the subsidiary in Mexico, and this remains,
yeah? So the conditions we established to potentially buy Banamex remains in place, including not issuing
shares.
And, José, do you want to elaborate on regulatory capital...

Yeah, in terms of regulatory chargers and models this year, same estimation we mentioned in the previous
quarter, 20 to 25 basis points this year, more or less. For 2023, we wouldn't expect any significant amount,

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Pamela Zuluaga Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd.
Hello, good morning. This is Pamela. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I first want to ask a follow-up.
If you were to be interested in acquiring Citibanamex, again, quoting you, without the possibility of issuing capital,
you would need to rely on organic capital generation. So could such an interest potentially change the payout
targets that you have currently or would any shortfall in the required funding come from any potential divestitures?
And then, if I may, some questions, one, around the cost of risk. The cost of risk for the quarter was still quite
below the guidance for the year even without allocating the COVID overlay, which I understand was the case.
Have you had any updates so far to your IFRS models or are you waiting to see how the macro continues
developing? So, do you anticipate a pickup in provisions later in the year or could another potential release in
provisions offer upside to the cost of risk guidance for this year?
Around Spain, kind of in line with what Carlos was talking about but more from the loan growth perspective, do
you see the mix – how do you see the mix evolving? Do you see the extension of the ICO guarantees kind of

revitalizing the Corporate segment this year? How is the high inflation amid rising energy prices in the country
impacting the consumer book? Have you seen any weaknesses there so far?
And I'm sorry, if I may, one last one. I was looking at the interest rate sensitivity that you were giving for Europe.
It's now lower than what was disclosed at the end of 2021. Can you maybe give us some color on this change?
Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Thank you, Pamela. Let me to go with your questions. Well, your first question was in relation with
Banamex, again, is this – may affect the buybacks and – well, the dividend policy for this year is public. It's the
intention of the board to continue with the payout of 40%, half in shares, half in buying back shares and half in
cash. So there is no intention to change this and – that's the question.
Organic capital generation, I'm fairly positive on this, yeah, so you see the quarter. And I do think that we will [ph]
not (00:58:52) keep growing. But taking into account return on tangible equity and risk-weighted assets growth
that in the quarter was in the region of 3%, if I remember well, probably we'll not going to keep growing. Risk-
weighted assets there, our capital generation, taking into account the payout policy, is going to be significant, our
capital accumulation is going to be significant. That's what I can tell you at this stage.
Cost of risk update, well, I mentioned to you the main changes. The main drivers were Brazil, where I do
elaborate the cost of risk is going to go [audio gap] (00:59:33-01:01:50). Okay. As you say that – well, in relation
with the interest rate sensitivity, when you come from negative in Europe like we are in Europe and you go into
positive territory, very likely, going from minus 5% to plus 0.5%, you're going to capture 100%, yeah, so on this
space, you're going to capture 100%.
Elasticity will change. I don't know if this is going to be 0.5% or 1%, beyond that. So, that makes sense, is as the
rate goes up at the beginning, sensitivity to rates is extremely high, is close to 1% and depending on the
utilization, but is very high. As you go by and the Central Bank is – keep increasing rates or the market keep
increasing rates, elasticity changes, and [ph] years (01:02:33) elasticity [ph] as (01:02:34) what José explained.
This is happening already in Poland, not yet in UK but may start relatively quickly in UK if the Bank of England
keep increasing rates and is far away in Europe where we need, well, 100 basis points official rate, at least to
start to change the sensitivity that at the beginning is extremely high, yeah?
So, this is how you should think on this, at least in our balance sheet that is extremely asset sensitive, as you
know, because the mortgages, because all the SME lending that tend [ph] to be sure on (01:03:05), and then to
be Euribor based for the CIB, in the CIB space and large corporate. So, highly sensitivity to rates, with elasticity
that keep changing along the increasing rates from the central banks.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
Alvaro Serrano Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
Hi. Good morning. I got two follow-up questions. Maybe one on Brazil and one on capital. José Antonio, I think on
Brazil, if I understood you correctly, I think you said high-single digit, NII growth, you still remain confident, given
the minus 6% quarter-on-quarter, that seems to imply that there's going to be sort of recovery, significant recovery
over the next few quarters. Can you sort of maybe confirm that I've heard correctly? And if that's correct, what
would be driving that rebound?
And on capital, again, a follow-up on some of your comments. I mean, Q1 to me at least, should have been the
most difficult quarter, given what the curves have done. And you've actually pulled off a pretty decent sort of
capital print is – with the slowing growth, you mentioned you're confident that you're going to continue to still grow.
If you – if Banamex doesn't happen and you end up, I don't know, [ph] €312.4 million (01:04:44) or whatever, at
the end of the year you might come up. Do you think from your discussions in the board or from management
thinking, what would you do with our capital? Would you – [ph] is your preference (01:04:59) would be to keep the
extra buffer to distribute it, maybe normalizing sort of payout [indiscernible] (01:05:08) or do you see you can grow
into it or M&A? Just sort of some thoughts there. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Thank you, Alvaro. Let me to elaborate again in Brazil. Yeah. So, why I do see this trend, I mentioned to
you the dynamics in the balance sheet. You have on one side, customer spread that went up from around 10%
one year ago to 11%, I don't know, 30% or [ph] 11%, 40% (01:05:37) or something like that in the first quarter this
year.
And on the other side, you have the ALCO portfolio that last year was producing revenues of around €3 billion
and now is close to zero. So, if you take into account the two dynamics. One is customers, the other is the ALCO
is what allowed me to be – to give you the guidance I gave to you. So, you put these dynamics forward and you
seek how much the rates can increase from where we are and how much the customers that can – the revenues
coming from customers can increase based on the spreads. You get dynamics that in line with what I mentioned
to you before. I hope it helps you to project the numbers with these ideas.
Second, capital, while you say pretty decent, it's more than pretty decent. Yeah. So, this seems to me a bit
downbeat. Yeah. It's very good capital generation. And while this is on the back of good results and, well, growth,
we keep growing and well, probably, we've been telling you that we – our ALCO portfolios were non-existent in
some [indiscernible] (01:07:00) what I've seen in many banks is the available for sale portfolio impacting strongly
the capital. And in our case, our position, well, in Europe, is non-existent and in other markets, at least I think, is
more than other banks based on the impact I've seen in the capital base.
Going forward, we're going to keep generating capital in line with the guidance we gave you. And José already
elaborate on the potential regulatory impacts that, well, for this year and expectation next year, [ph] not regulatory
impacts (01:07:44).
Discussion at the board, well, it's also transparent. Yeah. So, the board said that we established the intention of
paying 40% payout, half insurance, half in cash, and intention to go to the 50%. Okay. So, this is up to the board.
Naturally, this is not only up to me. But the further discussion I will expect, if you ask me, in the board, is when
we're going to – from 40% to 50%, well, this is the first step I will expect the board to take. And as I said, it is up to
the board to discuss probably two quarters from now, is when the discussion need to take place.

Good morning. Back again on capital, sorry, but it's a clarification. You're now targeting 12% CET1, you
maintained that. But what will be the plan to maintain this if Banamex came along, you don't want to issue shares
at the parent or at a subsidiary level. Is the 12% target, a hard target or could you compromise on it in the case of
Banamex?
Second question is just a kind of yes or no. Should we expect an IFRS 9 charge in Q2 given the poorer
macroeconomic scenario? If you could elaborate please on your ALCO strategy and if you have already included
that evolution in your guidance or if you have upside from that. And just finally, a very quick one, Brazil, what's
happened to taxes this quarter and is the NPL increase we have in the quarter just due to the new definition of
default or is it a genuine change? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. On capital, well, [indiscernible] (01:10:02), our target is 12% and remains at 12% and this is the target that
the board established. Naturally, the moving parts here are the growth we're going to achieve that in the current
scenario activity levels, in line with a less growth in the world, probably will be a bit – we expect to keep growing
probably less so than otherwise would be the case. And what we plan to do with this is too speculative. You're
asking – third question if something happens, what happens afterwards, difficult to elaborate on this, but, well, we
have the tools, the tools to match our capital.
We can [indiscernible] (01:10:49), we can dispose assets, We can do many things, okay? So, we have the
commitments that we have which is the payout with shareholders, not to issue shares. Those are the
commitments that we have, and an intention going forward when – [ph] advise (01:11:02) to go for a higher
payout ratio. This is our stance on capital and I can't elaborate more on this.
Second question, IFRS 9 charge, we don't expect material charge there. Naturally, we need to apply the new
macro scenario, but we do not expect any material charge and that changed our outlook for the cost of risk.
In Brazil, taxes, well, plenty of moving parts there. The main one is the – what they call [ph] ECB (01:11:29).
When they pay dividends on their own funds or something like that euros [indiscernible] (01:11:41). I don't know
how – interest over own equity or something like that. When this happens, they pay a dividend that is free of taxes
and this affect your review the last couple of years. You have this quarter-on-quarter. Nothing special this year.
Sometimes it happens from one quarter, sometimes it happens in a different quarter. And in this particular
quarter, you reduce what is called the [ph] ECB (01:12:10) in Brazil.
NPLs, naturally new definition on default affect NPLs everywhere including Brazil. I don't have in my mind.
Probably, IR can give you how much is the impact of the new definition on default in Brazil in the NPLs. I gave
you for the group that was, see if I remember well, 19 basis points [indiscernible] (01:12:35) 19 basis points in the
NPL, so I don't know how much this was in Brazil, but we'll provide you with this number for Brazil.

Thank you. And thank you, Andrea. Can we have the next question, please?

Operator: Our next question is coming from Francisco Riquel from Alantra. You are now live.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Francisco Riquel Q
Analyst, Alantra Equities Sociedad de Valores SA
Yes. Hello. Most of my questions have been answered. Just wanted to ask on the UK business. The mortgage
volumes are stronger than we thought, but I understand that the spreads for new lending are also very low. If you
can update on the front book, back book dynamics and on NII guidance and – in the UK and overall in the
profitability of the new mortgage business? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Thank you, Francisco, for your question. UK, well, as you see the NII has been evolving in a positive way in
the last couple of quarters, on the back of volumes, mortgage volumes, good spreads. When rates start to go up
and the translation of this increase in the swap rates into the mortgage, the new origination in mortgages produce
some attrition in the NIM of the new mortgages.
Having said that, overall, we do expect continue – the good news to continue on the NII. We expect to continue to
grow NII in the UK, while mid – low-mid-single digits probably we continue to expect to grow in this line. So, we
are not positive.
On top of this, you have the changes in rates naturally. Okay. So that – while you have the sensitivity to rates, that
is starting to show up. Yeah. So, the first inclusion rates was, if I remember well in December, it takes two month,
more or less, till this goes into the P&L. So, we saw another increase in rates that is going to show up. So, we will
see what probably is not yet well known is what is going to happen on the liability side in the UK in a ecosystem
where there are plenty of new players that may affect the traditional elasticity on the liability side. Yeah. So, this is
a – it has to be transparent – 100% transparent [ph] with you (01:15:16) this is unknown at this stage.
The market – some market participants fear that we're going to have immediately very aggressive players on the
back of higher rates. We will see if this happen. If it doesn't happen, this may change a bit the outlook for this. But
in general, I feel constructive we're going to keep growing there with flat costs. So, operationally, we're going to
have a very good trends in the UK.

Carlos Cobo Catena Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (Spain)
Hi. Hi. Thank you very much for the presentation. And yes, most of my question has been answered, but I have a
couple of follow ups on cost of risk. The cost of risk this quarter, it's around 80 to 85 basis points I remember. That

still remains below your 90 basis point guidance for the full year and also you kind of revised that slightly higher
after the conflict in Ukraine.
So, shall we expect a gradual increase in the cost of risk driven by that higher loan losses expectations in Brazil?
Is that the main driver or are there other moving parts that should [ph] come back (01:16:46) to the 90, 95 basis
points guidance? And that guidance is my own words. You haven't really provided that specific target. And the
other one, have you used the provision overlay this quarter and how much is left? Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
So, the cost of risk, we're going to be approaching the 100 basis points. I think we're going to remain below of this
is what we've said. We're going to be below expected across the cycle using the [indiscernible] (01:17:21) of 1%.
This is our guidance in the cost of risk. I elaborated the markets in which we expect changes, US trending up,
Brazil trending up, I already elaborate on this, and Spain trending down. Those are the main moving parts that
explain this expectation for the cost of risk.
You see the provision overlay. We haven't used that much. So, they are telling me that less than €100 million here
and there. So, not material in this quarter. Yeah. So – but remember that when we run the IFRS 9, we would need
to necessarily update where we're going to head into based on unexpected the losses used in the new macro.
Yeah. But as I said before, we do not expect a big deal in this [ph] exercise at least the macro scenario change
(01:18:18).

Operator: Next question is coming from Daragh Quinn from KBW. You're now live.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daragh Quinn Q
Analyst, KBW
Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. First question, on the valuation adjustments or other
comprehensive income which improved in the quarter I think by about €1.7 billion so improving on – in equity but
then was just curious as to why that didn't translate into an improvement in capital where there was a negative
impact from market valuations. Maybe you could just provide a little bit more color around the moving parts of FX
bond portfolios, etcetera, and how they impacted capital in the quarter.
And then second question on Spanish revenues. Firstly, on fees, which delivered very good growth this quarter
relative to maybe some of the seasonality we would normally expect in Q1 versus Q4. So just if you could provide
a little bit of color of what you're doing that is growing the fee business and is that a sustainable level of growth for
the remainder of the year? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
[ph] So the valuation (01:19:45) is due to the effects, yeah? So the changes in the – we go back to you and
explain where the changes were, but the main driver here, as I mentioned at the beginning, the FX play a
significant role and this affect naturally the tangible net asset value per share because these affect the equity and
this valuation is due to the FX. As you know, the euro depreciate almost against every currency in which we work

and this has had the impact you mentioned. But you need more elaboration and specific details on it, happy to do
that through our IR department.
Fees, you mentioned the seasonality, Q4, Q1 and you mentioned also that Q1 was better than you were
expecting. Well, the fee income was better than expected due to transactionality levels that grew significantly and
CIB business. Yeah. You saw CIB business when José was presenting the results. The corporate investment
banking activity, our fee income is growing very nicely. Our business is gathering traction. It has been gathering
traction for a couple of years.
And our fee business, our CIB business did very well. Also, I should mention the Wealth Management and Asset
Management business that they are growing double-digit. But not as – the growth is [ph] less so down (01:21:18)
in CIB. CIB quarter-on-quarter results went up 78% and partially was due to the good fee income generation. And
also this applies to Wealth Management and Asset Management that performed very well in the quarter and this
is on the back of the good fee income generation that we got.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
And with regards to the available for sale impact on capital in the quarter, it was [ph] 78 basis points (01:21:47).
So the ALCO portfolio impact on capital was [ph] 78 basis points (01:21:53).

Operator: Our next question is coming from Britta Schmidt from Autonomous Research. You are now live.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Britta Schmidt Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Yeah. Hi, there. Thanks for taking my question. Just coming back to the rates theme with 12-month Euribor
already having moved, what sort of impact do you expect in Spain for 2022? And when will we start seeing that?
And maybe you can give us a rundown of what rate expectations you have incorporated in your planning for the
UK, Brazil, US, the 12 months Euribor and maybe Mexico as well. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. We'll provide information on this. Yeah. In Spain, the Euribor, let me to speak in my memory, our mortgage
book that is the one, Euribor to amount affect like €80 billion of our portfolio in Spain. Yeah. So, it takes two
month, three month before when the Euribor – we applied the Euribor of April to the renewals in June. Okay. And
these affect to [indiscernible] (01:23:12) along the year. Yeah. So, [ph] 112 (01:23:15) amount is a fairest answer
and €6 billion or something like that. Yeah.
So, this is the sensitivity of Euribor, more in Euribor three months. So, [ph] you're not (01:23:29) going to see this
effect, the Euribor three month start to go up and this depends on when the renewal, but it's another €70 million,
€80 billion in companies more or less related with Euribor. This is to give you a sense of the asset sensitivity in
the Spanish book.

You mentioned also other countries. We provide you with the data. We are geared toward high rates in Mexico
clearly, in UK, Europe [ph] and the euro area (01:24:02) including Poland is a bit negative in Brazil, and we are
seeing that already. And Chile is much more difficult because we have a trade between inflation and nominal
rates that is much a bit more complex. Yeah. So, depends on what happens with [indiscernible] (01:24:23)
inflation is fairly volatile, but in general, one thing to offset the other, but in specific quarters, maybe you're going
in a way, another way in another quarter. Yeah.
So, you have something to add, José? No. Okay.

Fernando Gil de Santivanes Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I have just one question on the ALCO portfolio. I see that the size has gone
up by €9 billion this quarter. I was wondering if you can update the strategy among the European part of this
portfolio. When do you expect this to go up and how far can you go up and if this is included in your forecasted
outlook that you have provided? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
We don't have euro portfolio at this stage. We have, I think, €2 billion in Portugal. Yeah. So, it's very minor. Yeah.
Nothing in Spain. And in our forecasting, we are not counting in any ALCO portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
And again, José Antonio already referred to this, we did an increase the ALCO portfolio size in any country in the
quarter. The increase in euro terms is because of the exchange rate.

Benjie Creelan-Sandford Q
Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.
Yeah. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Two quick questions on lending and revenue
growth outlook. First of all, in Brazil, it looks like you are continuing to grow below the system. I was just
wondering whether you expect to kind of remain more restrictive versus the market through the rest of this year
and whether you're aiming to change the mix of the book in Brazil going forward.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2022
And the second was on the European Consumer business. You've obviously talked about the inorganic
opportunities. You've also talked about unemployment been a very important lead indicator for risk in the
Consumer business. But perhaps from a revenue and a loan growth outlook leaving aside the inorganic
opportunities given the inflationary pressures, etcetera, what are you seeing in terms of customer demand levels
at this point in time? How do you expect that to trend through the rest of this year? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Lending in Brazil, you're elaborating in relation with our lending standards, we're going to remain where we
are as long as – till the point we see stabilization in the risk premium. Yeah. So, if we are right, we expect the next
two quarters to have stabilization in the risk premium. If that were the case, we may become more confident to
start to grow strongly against, maybe, in the last part of the year. But this is I'm sharing with you my expectation.
We need to look at the data. We need to look at the vintages, how the vintages coming and how do they behave
till we change our stance towards our lending – consumer lending in Brazil.
The other questions, Santander Consumer Finance in Europe, aside from inorganic opportunities, well, this is a
business that I mentioned before that were inorganic, I don't know how do you deem opportunities when we are
take new OEM to our portfolio, you may deem as inorganic or organic. What I can tell you is very likely this
continues to happen. Yeah. So we are gaining significant share and we are a partner of choice for many OEMs
that are willing to expand into Europe, and very likely we're going to capture opportunities there.
Aside from that, that you may [indiscernible] (01:28:32) organic or inorganic that some other. How do we see the
customer demand? Well, as you know, there's scarcity in new cars. The supply is weak. We are seeing this in the
stock finance. Our stock finance normally in Europe stays at €5 billion with the car dealers now stays one-third of
this or less. This tell you about the situation of the supply/demand dynamics in the industry. This is for new cars.
So that is what restrict the volumes there, the remuneration is more supply and demand.
When we go to used cars, the opposite is happening, yeah? So prices went up and demand is – the prices went
up due to the strong demand there and our remuneration has been pretty strong. If you look at the quarter, our
remuneration in auto lending in Europe was grew more than 10%, yeah? When the market for new cars
decreased a bit, okay, this tell you, we are gaining share, that's for sure. And at the same time, we – our position
in the used car market is pretty strong in the main markets, particularly in Germany, but not only in Germany, but
particularly in Germany. Those are the dynamics that we are seeing.
And I do see the opportunity overall the business is going to grow, the volumes. The speed at which we grow
depends on how many agreements we reach with OEMs, car dealers, associations, importers, Chinese OEMs
that are coming to Europe. This is a plenty of moving parts there, but I remain on the back of our recognition as
the leader in the market and the best operator in the market that is widely recognized. I do expect us to keep
going and to gain market share in this, through a combination of traditional origination, new agreements and all
these things, yeah. So, that's my expectation. I hope I answered your question, yeah.
