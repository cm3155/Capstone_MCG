Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Fifth Third Bancorp Second
Quarter 2021 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers'
presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Chris Doll, Director of Investor Relations.
Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.

Chris Doll
Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations, Fifth Third Bancorp
Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today we'll be discussing our financial results
for the second quarter of 2021. Please review the cautionary statements in our materials which can be found in
our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain reconciliations to non-GAAP measures as well as
information pertaining to the use of non-GAAP measures, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth
Third's performance. We undertake no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of
this call.
This morning, I'm joined by our CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Jamie Leonard; President, Tim Spence; and Chief
Credit Officer, Richard Stein. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Jamie, we will open the call for questions.
Let me turn the call over to Greg now for his comments.

Gregory D. Carmichael
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported second quarter net
income of $709 million or $0.94 per share. On adjusted basis, we earned $0.98 per share. Once again, our
financial results were very strong, continuing the positive momentum from the past several quarters. During the
quarter, we generated sequential PPNR growth of 15% on an adjusted basis. The growth was 6% compared to
the year-ago quarter.
Commercial loan production increased 10% from last quarter with strength in middle market across our footprint
as well as in corporate banking. We generated strong consumer household growth of 4% compared to last year,
and we also experienced historically low net charge-offs of 16 basis points, reflecting improvement in both our
commercial and consumer portfolios.
We generated an adjusted ROTCE of nearly 20% for the second consecutive quarter, reflecting strong business
and credit results across the franchise. Our results were supported by our continued improvement in our
diversified businesses. In fact, we achieved record results in several of our fee-based businesses, including
commercial banking and wealth and asset management.
Despite continued pressure from low interest rates, net interest income increased 3% sequentially and the
underlying NIM increased 2 basis points. We believe that our disciplined approach to managing the balance
sheet, including in our securities and hedge portfolios, will continue to generate differentiated performance relative
to peers.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
We also continue to maintain our expense discipline while still investing for long-term outperformance. As a result
of our strong revenue growth combined with our expense management, we generated positive operating leverage
on a year-over-year basis with an adjusted efficiency ratio of 58%. We are prioritizing investments that drive
further operational efficiencies to improve our resiliency, generate household growth and improve the customer
experience.
To that end, we recently announced an expanded partnership with FIS to modernize our core deposit and wealth
systems to the cloud, which will enable us to further our digital transformation. This will significantly improve the
flexibility and scalability of our technology infrastructure and accelerate our speed to market. Combining this
agreement, with the renegotiation of our existing payment processing relationship, allows us to modernize our
platforms while maintaining an efficient overall cost structure.
From a commercial standpoint, loan production this quarter was the highest since before the pandemic, with
significant sequential improvements in technology, renewable energy and manufacturing. However, our strong
production was once again offset by elevated pay-downs and PPP forgiveness. While we continue to retain the
customer in their core banking relationship, loan growth remains muted due to the environment.
Our commercial lending production trends, pipelines and retention of the client relationship, all continue to support
the potential for improved loan growth once supply and labor constraints normalize. We currently expect our 31%
commercial revolver utilization rate to increase 1% by year-end.
On the consumer side, as I mentioned, we once again generated robust household growth. This strong
performance reflects our ability to acquire new customers combined with low attrition, both of which were
supported by our branch and digital investments. Our recent Southeast de novo branches have helped contribute
to our household growth.
On the digital side, we continue to leverage technology and data analytics to deliver solutions that improve the
customer experience, increase revenue and drive efficiencies. We have recently launched Fifth Third Momentum
Banking across our footprint, a banking value proposition unparalleled in our industry. Momentum combines the
best of a traditional bank offering with several leading fintech capabilities, including Early Pay which gives
customers free access to their paycheck up to two days early, Extra Time which allows customers to cure an
overdraft until midnight the following business day without a fee, MyAdvance which gives customers short-term
on-demand liquidity advances, smart savings, and other features all provided with no monthly fee.
Our strategy to keep the customer at the center has significantly reduced our reliance on punitive consumer
deposit fees, including overdrafts and ATM fees, where Fifth Third has been among the lowest compared to peers
for several years. Fifth Third Momentum Banking accelerates our efforts to help customers avoid unnecessary
fees.
As I mentioned during the quarter, we recorded a net benefit to credit losses, reflecting historically low net charge-
offs combined with a stronger economic outlook. Our strong credit performance reflects disciplined client
selection, conservative underwriting and continued support from fiscal and monetary government stimulus
programs. In addition to historically low credit losses, our criticized assets and NPAs once again improved this
quarter. Criticized assets declined another 16% and our NPA ratio declined 11 basis points sequentially.
Our balance sheet and earnings power remained very strong. Our CET1 ratio of 10.4% was relatively stable
compared to last quarter, despite share repurchases of $347 million in the second quarter. As we have said

before, we remain focused on deploying capital into organic growth opportunities, evaluating strategic non-bank
opportunities, dividend increases and share repurchases. Additionally, our capital position and earnings capacity
support an increase in our common dividend starting in the third quarter. We currently expect to request a $0.03
increase to our quarterly dividend in September, subject to board approval and economic conditions. We also
expect to execute share repurchases totaling approximately $850 million in the second half of 2021 and continue
to target a 9.5% CET1 by June 2022.
We recently announced the strategic acquisition of Provide, a fintech healthcare practice finance firm. Provide
focuses on the dental, veterinary, and vision segments, and delivers digital capabilities which support a best-in-
class experience and speed to close. Provide previously utilized an originate-to-sell model. As a result, the closing
of the acquisition will not include a transfer of loan balances. However, post close, Fifth Third will retain all loan
originations. We currently hold around $400 million in loans generated by Provide and have non-credit
relationships with over 70% of these borrowers through deposits and/or treasury management products. The
acquisition is expected to close in early August and will utilize approximately 20 basis points of capital.
In summary, we believe our balance sheet strength, diversified revenues and continued focus on discipline
throughout the company will serve us well this year and beyond. We remain committed to generate sustainable
long-term value and consistently producing top-quartile results.
I would once again like to thank our employees. I'm very proud of the way you have continually risen to the
occasion to support our customers. Our commitment to generate sustainable value for stakeholders is evident in
our second annual ESG report published in June. This expands on last year's report with increased transparency,
including enhanced disclosures on priority topics such as inclusion and diversity, our climate strategy, and our
commitment to fair and responsible banking. We remain guided by our purpose, vision and core values, and
expect to continue delivering strong results over the long-term.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jamie to discuss our second quarter results and our current outlook.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Thank you, Greg, and thank all of you for joining us today. We are very pleased with the financial results this
quarter, reflecting focused execution throughout the bank. Our quarterly results included solid revenue growth and
continued discipline on both expenses and credit. The reported results for the quarter included a $37 million
reduction in fee income for the negative mark related to the Visa total return swap.
Our improved business performance throughout the bank resulted in strong return metrics. We produced an
adjusted ROA of 1.43% and an adjusted ROTCE excluding AOCI of 19.7%. Our adjusted earnings per share
were a record for the Bancorp. We generated healthy PPNR results, the strongest since before the pandemic,
with net interest income growing 3% sequentially, continued success growing and diversifying noninterest income,
and diligent expense management.
Improvements in credit quality this quarter resulted in a $159 million release to our credit reserves, resulting in an
ACL ratio of 206 basis points compared to 219 basis points last quarter. With historically low charge-offs of just 16
basis points this quarter and an improved economic outlook, we recorded a $115 million net benefit to the
provision for credit losses.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
Moving to the income statement, net interest income increased $32 million sequentially, reflecting our ability to
effectively manage the balance sheet despite the environmental headwinds from low interest rates and elevated
pay-downs given capital market conditions.
Our NII growth was driven by average loan growth of 1% and $11 million of incremental prepayment penalty
benefits from our bullet and locked-out cash flow strategy in our investment portfolio, which that position remains
on 58% at quarter-end.
Our loan balances benefited from the additional $1 billion of Ginnie Mae forbearance loan buyout purchases in
early April, bringing the total third-party purchases to $3.7 billion. The other NII benefits were from a higher day
count and not replacing long-term debt maturities, partially offset by the impact of declining average commercial
loan balances and lower loan yields. PPP-related interest income was $53 million this quarter, unchanged relative
to the prior quarter.
On the liability side, we reduced our interest bearing core deposit cost by another 1 basis point this quarter to 5
basis points, and also had maturities of approximately $2.3 billion of long-term debt. With most deposit products
at or near their assumed floors, the remaining liability management benefits going forward will likely be limited to
CDs and reductions in long-term debt balances due to maturities.
Reported NIM increased 1 basis point compared to the prior quarter as the aforementioned investment portfolio,
long-term debt and Ginnie Mae loan buyout impacts were partially offset by the decline in commercial loan
balances and lower loan yields. Underlying NIM, excluding PPP and excess cash, increased 2 basis points to 312
basis points.
With a highly asset-sensitive balance sheet and over $30 billion in excess liquidity, we continue to be well-
positioned to benefit when interest rates rise, while also remaining well-hedged if rates remained low given our
securities portfolio and derivatives.
Total reported noninterest income decreased just 1% sequentially. Adjusted noninterest income increased 1%
driven by record commercial banking revenue with strength in loan syndications and financial risk management
products, solid card and processing revenue from higher credit and debit interchange revenue reflecting the
robust economic rebound, and an increase in both commercial and consumer deposit fees. These increases were
partially offset by sequential declines in mortgage and lease syndications.
Top line mortgage banking revenue decreased $8 million sequentially, reflecting incremental margin pressure.
Production was strong during the quarter in both the retail and correspondent channels, with second quarter
originations of $5 billion, up 7% sequentially.
Compared to the year-ago quarter, adjusted noninterest income increased 15% with strength in deposit service
charges, commercial banking revenue, wealth and asset management, and card and processing revenue,
reflecting both the underlying strength in our lines of business and the robust economic rebound over the past
year. The performance and resilience of our fee income levels over the past several quarters highlight the benefit
of the revenue diversification that we have achieved.
Noninterest expense decreased 5% compared to the first quarter, reflecting declines in compensation and
benefits expenses, lower card and processing expense due to contract renegotiations, and disciplined expense
management throughout the bank. This was partially offset by expenses linked to strong business performance as
well as servicing expenses associated with loan purchases and a $12 million mark-to-market impact from our

non-qualified deferred compensation plans which had a corresponding offset in security gain. For the full year, we
expect to incur around $50 million in third-party servicing expense for purchase loans.
Our compensation-related expense growth this year continues to be proportionate to the success we are seeing
in our fee-based businesses. On a year-over-year basis, total adjusted fees have increased 15% compared to 4%
expense growth. Additionally, compared to the pre-pandemic levels of the second quarter of 2019, total adjusted
fees have increased 14% compared to expense growth of just 3%.
Moving to the balance sheet, total average loans and leases were up 1% sequentially as consumer loan growth
was partially offset by a decline in commercial loans. Additionally, period end loans were up 1% excluding PPP.
Average total consumer loans increased 4%, as ongoing strength in the auto portfolio and the impact of Ginnie
Mae loans purchased were partially offset by declines in home equity and credit card balances, reflecting the
continued impacts of government stimulus.
Average commercial loans declined 1% compared to the prior quarter, largely driven by PPP forgiveness and
elevated payoffs, which were partially offset by strong production across most of our verticals and throughout our
middle market footprint. Production was up 10% compared to the prior quarter and up over 20% compared to the
pre-pandemic levels of the second quarter of 2019.
Excluding the impact of PPP, our end-of-period C&I loans were up slightly sequentially, as client sentiment and
business activities in several industries are showing signs of stabilization. Revolver utilization of 31% was flat
compared to the prior quarter, reflecting the market liquidity and capital markets conditions. We are encouraged
by the fact that we have successfully retained virtually all clients throughout the pandemic, which will enable us to
further deepen and grow these relationships going forward.
Average CRE loans were flat sequentially with end-of-period balances declining 3%. Our securities portfolio
increased 1% this quarter. We continue to reinvest portfolio cash flows, but we'll remain patient on deploying the
excess cash. We will continue to be opportunistic as the economic environment evolves.
Assuming no meaningful changes to our economic outlook, we would expect to increase our cash deployment
when investment yields move north of the 200-basis-point level. We remain optimistic that strong economic
growth in the second half of 2021 and an eventual Fed tapering of bond purchases will present more attractive
risk/return opportunities in the future.
Average short-term investments, which includes interest bearing cash, remain elevated due to continued strength
in core deposit balances which have grown 10% year-over-year. We have seen strength in both consumer and
commercial deposits. Compared to the prior quarter, average core deposits increased 3%. About two-thirds of the
balance growth on a sequential and year-over-year basis has come from consumer, reflecting continued fiscal
and monetary stimulus and strong household growth.
Moving to credit, our strong credit performance once again this quarter reflects our disciplined client selection,
conservative underwriting and prudent balance sheet management, while also benefiting from continued fiscal
and monetary stimulus and improvement in the broader economy.
The second quarter net charge-off ratio of 16 basis points was historically low and improved 11 basis points
sequentially. Nonperforming assets declined 16% or $126 million. The NPA ratio declined 11 basis points
sequentially to 61 basis points, which is comparable to the fourth quarter of 2019.

Also, our criticized assets declined 16% with significant improvements in retail non-essential, leisure and
healthcare, as well as in our energy and leveraged loan portfolios. However, we continue to focus on non-owner-
occupied commercial real estate, particularly central business district hotels.
Moving to the ACL, our base case macroeconomic scenario assumes the labor market continues to improve and
job growth continues to strengthen, with unemployment reaching 4% by the first quarter of 2022 and ending our
three-year reasonable and supportable period at around 3.5%.
We did not change our scenario weights of 60% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios.
Applying a 100% probability weighting to the base scenario would result in a $169 million reserve release.
Conversely applying 100% to the downside scenario would result in a $763 million build.
Inclusive of the impact of approximately $108 million in remaining discount associated with the MB loan portfolio,
our ACL ratio was 2.15%. Additionally, excluding the $3.7 billion in PPP loans with virtually no associated credit
reserve, the ACL ratio would be approximately 2.22%
While the favorable economic backdrop and our base case expectations point to further improvement in the
economy, there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario which could play out given the uncertain
environment. We continue to monitor the COVID situation which could still impact many businesses, particularly
those we have identified as being in highly impacted industries or reverse the rising consumer confidence trends.
Our June 30th allowance incorporates our best estimate of the economic environment with lower unemployment
and continued improving credit quality.
Moving to capital, our capital levels remained strong in the second quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at
10.4%, which is $1.3 billion above our stated target of 9.5%. Our tangible book value per share excluding AOCI
increased 3% during the quarter.
As a Category IV institution, Fifth Third was not subject to the latest Federal Reserve stress tests and we did not
opt-in. At the end of June, the Fed notified us that our SCB would be 2.5% effective July 1, which is the floor
under the regulatory capital rules. Without the floor, our buffer would have been approximately 2.1%.
During the quarter, we completed $347 million in share repurchases, which reduced our share count by
approximately 9 million shares compared to the first quarter. As Greg mentioned, we expect to repurchase
approximately $850 million of shares in the second half of 2021, while also increasing our common dividend in
September.
We also announced our acquisition of Provide this quarter. We will utilize approximately 20 basis points of CET1
upon closing. This financially compelling acquisition of an asset-generation engine dovetails perfectly with our
existing strategic focus on digital enablement and generating profitable growth on our balance sheet.
We believe in Provide's strong growth prospects. From an originations standpoint, they have produced $300
million in the first half of 2021, of which Fifth Third purchased approximately 80%. We expect second half
originations to be around $400 million, and given the expected early August closing, virtually all of that will go on
our balance sheet. We expect over $1 billion in originations in 2022 and could grow to over $2 billion annually
within a few years.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
Moving to our current outlook, for the full year, we expect average total loan balances to be stable compared to
last year, reflecting continued pressure from PPP forgiveness and pay-downs in commercial, combined with low
double-digit growth in consumer. We continue to expect CRE balances to remain stable in this environment.
We continue to expect our underlying NIM to be in the 305-basis-point area for the full year. Combined with our
loan outlook, we expect NII to be down 1% this year, assuming stable security balances and incorporating all PPP
impacts. On a sequential basis, we expect NII to decline around 2% given the impacts of the securities portfolio
prepayment income we experienced in the second quarter that we do not assume will repeat in our outlook, as
well as an assumed decline in PPP income.
Within our NII guidance, we expect approximately $165 million in PPP-related interest income for 2021, of which
$106 million was realized in the first half of the year, compared to $100 million in 2020 and approximately $50
million expected in 2022. For the third quarter of 2021, we expect approximately $40 million in PPP income.
Therefore, excluding PPP impacts, we would expect third quarter NII to decline around 1% compared to the
second quarter or up over 2% from the third quarter of 2020.
Given the continued strength throughout our businesses, we expect full-year fees to increase 7% to 8% compared
to 2020 or 8% to 9% excluding the impact of the TRA. Our outlook assumes a continued healthy economy as well
as our ongoing success taking market share as a result of our investments in talent and capabilities resulting in
stronger processing revenue, capital markets fees, and wealth and asset management revenue, which will be
partially offset by mortgage declines.
Additionally, as we discussed in January, we expect to generate private equity gains from several of our direct
investments and venture capital funds throughout 2021, potentially exceeding the 2020 level of $75 million. We
have recognized around $30 million in gains through the first half of 2021, which we expect to double in the
second half of 2021.
We expect third quarter total fees to be relatively stable from the second quarter and would be up mid to high
single digits year-over-year. In the mortgage business, we expect revenue throughout the second half of the year
to benefit from lower asset decay and higher servicing fees. The top line revenue is expected to decline high
single digits year-over-year due to continued headwinds from margin compression.
Our fee outlook does not incorporate a pre-tax gain of approximately $60 million associated with the sale of our
HSA business that is expected to close in the third quarter. We do plan to redeploy half of that gain in the third
quarter, split evenly between a $15 million donation to the Fifth Third Foundation that will complete our previously
announced philanthropy commitment to accelerating racial equality and inclusion in our communities, and a $15
million additional marketing program supporting momentum given the upside potential we see in that product.
We expect full-year expenses to be up 2% to 3% given our strong revenue outlook and the continued servicing
costs from the loan portfolio purchases as well as the incremental expenses associated with the Provide
acquisition. On a sequential basis, we expect expenses to be down 1%, excluding the redeployment of half of the
HSA gain.
As we've recently discussed, we expect to consolidate 42 branches primarily in our legacy Midwest footprint
which we expect to complete in early 2022. Additionally, we've opened five branches so far this year and plan to
add approximately 25 more Southeast in-market de novo branches in the second half of 2021. All run rate branch
impacts are included in our outlook.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
We generated year-over-year positive operating leverage this quarter and we expect to continue to generate
positive operating leverage for the second half of 2021, reflecting our expense actions, our continued success
growing our fee-based businesses and our proactive balance sheet management.
We expect total net charge-offs in 2021 to be 20 to 25 basis points, given the strong first half performance and
assuming our base case scenario continues to play out. Third quarter losses are likely to be in the 15- to 20-
basis-point range.
In summary, our second quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we've made over
the past few years toward achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. We will continue to rely on the
same principles of disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting and a focus on a long-term performance
horizon, which has served us well during this environment.
With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.

You guys are doing a lot to make Fifth Third more consumer-friendly, like Early Pay and Extra Time. If we expect
that trend to continue, like, what's the total amount of fees or revenue that might be at risk? Is the broader industry
really continues to wean itself off of consumer fees?

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Ken, it's Jamie. Thanks for the question. The one thing we are proud of at Fifth Third is how much we've
reduced our exposure on the consumer side from a punitive fee standpoint and how we are, I would say, a very
consumer-focused and consumer-friendly bank. I think 3% or so of our revenue is in consumer overdrafts and our
peers are significantly higher than those levels.
We expect to continue to improve upon that with the Momentum Bank offering and some of the features that Greg
talked about in his prepared remarks. So, I think you can continue to expect that from us and that if we were to
have any future changes on overdraft policies or fees, it would only be to the positive and that we would more
than make up for with the incremental volume from Momentum.
I don't know, Tim, if there's anything else you want to add?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. No, I just want to emphasize that. I mean, whenever you launch a new product, the tradeoff yet to evaluate
is what you think you can produce as it relates to total franchise growth relative to any sort of cannibalization,
right? So the fact that we have been deliberate about driving revenue growth through value-added services as
opposed to maintenance and punitive fees means that, for us, we're going to get the benefit of the franchise
growth and more households from Momentum, with comparatively substantially less impact than any of our large
competitors would have to the extent that they would attempt to follow us here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. And then just maybe a second question. In terms of the Ginnie Mae buyouts, I think some of the
other banks this quarter have mentioned they just didn't see the opportunity or they didn't have – or they couldn't
find the opportunity, whatever, to do a lot – the Ginnie Mae buyouts. But it feels like you guys got a fairly decent
benefit from that this quarter. Was that – are you seeing the same trends or do you still see opportunities to
continue that going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
A very good question actually, because what we've seen is that, given we were first mover in this product as far
back as the third quarter of 2020 when we bought our own pools and then helped structure these additional
purchases that we've done totaling $3.7 billion thus far to-date, I would say that the economics were certainly
more attractive if you were in the first mover stage and the economics have really waned to the point that we
would not be pursuing additional purchases at these levels.

R. Scott Siefers Q

I just wanted to ask at sort of a top level on sort of the eventuality about commercial recovery. What's in your best
guess as to what that will look like for larger regionals like yourself? It's sort of unclear the degree to which capital
markets competition will abate. I guess there are questions regarding the sustainability of the sort of the sugar
high that consumers are on right now, meaning demand could decrease the further we go, and then you've got all
this excess liquidity that's getting worked through. So, just curious to hear your top-level thoughts on what that
recovery will ultimately look like in your eyes?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Let me start then I'll hand over to Jamie or Tim for additional color. First off, it's – right now there's just a lot of
uncertainty out there right now as we're dealing with the labor shortages and supply chain disruptions which are
extremely real. You see it across the board in all conversations with our customers. But with that said, we're back
to pretty much pre-pandemic level production numbers. But payouts continue to be stout and obviously you've got
some of the headwind with PPP.
So, when you think about the environment in front of us, I think loan growth, this will continue to be a challenge as
we go through the rest of the year. I think we offset that by our strength from our fee businesses, as we've talked
about in the prepared remarks, to compensate for some of those challenges. But I do think this changes over
time. You think about our line utilization at 31%, we run 36%, 37%. Every 1% is $750 million. So there's a lot of
upside opportunity there.
At some point, labor shortage and supply chain constraints start to abate and we pick up the benefit of that. We
also added about $2.4 billion in new commitments since the beginning of the year and continue to acquire new
households and commercial relationships. So we're very, very positive as to what the future might hold while
we've got some economic and some environmental challenges in front of us to be able to continue to deal with.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. No, I think when we announced NorthStar and we talked about pivoting the return profile of the bank to be
good through the cycle, a portion of focus there was on business mix, right? It was about constructing a business
portfolio that had balance. So, in an environment where utilization is down like now and where rates are low, we
have fee businesses that are firing, that are providing nice support and some counter-cyclical businesses, in
particular on the consumer side like autos and mortgages which are doing very, very well, right?
I think as some of the tailwind from those businesses abates, what you would expect to see is the benefit both, as
Greg mentioned, as it relates to line utilization and ultimately some benefit from rates, which provides a lot of
support for the through-the-cycle focus.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect. Okay. Good. Thank you for those thoughts. And then maybe just a thought on overall reserving levels.
You guys still maintain a very high and conservative overall reserve. How are you sort of thinking about the
steady state? Is it back to where we were CECL day one? Or just given the backdrop in what we've already gone
through, can we kind of blow through that a little bit on – meaning lower than that? How do you think about those
dynamics?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
It's Jamie. I'll take that one. When you look at the quarter with the ACL release of $159 million, we had that split
fairly evenly between the consumer portfolio and the commercial portfolio, and the decline was essentially driven
by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook versus the prior quarter. When you look ahead, we continue to
overweight the non-baseline scenarios at 20%, so that the upside is 20%, the base is 60% and the downside is
20%. And that's really driven by the uncertainty in the environment, including the vaccine efficacy, and frankly this
week's concerns highlight that risk.
So, when you look at the asymmetrical nature of the upside and downside scenarios, that weighting versus the
80%-10%-10% on CECL day one generates about $90 million higher reserves. So I guess the first part to your
fairly complicated question is that the scenario weightings do matter and we expect to maintain the 60%-20%-
20% while this period of uncertainty continues to exist.
And then relative to day one, it really is a tale of two portfolios. So, when you look at the commercial side, to get
back to those day-one adoption reserve rates, you really do need to see a sustained strength on even the credit
characteristics of the borrowers that are most at risk due to longer-term negative impacts from the pandemic. And
so, that would have to occur in conjunction with improving an economic forecast above our current expectations.
But then when you look at the consumer side, we're actually already below the CECL day-one level. We're at
1.99% at the end of the second quarter versus the 2.46% on CECL day one, and that's driven by the combination
of the loan mix as well as improvements in real estate and auto collateral values experienced since the adoption
of CECL, as well as the economic forecasts at the end of the second quarter. And then we've had improvement in
credit quality in auto and card, as well as in the delinquency rate. So consumer is already there but commercial,
again, we'd have to have things play out differently than what we – better than what we currently expect.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I just wanted to go back, Greg, on your announcement partnering with FIS on the modern core and on the wealth
management side. If you could give us some visibility on three things. One, what that means for near-term
expense impact? What it means for longer-term efficiency as you kind of go through that process, if you could tell
us what the timeline would be? And then, finally, we are hearing from other banks talking about moving to a
modern core and that being a competitive advantage. Do you see that as a competitive advantage for Fifth Third
when you get to that point, or is it table stakes given where the industry is moving?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Okay. That's a lot there. So, let me try and dissect a little bit for you. First off, the FIS announcement we just made
is a continuation of a relationship that's been in place for quite some time as a replacement of our WAM through
our core deposit platforms. But we've been on this journey to reengineer our technical infrastructure, focusing on
the actual resiliency, the scalability of our businesses, replace our HR platform with Workday. We completed our
enterprise and data strategy. We completely re-platformed our mortgage LOS environment. So the FIS is the
natural extension of the continuation of the modernization of those activities.
And we also reengineered and restructured the pricing agreement of our legacy relationship with FIS. That's going
to help make the costs associated with that implementation of the new FIS components a lot more reasonable,
digestible for us that will manage our costs going forward. So we're pretty pleased with the way that came out.
As far as the competitive advantage, listen, I think at the end of the day, this is a long game. We have to continue
to refresh our platforms. We're going to continue to modernize our platforms to the cloud. I think every bank is
trying to get this right. So, whether it becomes a competitive advantage or not, I think it's a requirement and it's
basically table stakes to be in a business to be a digital bank. Our customers expect the bank anywhere, anytime.
We have to have platforms that are always on.
So, that's just the retransformation of our business. We have to repurpose our expense dollars from the legacy
brick-and-mortar infrastructure and we've got to continue to reinvestment in technology. So we're going to
continue to do that. And I think the banks that don't do that are going to be at competitive disadvantage. But many
banks, as you've already heard, will continue to focus on core modernization and we're going to be doing the
same thing.
We think we have a great strategy for that modernization and for bringing in new technologies. We have a buy-
partner-build strategy that we've worked on very hard. And if the technology is already out there, we buy it. If we
can't buy it, we partner. And if we can't partner, we build it. Momentum is example of that, partnerships like
GreenSky, AvidXchange, DadeSystems, CommonBond, and down the list and our recent acquisition of Provide.
So I think we've got a good strategy for moving quickly, but it is going to take time to get all the legacy stuff re-
platformed. But net-net, once again, I think it may not be a competitive advantage at the end of the day, but it
definitely will be a requirement to be in this business in the future.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
That's good color. Appreciate it. And just as a follow-up to that. When you think about acquisition of Provide,
healthcare is obviously a very hot sector. Do you see more opportunities like that across different verticals where
maybe we should expect similar kind of deals which become tools for client acquisitions?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Sure. This is Tim. I'm happy to take that one. So, healthcare was the right starting point for us. It's the first
industry vertical that we launched here over a decade ago. And we have a vertically integrated strategy on that
front across our corporate banking group – our middle market banking group out in the regions and now also
business banking.
I think Provide was an important next step for us in this strategy because it gave us the opportunity to provide a
differentiated value proposition to independent medical practices, like Greg mentioned, with a big focus on
dentists, vets, and otherwise. And Provide was a little bit unique in that it had, as a fintech company, actually
already grown into one of the largest lenders into that market, driven primarily by their technology and their
expertise.
And just as a point of example there, the digital experience that they offer enables them to get loans approved
and closed about 70% faster than a typical lending process within that market. And in addition, because of the
sector focus, they have a growing digital marketplace that actually allows existing practice owners who would like
to transition into retirement to post their practices for sale and they get connected with folks who are interested in
buying an established practice. And so, it functions I guess a little bit like the Craigslist or the eBay of dental
practices today.
Are there opportunities in other verticals? Yeah, we do think there are and we have been pretty active, as Greg
mentioned, in partnering with many of those firms. Whether those relationships evolve from a partnership into an
outright acquisition, I think it depends a lot on the circumstances and business at any given point in time. But in
the case of Provide, their next leg of the growth journey was going to be about the delivery of the broad, the full
set of products and services, and it absolutely made sense for them to be part of the bank as opposed to a stand-
alone entity on that journey.

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Good morning, Gerard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Jamie, this question is for you. On the securities portfolio, can you share with us – I saw the yield as you
presented in your deck increase sequentially and I was wondering how you achieved that in this rate environment.
And was it due to the derivatives and hedges you have on the books?
And then, second, I think you said that obviously you're going to keep the liquidity in the portfolio until rates start
to rise. I think you mentioned the 2% rate. Would you lean into it as rates were to go to 2%, if they do, or would
you wait until we actually got to 2% before you really move?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. I think if you look back at our actions in the first quarter, to answer the second part of your question, if you
look back at our first quarter actions, we did leg into a little bit of additional investment portfolio buildup at that
point in time. We pre-invested $1 billion of our second quarter cash flows and then, given the entry points and the
rally in the bond market, decided to maintain that additional leverage throughout the quarter. So we did grow the
book a little bit in the second quarter. Our guide assumes we hold it fairly stable as the year progresses because
we don't expect to get to those 2% or better entry points.
But should the market get there, we would leg into the trade and not do everything all at once. But when you look
at our additional $30 billion of excess liquidity that we're sitting on, we've earmarked about one-third of that to go
into the investment portfolio. So, to get $10 billion of purchases done would certainly take some time and we've
ramped that up over time. And our goal here is, we sift through peer results and actions versus ours, and we
certainly are an outlier in terms of being, I think, more prudent and more cautious at deploying at these low rates.
Our goal is let's maximize our NII over the next five years, not over the next 12 months, and we think ultimately
that this is the better outcome. And the Fed will eventually taper, not sure when that will be. But when the largest
bond buyer in the world is price indiscriminate in their purchases every month, it certainly distorts the market. So,
eventually that distortion is going to end and we think we'll get better entry points than what we see today.
And then in terms of the first part of your question, the growth in the yield this quarter in the investment portfolio is
really the benefit of what we did five years ago with structuring the portfolio to be more weighted to bullet and
locked-out cash flows, so that to the extent there are prepayments in the portfolio, the make-whole provisions
provide a nice pickup in investment yield. And as we – we never include those in our outlook, so that the guide on
NII might look soft on the surface. But if things continue to be the same, then obviously NII will outperform the
guide should those prepayment penalties continue to occur. We're sitting on almost $2 billion in gains in the
investment portfolio.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. Thank you for the color. And then, Greg, I've asked this question in the past but I'll ask it again, which
is when you sit down with your senior management team and you guys look out over the risks that you foresee in
the horizon, and if we take the Delta variant and the COVID risk off the table, since that's an obvious one, what
are some of the risks that you guys wrestle with as you look out over the next 12 months that we just have to keep
our eye on and looking around the corner, so that we're not surprised a year from now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. It's a good question. Obviously, I would have responded immediately with the variant of COVID and what
that could mean to the slowing down of the economy and not getting the robust recovery we were all hoping for
and creating risk. I think right now, as I mentioned earlier, Gerard, I think about every customer I sit down with,
Tim sits down with and we have a conversation. And you're seeing it in various ways, labor shortage, supply chain
constraints, significant issues out there right now. You're seeing that in backlogs, order delays, restaurants not
being able to be open, small businesses not open full-time, can't get labor. So it's a big challenge right now.
And when does that start to abate? When does that start to correct itself? And I'm not sure when that is. I believe
it'll happen obviously. But to – whether that's later this year or is it the next year, so I think that's going to put a lot
of pressure. Inventory levels are extremely low compared with the demand that is out there. We're not seeing that
tick up right now. Line utilization is kind of flat right now, but we're not seeing that tick up that we were hoping to
see. So, those are all kind of concerns that I have right now. Obviously, inflation is another concern out there as
we watch that and how the Fed manages through that complexity and more to come on that. But net-net, I think
overall the economy is fairly healthy. We've just got some challenges still in front of us that haven't been
understood yet.

No, I just was going to say if you – just to add a little bit of color, Greg and I together were out, we spent a full day
in 12 of our 13 regions this quarter, which made for a busy travel schedule, but a lot of good input in terms of what
we're actually hearing from clients on the ground. And I mean, some of the stories that you hear about how
people are dealing with the labor shortages or inventory supply issues are wild. I mean, we have a client, a field
marketer, who had to open their own driving school, so that they can get people – enough folks with qualified

commercial driver's licenses to do field deliveries. You have hospitals who are operating at 50% capacity on the
elective portions of their business which are really important driver, right, when you think about the revenues.

Gregory D. Carmichael A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah, who can't get enough skilled nursing staff on hand to be able to operate at levels above that. And we had
folks who had been sending employees out to a local CVS or a Walgreens and buying out all of the Gorilla Glue
because the adhesives that are used to seal together their cardboard packaging are backlogged owing to the
hard freeze in Texas this last winter.
I mean, it really -they're not theoretical concepts when you get out and you talk to our middle-market clients. They
are really hard realities that they are grappling with. And I think as Greg said, we all hope that especially if the
enhanced unemployment benefits wane and as we work through some of these supply chain challenges, that our
clients are able to invest in their business. But if you can't get the people, you can't get the materials, you can't
invest to grow.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Is there any risk, and just to follow-up quickly, that there's a permanent change in the way these companies will
manage themselves, which would lead to a lesser need from borrowing from banks like yours because of what
they're going through? Have you heard that at all from your customers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Fifth Third Bancorp
No, no, not yet. I think we hear them exploring opportunities to be less reliant on manual labor and to drive
automation, but that drives CapEx, right, so that helps us. We hear them exploring opportunities to secure more
captive supply and otherwise through M&A, but that also drives borrowing in terms of the way that we operate.
And ironically actually we hear many of them say, hey, we have been pushing for decades now to run more asset-
light, which meant less liquidity on hand, and maybe we don't want to do that going forward and we're willing to
absorb slightly higher debt service costs in favour of being a little bit more liquid. And that would be helpful to us in
terms of the way it drives borrowing. So, I don't think so, Gerard, it's just – we got to see our way through to the
other side of this because if you can't get labor, you can't get inventory, it's hard to grow.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thanks. Good morning. Can you relate the fee income strength you saw this quarter to the growth you're seeing
in the Southeast region? Are you leading in the Southeast with your fee-based products like treasury
management rather than credit as you grow into that region? And if you could discuss the longer-term growth
outlook across your other fee-based products in the Southeast?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Sure. Bill, it's Tim. I'll take that. I think the growth, if you look at new client relationships and otherwise, is
very strong in the commercial business in the Southeast. So they are contributing disproportionately to the
incremental fee income. But I wouldn't tell you that it is focused exclusively on the Southeast. If you look at our
new commercial relationships, about 30% of them this year are lead with treasury management. And then there is
another percentage which I don't have off the top of my head but which has come to us primarily through the
capital markets business. So we are having good success using those products as wedge opportunities to drive
new relationships.
If you look forward, I think we're trying to build what is a really nicely diversified capital markets business with low
activities, like rates and commodities hedging and otherwise, to complement the M&A advisory business and what
we do in equities with what we do on the bond market. I think what we continue to anticipate is at some point here
the capital markets will be a little bit less accommodative. We'll get the benefit of that in loan balances, but you'll
see some lightning on bond fees. But the other side of it is we're sitting on an M&A pipeline now which is almost
double what it was in January 1 of this year. So we do have a nice M&A advisory pipeline that should come
behind it.
On the treasury management side, we've pretty consistently grown at the rate of the industry plus 2 to 3
percentage points. I am of the belief that we can do better than that, but it's definitely better to be taking share
there over time than just to have the alternative situation. So we feel good about both of those fee lines over the
near to medium term.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
That's very helpful. Thank you. And Greg, you mentioned GreenSky when talking about your partnerships earlier.
Can you give us an update on how you're thinking about indirect lending partnerships more broadly and the
opportunity to leverage these partnerships to continue to grow naturally beyond your footprint? Critics of that
model argue that you really need to own the relationship and are at a disadvantage when all you're doing is
putting up your balance sheet and somebody else has the relationship with the customer, but would love to hear
your thoughts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
First off, there's not a lot of these opportunities out there. The economics of the GreenSky relationship and as we
wanted as an investor have made a lot of sense for us. This is not how we grow our business over time. We're
much more relationship business. That's why the Provide acquisition was extremely important. If you think about
Provide, that was a partnership originally we had about $400 million in assets, but 70% of those relationships we
had additional relationship outside the credit facility, whether it be TM or deposit relationship. So, that was
important.

So, relationship type of opportunity for us, and that's what we're looking for to continue to enhance our business
and grow our businesses. GreenSky created another channel for us, but yes, that's a non-relationship business
for us. And those opportunities that make sense to us are very few out there, but the GreenSky one does for the
economics and the transaction we've put in place.

Kenneth M. Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks and good morning. Couple of quick ones. First of all, the third quarter Momentum marketing program that
you mentioned where you used part of that benefit, is that just to get it kick started and then would you have
ongoing expenses related to marketing built into your forward outlook past 3Q?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah, it's Jamie. Yes, the $15 million incremental spend over the second quarter marketing spend level of $20
million, so we expect to spend $35 million to marketing in the third quarter. That should abate going forward.
However, if it is successful, then we'll continue the program at that elevated level until we've really captured as
much of the first mover advantage with the product as we can.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth M. Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Got it. Understood. And then do you have any plans to or thoughts on resecuritizing those Ginnie Mae
loans, the $3.7 billion that you mentioned. I know some of them are newer, so they might not have quite gotten to
that seasoning point yet. But is that at all in your outlook in terms of whether they stay in loans or move to
mortgage banking over time?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
So, for the $3.7 billion of loans that we've purchased from other third-party servicers, we have a – there's a
nominal amount of fees assumed in the outlook related to that as they get resold to the servicer. The bigger
economic opportunity is on the $750 million of forbearance loans that we bought directly back from Ginnie Mae on
our own production as well as within our resi mortgage portfolio to the extent that there are any on nonaccrual or
delinquents that cure. We do have – we have had sales this year that generate several million dollars in fees and
we expect to do that over the next six, seven quarters as well. So I think it's more of a run rate normal course of
business than it is any one-time pop.

deposits? What's the balancing act in terms of where you want that long-term debt footprint to settle over time?
Thanks, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Given the excess liquidity that we have, there's clearly not a need to maintain the higher unsecured debt
levels that we have. We have an additional maturity in the third quarter we'll most likely not replace, that's about
$850 million, almost of 3% rate. So there's a little bit left to go in terms of improvement, along with running down
the wholesale CD book. But those benefits are all baked into our outlook, so I would not expect it to get better
than what we've guided to from the right-hand side of the sheet. I think the opportunity for us from an NII
improvement standpoint will be on the left-hand side of the sheet.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
On the loan growth side, on the utilization, I know you expect it to improve by about 1% through the year-end.
Can you just help out with what is your pre-pandemic utilization level and maybe an expected timing where you
think you can get back to that level on that front?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah, it's a great question. I wish I knew the answer to that. I do know that first part of the year we would typically
run around 36%, 37%. As I mentioned, every 1% is about our $750 million in assets. So we're running at 31%,
kind of flat line right there. I can't really – we're hopeful, but like I tell my team, hope is not a strategy. We're
hopeful we start to see that tick up a little bit based on the production levels that we're seeing out there right now,
hopefully get some of these challenges in front of us on the supply chain and labor for us, maybe abating a little
later this year. But once again, it's a tough thing to say. When do we get back to a normalized run rate? It's going
to be a while, I mean, it's going to be in quarters, not – and maybe a year plus before we get there, I believe.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
No, that's helpful. And on that same topic, on the loan growth guide, I know you indicated a double-digit consumer
growth, stable CRE, you've got PPP impacting commercial. What would be your growth expectation for
commercial with PPP and ex-PPP on that full-year guide?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Relatively stable on commercial. Yeah, I would say, John, I would say full-year commercial average loans would
be down mid-single digits and ex-PPP a little bit more than that, but ending the year with a little bit closer to
stable. And then PPP is – we've been running steadily down as the year has progressed where on an end-of-
period basis we finished the first quarter at $5.4 billion, we finished the second quarter at $3.7 billion. That will
continue to drift down to $2.1 billion at the end of the third quarter and then $1.7 billion at year-end is our current
projection on PPP.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then lastly, on the M&A front, as you look at the incremental opportunities there, Greg,
just wanted to get your thoughts on potential incremental bank and non-bank. And I guess, more importantly,
curious what you think of President Biden's executive order and the implied added scrutiny around bank deals. Do
you believe that could impact a bank of your size looking at a potential whole bank deal?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. I guess, first off, I would respond by saying our focus is on non-bank transactions that enhance our product
and service capabilities, like Provide would be a great example of that. So we'll stay focused there for the most
part. If the right opportunity presents itself in a market that's attractive to us, it kind of solves what MB Financial
solved for us in Chicago, obviously we always consider those type of opportunities, but they're far and few
between and not the focus of the organization.
As far as Biden's executive order, listen, there's a lot of work to be done. The agencies, the OCC, Fed and FDIC
and the DOJ are trying to figure out what that means. So, more to come on that, but you can believe as I do that
transactions – the economics of transactions could be more challenging going forward. It's an executive order and
the timeline to get those transactions approved, they take a little bit longer, but good transactions will get done.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning, guys. Just talk a bit more about the path to the 9.5% CET1 target. Obviously, you talked about the
dividend increase, the buybacks back half this year, the 20-basis-point drag. But if you put all that together, you're
still going to be it seems like kind of treading water on the capital just given the good earnings generation and
probably not a lot of balance sheet growth the next few quarters. So, do you think you'll get that target or you're
going to hold back for kind of the loan growth and maybe just flesh it out a little bit as we think about the first half
next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Our goal is certainly to get to the 9.5% by June of 2022. And yes, it is certainly a large amount of
repurchases. I think the two factors to bake into it would be there's 20 basis points of CET1 erosion from the
Provide acquisition in the third quarter and then 9 basis points of CECL transition in the first quarter of 2022. So, a
little bit of capital gets spent there. But, yes, to your point, we have a lot of capital deployment opportunity ahead
of us to get to the 9.5%. And certainly, if loan growth doesn't materialize, then we'll look to continue to hit the
9.5%.
And then we do feel that should loan growth accelerates, we certainly have a buffer from where we think we need
to run the company from a capital perspective. Clearly, from the credit outcomes you're seeing, we could run the
balance sheet at 9% or so if loan growth were to accelerate. But, for now, our focus is just getting to the 9.5% by
mid-year next year.

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
I wanted to ask just on the middle market and small business. Are you seeing any willingness of them maybe to
tap their lines of credit while maintaining higher levels of cash on hand, or is it just an issue of the supply and
labor shortages that's holding it all back?

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
Hey, Peter. It's Tim. I would tell you, it's primarily issues with supply chain and labor, like Greg said, and not
liquidity. If you're looking for green shoots, I think the borrowers who are either smaller or who rely on structures
that look more like asset-based lending structures are starting to tap their lines. So we are seeing modest
improvements in utilization in that sector. Now, in aggregate, that's not a large segment of our balance sheet,
which is the reason that you see utilization overall at Fifth Third being stable. But generally, as these things
happen, they happen at the lower end of the book first then they migrate upward into the larger borrowers. So, I at
least, when I feel like finding a positive signal, that's where I'm going these days.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then, Jamie, can I just ask about the outlook for the margin in the second half of the year, some of the
puts and takes?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Sure. The second quarter was obviously very strong from a margin perspective and we're pleased with how the
balance sheet has been performing. But given the high levels of PPP as well as the investment securities
prepayment penalties that we don't expect to recur or at least don't forecast to recur, we would expect to see the
NIM decline a bit to a more normalized level, which is that 305-basis-point area is what we've talked about. But I
think pretty much all year in terms of what we think this balance sheet should stabilize at certainly for the
foreseeable future.
So, NIM should come down, call it, 5 bps or so in the third quarter with, say, the big drivers there certainly the
PPP, the prepayment penalties, a little bit of day count and otherwise, still maintain that floor of 305 basis points
or better.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Konrad with KBW.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Joseph Konrad Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. A quick follow-up on the securities portfolio. Maybe, Jamie, can you remind us what the
remaining duration is for the bullet structured product?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
So the total portfolio is a 4.9 years duration and so the bullets – when we quote the 58% number, we're saying it's
bullet or locked-out for at least the next two years, but the duration of that portfolio is not that different from the
portfolio in total.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Joseph Konrad Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. So the lock-out is two additional years?

James C. Leonard A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Correct, but there's not a step down. For a while, we had quoted a 12-month and then we got the question, so we
expanded it to 24 months. But there's not a cliff here, it's just a slow erosion over time.

Operator: Our next question is from Christopher Marinac with Janney Montgomery Scott.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Thanks. Just wanted to go back to the regulatory question before, Greg. Is the environment any different than it
would have been six or nine months ago, whether it's a CFPB or any of the agencies?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Well, listen, obviously with the deck (sic) [desk] chairs changing right now and are still in process on the CFPB
front from a nomination perspective. So, is it changed? Listen, I don't believe it's changed to be honest with you. I
think at the end of day these agencies have a job to do and a role to play. And I think the focus of the CFPB and
the OCC and the FDIC are going to be making sure that there's the safety and soundness, but also the way that
banks handle themselves and operate are going to be extremely important. So I haven't sensed a big shift with
the new administration on requirements and demands of the bank and the totality so to speak from the top as to
what they expect from us. So it's not something that keeps me up at night, let's put it that way.
