Q3 2024 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2024
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to
welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. On behalf of Goldman
Sachs, I will begin the call with the following disclaimer.
The earnings presentation can be found on the Investor Relations page of the Goldman Sachs website and
contains information on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. This audiocast is copyrighted

I will now turn the call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and Chief Financial
Officer, Denis Coleman. Thank you. Mr. Solomon, you may begin your conference.

David Michael Solomon
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. In the third quarter, we produced net
revenues of $12.7 billion and generated earnings per share of $8.40, an ROE of 10.4% and an ROTE of 11.1%.
Overall, I'm pleased with our performance, especially in a quarter where our results were impacted by selected
items, including the narrowing of our consumer footprint, which reduced our ROE by 80 basis points.
Our performance demonstrates the strength of our world-class and interconnected franchises, where we were
effectively serving clients in a complex backdrop. In Global Banking & Markets, we remain the premier M&A
advisor and a leading global risk intermediary. Across investment banking, corporates and sponsors remain
actively engaged, and we see significant pent-up demand from our clients. Our backlog rose again this quarter,
driven by advisory, and we expect our leading investment banking franchise to benefit from the continued
resurgence in activity.
In FICC, we delivered record financing revenues and facilitated our clients' risk intermediation needs, particularly
as activity levels picked up towards the end of the quarter. And in equities, we reported a very strong performance
across both intermediation and financing. Overall, our global, broad and deep platforms remain exceptionally well-
positioned to support our clients' evolving needs across products and asset classes.
And in Asset & Wealth Management, our position as a leading global active asset manager, a top five alternatives
player and a premier ultra-high net worth franchise affords us significant opportunities in secular growth areas.
Our assets under supervision reached another record this quarter, surpassing $3 trillion and representing our 27th
consecutive quarter of long-term net inflows.
We demonstrated further growth in more durable management and other fees and private banking and lending
revenues, which together were a record $3.4 billion this quarter and up 9% versus last year. We remain confident
in our ability to grow these more durable revenues at a high single-digit pace over the coming years. In
alternatives, fundraising remains strong. We raised over $50 billion year-to-date and now expect 2024 fundraising
to exceed $60 billion as we see ongoing demand across asset classes, including private credit, private equity,
secondaries and infrastructure.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2024
In Wealth Management, we grew our total client assets to $1.6 trillion and our ultra-high net worth franchise is
well-positioned to continue to grow globally as we expand our advisor footprint and our leading offerings – and our
lending offerings to clients. Our pre-tax margin in AWM is up meaningfully from last year and in line with our mid-
20s target. We remain focused on further improving the margins and returns in this business while also investing
to drive growth across Wealth Management, alternatives and solutions.
As I look at the operating backdrop, the US economy continues to be resilient. Inflation has been coming down,
the recent unemployment data is supportive, and while we've seen some softness in consumer behavior, the tone
of my recent conversations with clients has been quite constructive. The beginning of the rate cut cycle has
renewed optimism for a soft landing, which should spur increased economic activity.
More broadly, clients remain highly focused on the trajectory of rates in jurisdictions around the world, the policy
implications of global elections particularly in the US, and the high levels of geopolitical instability. Against this
backdrop, our leading global franchises are supporting our clients as they navigate risks and position themselves
for a range of outcomes.
Before I turn it over to Denis, I want to spend a moment on capital and Basel III Revisions. Although we have
closely followed the recent remarks from regulatory officials about the upcoming reproposal, we continue to have
concerns about the overall regulatory process. There remains a lack of transparency and appreciation for the
interconnectedness of capital requirements across the proposed fundamental review of the trading book, CCAR
and the G-SIB buffer.
We recognize this is an ongoing process that will take time. But as we've said before, we need to get this right.
The final rule will have a significant impact on the growth and competitiveness of the US economy. Requiring too
much capital will increase the cost of credit for businesses large and small and will impact growth across the
country. We look forward to receiving more clarity from our regulators once the reproposal is published and
participating in the new comment period. We remain very engaged both as an industry and as a firm.
In closing, I feel very good about the trajectory of Goldman Sachs. We are leaning into our strengths, our client
franchise is stronger than ever, and we continue to harness our One Goldman Sachs approach. Our world-class
talent, execution capabilities and risk management expertise are core to who we are as a firm and allow us to
provide differentiated service to our clients and outperform for shareholders through the cycle.
Let me now turn it over to Denis to cover our financial results in more detail.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on page 1 of the presentation. In the third quarter, we
generated net revenues of $12.7 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Earnings per share of $8.40, up 54% year-over-
year. Our ROE was 10.4% and an ROTE of 11.1%. As David mentioned, our results were impacted by select
items, including agreements to transition the GM Card platform and to sell our portfolio of seller financing loans. In
aggregate, these items reduced EPS by $0.62 and our ROE by 80 basis points.
Now turning to performance by segment, starting on page 4. Global Banking & Markets produced revenues of
$8.6 billion in the third quarter. Advisory revenues of $875 million were up both sequentially and versus the prior-
year period. We remain number one in the league tables for announced and completed M&A for the year-to-date.
Equity underwriting revenues rose 25% year-over-year to $385 million, as equity capital markets have continued
to reopen, though volumes are still well below longer term averages.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2024
Debt underwriting revenues rose 46% year-over-year to $605 million amid higher leveraged finance and
investment-grade activity. We are seeing increased client demand for committed acquisition financing, which we
expect to continue on the back of increasing M&A activity. Overall, our investment banking backlog rose quarter-
on-quarter, driven by advisory.
FICC net revenues of $3 billion in the quarter were down from a strong performance last year, amid a relatively
quieter summer, though we saw a meaningful pick-up in activity in September. A decline in intermediation
revenues was partially offset by record FICC financing revenues of $949 million, which rose 30% year-over-year,
primarily on better results within mortgages and structured lending.
Equities net revenues were $3.5 billion in the quarter, up 18% versus the prior year. Equities intermediation
revenues were $2.2 billion, up 29% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong performance across derivatives and
cash products. Equities financing revenues of $1.3 billion rose versus the prior year amid higher average
balances. Across FICC and equities, financing revenues were a record $6.6 billion for the year-to-date, a direct
result of the successful execution on our strategic priority to improve the durability of our revenue base.
Moving to Asset & Wealth Management on page 5. Revenues of $3.8 billion were up 16% year-over-year. Our
more durable management and other fees and private banking and lending revenues reached a new record this
quarter of $3.4 billion. Management and other fees increased 3% sequentially to a record $2.6 billion for the
quarter and $7.6 billion for the year-to-date, well on the way to achieving our $10 billion annual target for 2024.
Private banking and lending revenues rose sequentially to $756 million. We are seeing positive momentum in this
business, and we remain focused on increasing lending penetration and expanding our loan product offerings.
Incentive fees for the quarter were $85 million. We continue to expect to reach our annual target of $1 billion over
the medium-term, supported by approximately $4 billion of unrecognized incentive fees as of the last quarter.
Equity and debt investments revenues totaled $294 million, reflecting NII in our debt portfolio and mark-ups in our
public equity portfolio. For the year-to-date, we generated $1.5 billion in combined equity and debt investments
revenues.
Now moving to page 6. Total assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record of $3.1 trillion, bolstered by
$37 billion of liquidity products net inflows and $29 billion of long-term net inflows across asset classes. We
continue to see traction in our solutions business, where we are leveraging our SMA capabilities and outsourced
CIO platform to deliver customized multi-asset solutions.
Turning to page 7 on alternatives. Alternative AUS totaled $328 billion at the end of the third quarter, driving $527
million in management and other fees. Gross third-party fundraising was $16 billion in the third quarter and over
$50 billion for the year-to-date. This brings cumulative third-party fundraising to more than $300 billion since our
Investor Day in 2020. We further reduced our historical principal investment portfolio by $1.7 billion in the third
quarter to $10.9 billion, bringing year-to-date reductions to $5.4 billion.
On page 9, firm-wide net interest income was $2.6 billion in the quarter, up versus the prior-year period, reflecting
an increase in interest-earning assets. Our total loan portfolio at quarter-end was $192 billion, up year-over-year,
driven by an increase in other collateralized lending. For the third quarter, our provision for credit losses was $397
million, primarily driven by net charge-offs in our credit card portfolio and partially offset by $70 million of net
recoveries on previously impaired wholesale loans.

Turning to expenses on page 10. Total quarterly operating expenses were $8.3 billion. Our year-to-date
compensation ratio, net of provisions, is 33.5%. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4.2 billion, down
14% year-over-year. We remain focused on driving efficiencies across the firm, given ongoing inflationary
pressures, competition for talent, and our desire to invest in our engineering and technology platforms. Our
effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2024 was 22.6%. For the full year, we continue to expect a tax rate of
approximately 22%.
Next, capital on slide 11. In the quarter, we returned $2 billion to common shareholders, including dividends of
$978 million and stock repurchases of $1 billion. Our common equity tier 1 ratio was 14.6% at the end of the third
quarter under the standardized approach.
During the quarter, the Federal Reserve reduced our SCB requirement by 20 basis points to 6.2% following a
successful appeal process, resulting in a standardized common equity tier 1 ratio requirement of 13.7%, which
became effective October 1. We remain very engaged with our regulators on creating a less volatile and more
transparent process. Given our 90 basis point buffer, we continue to have flexibility on capital deployment and are
very well-positioned to serve our clients and return capital to shareholders.
In conclusion, our overall performance reflected the strength of our client franchise and the improving operating
environment. We are executing on our strategy, where we are maintaining and strengthening our leadership
positions across Global Banking & Markets and leaning into secular growth opportunities in Asset & Wealth
Management. Across both businesses, we are making strong progress in growing our more durable revenue
streams. Simply put, we are playing to our strength as a firm and we remain confident in our ability to drive returns
for shareholders while continuing to support our clients.
With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thanks very much. So, trading question. I mean, the Markets business has been great. Markets have been
supportive. But I guess my question is, is to your comments on the regulatory perception perhaps of trading in
general. And August looked like a spike in volatility, but it looks like you did really well. This marks many quarters
that you and others have done very well for years. Do you feel the business is managed better? Do you feel like
your results mean anything towards the outcome on the regulatory side? I'm just curious on what the – if the
evidence matters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
I appreciate the question, Glenn, and – I mean, it's a hard question to answer. I think we've been clear on some of
the advocacy we're doing around the regulatory process. But I've also been clear that regulatory environments
ebb and flow and that people can be policy. And so, over time, you see shifts in all this, and our job, I think we've
done this effectively over a very long period of time, is to adapt and adjust and be nimble to the different
regulatory environments.
With respect to the business of Markets, which includes FICC intermediation and FICC financing and equities
intermediation and equities financing, I think we have an extraordinary leading franchise that we've invested in
over a long period of time. We have deep, deep client relationships, clients who rely on us for a package of
services, and that's not going away. And certainly, in this environment, this is an environment that's filled with
uncertainty, their need to constantly be engaging and repositioning and reshaping continues to make them very,
very active on a broad global scale.
I think that we've done a number of things to evolve the way we run the business over time that I think have made
the business more durable. Certainly, our focus and our emphasis on financing and the way we've grown and
managed the financing businesses puts a level of durability into the business that's different than when the
businesses were predominantly intermediation businesses. But intermediation continues to be an important
service. And when you really step back and you step out of quarter-to-quarter and you look more year-to-year or
year-over-year, these are very broad franchises across numerous silos and they tend to be more resilient and
more consistent than one might see when you look quarter-to-quarter.
So, we feel good about the way the franchise is positioned. We'll continue to invest in it and grow it. I think one of
the things that people forget is that these businesses are correlated to growth in the world. They're correlated to
market cap growth in the world. And as long as you believe over the medium and long-term those trends will
continue, with our capital generation, we have the ability to invest in those franchises and grow those franchises
over time. And we continue to see attractive return opportunities to do that. How the regulators respond to that
over time, I really think is a separate question. And we'll continue to be actively engaged, as we've said – as
we've said to you, we are to ensure that we can manage that appropriately.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
I appreciate that. This one will be a short follow-up. With – HPI was weak, but that'll happen on any given quarter.
I think if you look over a long period of time, you've earned good returns on your historical principal investments.
But as that book shrinks, the $10.9 billion that's left, the $4 billion attributed to it, if I take a – should I – is it okay to
take a historical ROE-ish on that capital to think about the lower revenue corresponding to the lower book going
forward on HPI?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So, Glenn, it's Denis. I guess what I would suggest you take a look at, we have obviously a commitment to
reducing the balance of the historical principal investments, and as we continue to have success doing that, there
will be less revenue associated with the positions that have now been moved off of the balance sheet. But you will
still see revenue generation associated with some of the co-invest positions that we retain as a piece of driving
our overall growth of our third-party fund management business. As to guidance on future projected returns on
that portfolio, I don't think I have a good answer as to exactly what future returns will be relative to prior returns.
But I would suggest to you that we have a very diversified portfolio of exposures and a long-standing track record
of delivering good returns for our clients.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I just had a follow-up first on trading, and maybe, David, would appreciate your perspective
around when we read about non-bank trading venues getting into fixed income markets, potentially sort of
disrupting the business for the incumbents. Comment on that if you could in terms of are there parallels to the
equity business that we should draw? And how much of a competitive threat are the non-bank/non-regulated
entities, especially given your comments around the regulatory backdrop and kind of the Basel Endgame
reproposal and the opaqueness around that? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. Sure, Ebrahim. And I appreciate the question. And this gets a lot of attention particularly in the press. But I
think there are a couple of things when you stand back that are important to think about. And look, the equities
journey is a relatively good journey. There's been lots of – first of all, there's lots of competition in all these
businesses. There's always been competition. But there are very few platforms that offer the leading capital
allocators and asset managers in the world the scale and the breadth across all the services that they need in an
integrated basis. And that's very, very important to those clients when you go out and you talk to those clients.
There can always be competition and there always will be competition. I'd just highlight our equity business is as
large and as scaled and as profitable as ever, even though over the last 25 years, there's been enormous
competition in the equity business, there's been digitization, there's been change. There are now a handful – and
by a handful, I'd say less than a handful. There are now one or two players that are trying to compete in some of
the credit spaces, et cetera.

And will they compete and will they win business? Of course, they'll win business. But these are big, big markets.
We offer scaled solutions that are integrated for our clients, and we continue to be enormous liquidity provider,
financier of those clients, which by the way is very, very important to them for the way their overall ecosystem
works. So, while these businesses always will be competitive and they continue to be competitive, again, we feel
very good about the way our franchise is positioned to continue to be a leading player for our clients in these
spaces.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Q
Poonawala
Analyst, BofA Securities,
Inc.
Understood. And then, just a follow-up on – back to ROE and conversation with investors around you all have
done a good job over the last year or two, performance has been strong. Stocks reflected that. As we think about
the journey here from a 12%, 13% ROE to something that's maybe 15%-plus, what are the building blocks? One
could argue that the market backdrop, not the best, but not the worst. What needs to happen for Goldman to get
to a point where we are registering a 15% type ROE on a more recurring basis? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Well, I appreciate the question. And we've been very clear. We have a mid-teens target and that we believe we
are on the journey of executing toward it. I think the first thing that has to happen is we need to continue to
execute over a period of time to deliver on that. And again, I think it's a pretty simple building block of a story.
First, we have a Global Banking & Markets business, and you can go look at the performance over the last five
years of that business and the returns that that business has delivered.
I would say that I still believe we have some tailwind dynamics around the investment banking activity. And I'd just
highlight that while investment banking revenues have improved and we've made progress, we are still not
operating at 10-year averages in M&A and equity volumes. M&A volumes year-to-date are 13% below 10-year
averages. Now, that's better than the 25% below 10-year averages that they were for the first nine months of last
year, and equity volumes at 27% below 10-year averages. Now, that's better than the 34%, 35% that they were
below 10-year averages for the first nine months last year. But there's no reason why we're not going to get back
to 10-year averages, and that's a tailwind. But you can look at the performance in Banking & Markets, and that's
one building block in the foundation for mid-teens returns.
The second is our continued progress which requires more time and more execution on our part around Asset &
Wealth Management. And while we've improved the margins, we still have work to do on the margins and also the
returns, and we continue to be very focused. But we are confident, over the course of the next few years, that we
can bring the returns of our Asset & Wealth Management franchise into the mid-teens.
The next building block or the last building block is we continue to narrow our consumer footprint and the drag
associated with the platforms – the platform business. That will get to a point where it basically becomes
negligible. It's getting closer to that. And so, if you put those building blocks together, Global Banking & Markets,
its actual performance was a little bit more of a tailwind, which obviously it benefits from. Continued progress on
Asset & Wealth Management. That is our business and we should be able to deliver those returns. We're focused
on it. We have more work to do. But that is the path and I think it's pretty clear.

Christian Bolu Q

Just another question on the trading business and the competitive landscape. How are you thinking about the –
maybe the broader competitive landscape with the – with other banks? Your market share seemed to peak in
2022. It's been a bit choppy since then as a market share. Just curious, are you seeing signs of competitors
coming back, increasing competition from anywhere? I'd just be curious on your thoughts there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
When you have leading market shares in our Global Banking & Markets franchise, you bounce around at different
levels based on short-term activity. But what I'd say is if you step back and you look over the last five years, we
took a step function up in our market shares broadly across the plot. And so, from quarter-to-quarter, you'll see
variability. But I still think those market shares are positioned in a leading position, and we're zealously focused on
them. We're zealously focused on the top 150 clients, which obviously make a huge contribution in the Markets
business. We're obviously always focused on our overall banking footprint and the opportunities there.
And obviously, in a better M&A environment where there's more large-cap M&A, you do see some movement in
our market shares, and that's a market share tailwind for us. They've always been competitive businesses,
Christian. Again, we think we're very well-positioned with our clients and have deep trusting long-term
relationships, and through our One Goldman Sachs operating ethos, a history of delivering for them through the
cycle. There's always going to be competition, but we like the way our business is positioned, and I don't see
anything that fundamentally changes that. But I've operated in these businesses – we've operated in these
businesses for a long time. They're always going to be competitive businesses.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christian Bolu Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Okay. Thank you. On private banking, just another set of very strong results there. I think revenue growth up 10%,
and if I'm doing my math correctly, organic flows are in the high single-digit range, which would put you, I think,
best-in-class. So, just remind us again like what's driving strength there and then maybe any key initiatives for
growth over the next couple of years that should help sustain this growth.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2024
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So, I'll start, and I don't know, Denis might have something to add. But on a high level, this is a strategic decision
that we had this big ultra-high net worth platform and we were underinvested in lending to those clients. And
there's a lot of historical reasons for why that's the case, starting with the fact that 15 years ago, we weren't a
bank. And so, we really didn't look at the world that way.
But lending into an ultra-high net worth franchise is a very good business and it's a very important part of the
business. And we understand and we've learned and we've seen it through investment banking and we've seen it
through Markets that when you holistically look at the integration of services that you provide to your clients
including lending, you improve your market share position.
So, when you look at our Wealth franchise versus other wealth franchises, we've been underpenetrated for
lending to those wealth clients, and we put in place resources, a leadership team and a focused effort to increase
that activity to these clients. And while we've moved the needle, we're still underweighted versus other
competitors like JPMorgan, and I would expect that we have a relatively good growth trajectory and continue to
invest in that capability for our client set. And Denis, I don't know if there's anything you want to add on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
The only thing I'd amplify, which I think we've mentioned before, we feel like we've run this play before. So, we
worked on a strategy to holistically cover clients in banking by integrating lending as part of the holistic suite of
services we provided them and improved our market share position with those clients. We've implemented the
same thing across the GBM Public businesses of FICC and equities.
We stand underpenetrated relative to peers today, and we believe that by taking the same holistic approach to
clients in the Wealth business that we can improve our market shares and the nature of our relationship with
those clients. As David said, we are allocating incremental resources, more specialist capabilities, and giving our

Hi. The first question relates to why do you still have Platform Solutions as a business line and what's happening
with the Apple Card? And do you plan to exit that and take charges for that and kind of what's going on with that?
Again, two-thirds of the firm's Global Banking & Markets, one-third is Wealth & Asset Management, and then you
have this kind of extra business there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks, Mike. I mean, I know there's a lot of focus on that. I think we've been pretty clear in our messaging
that we are continuing to narrow our consumer footprint. I don't have a lot more to say about where we are with
Apple Card other than we're running it, improving it, and that's really all that I have to say. But I think the direction
of travel at this point is pretty clear.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Well, back to the core business then, you said M&A is still 13% below 10-year averages. To what degree are 10-
year averages less relevant because of the sponsor activity? You guys have said – it seems like everyone has a
different number, whether it's $1 trillion or $3 trillion of dry powder out there, by sponsors that are ready, willing,
and able to pursue acquisitions. And I don't think you've ever had that level of dry powder before. So, could this
be an M&A supercycle because all that money gets put to work? And if so, how would you change that 10-year
average to adjust for that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Well, if – I mean, one, I think there are long-term secular trends around M&A and market cap, which by the way
are also meaningfully below trend. I think that's more driven by the current regulatory environment and the fact
that there has not been a lot of large-cap M&A with the market cap expansion especially around tech. That might
be permanent. It might not. But my guess is that will ebb and flow from time to time.
But your sponsor point, Mike, is a very, very good point. And the bottom line is the sponsors have been slower to
turn on than I would have expected, but they will turn on. By the way, if all that dry powder is deployed, okay,
M&A volumes versus the 10-year averages will go up. But by the way if we were sitting here 5 years ago, the 10-
year average was lower 5 years ago than it is today, because the 10-year average is definitely correlated to
market cap growth and economic growth.
So, I do think we'll operate at 10-year averages. I do think over time by the end of the decade, the 10-year
average will actually be higher than it's been with a historical lens. But I will say to your sponsor point, slower to
deploy than we would have expected, but we see more activity. Some of that is indicative of the growth in our
backlog that we've highlighted, and I do think that sponsor activity will continue to accelerate over the next 6, 12,
24 months.

Thank you.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yes. Okay. Super. Yeah. I totally agree. We've been calling for capital markets rebound, and it's really nice to see
it coming through. Two questions. One on the expanding loan offerings that you mentioned earlier, and I know we
touched on it briefly in the Q&A just a few questions ago. What I wanted to make sure I understood is when you
think about the RWA impact of reducing the private investments that you're doing, reducing that portfolio, and
then increasing the expanded loan offerings into Asset & Wealth Management, do you see that as RWA neutral?
Is the density of the loan offerings higher or lower than the investment – the private equity investments that you've
got?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. A
Coleman
Chief Financial Officer,
The Goldman Sachs
Group, Inc.
Sure, Betsy. Very good question. So, generally speaking, the density of the HPI that we have left to sell down is
high and the density of private wealth loans is low. So, migrating RWA deployment towards the lending
businesses improves the durability, the predictability, the recurring nature of it. It brings forth the holistic access to
the clients all of their – all their wealth management needs and it is more capital-efficient for us. So, that is...

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay, super. Right, because it's collateralized heavily, right? Okay. Then, the other question I had was just on the
GM credit. I want to make sure I understood this. So, as far as I can tell, it's signed but not closed yet. So, can you
give us a sense as to when you think it's going to close? And are there any trailers in your P&L once it does close,
for example, anything we should be aware of with regard to either payments on the contract to GM or is there like
a loss cap that you have to be involved in? I'm just trying to make sure I understand how to model this as we go
forward.

Sure, Betsy. So, in terms of timing, it's signed but not closed. There has to be a conversion to the new issuer and
then ultimately a closing of the platform transfer. Expectations, we're targeting Q3 of 2025. So, that's sort of timing
from a modeling perspective. And I guess what I would tell, we obviously have responsibility for operating the
platform up until that point in time. So, we will continue to incur, call it, the run-rate operating losses associated
with that business. As a guide, I'd point you to where we were in Q1 and Q2 of this year, something on the order
of negative $50 million or $60 million per quarter just to give you a sense for how that rolls forward from here till
closing.

Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up a little bit on the investment banking backlog
commentary. I know you said that advisory drove a lot of the growth in the backlog. But we did see some
sponsors recently come to the IPO market with some success. And so, curious about what you're seeing on the
ECM and IPO side, particularly as we see early signs of sponsors reengaging with that distribution channel.
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Yeah. So, thanks for the question, Brennan. I mean, there's no question equity activity picked up. But as I
highlighted a few moments ago, volumes are still running 25% below 10-year averages. And IPOs running even
more significantly below 10-year averages. I do think the sponsors – again, some of this is sponsor monetization,
and because sponsors have had their portfolios marked a little bit higher, they've been slow and they're kind of
waiting for growth to bring up some of the values. But I do see an acceleration of activity, and I expect it to
continue. And there's no fundamental reason why equity volumes ultimately shouldn't run at 10-year averages
and if those averages will grow over time with the growth in market cap and a growth in the deployment of
sponsor capital.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for that color, David. And then, we've seen several partnerships and some innovation getting
announced in the private credit world recently. Given your heritage in that business, how do you plan to approach
and prosecute that opportunity?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. We have a very broad and interesting credit platform that is integrated in a One GS way to some degree
and a differentiated way than many of the people we compete with. We obviously, as a credit originator in our
investment banking business, are one of the leading credit originators. We've had a leading position in leveraged
loans and high-yield debt for quite some time and a leading position with sponsors and the origination of that. We
obviously – we originate and distribute. We also – in our Asset Management business, we are a leading player in
private credit with $140 billion of private credit assets and growing and investing in that.
I think one of the things that's interesting when you look at the discussion and the integration of this around the
Street, there is plenty of capital that is interesting and deploying into private credit. The valuable part of the
ecosystem is origination channels. And there are obviously some private credit players that have interesting

origination channels and platforms. But I would say when you look across Goldman Sachs, our origination
ecosystem across both our Global Banking & Networks (sic) [Markets] business and also in our Asset & Wealth
Management business is unique and differentiated and something that I think will continue to differentiate the firm
as we continue to lean into and grow our private credit platform.

Good morning, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Wanted to spend some time just looking at or unpacking some of the self-help levers, recognizing that the
business is still burdened by capital consumption from some of the non-core assets, whether it's in consumer or
equity investments. Denis, I believe in your prepared remarks, you alluded to an 80 bps drag on ROE from
consumer, and was hoping you could maybe provide a more holistic picture. Just frame the drag on returns from
various non-core activities today, and are there any remaining self-help levers that could bolster returns which
may still be on the come?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. I think the 80 basis point drag is the simplest way to understand the impact of those items which we have
identified as the selected items, which we have announced we're in the process of disposing of. Obviously, if we
complete – if we were to completely exit all consumer-related activities, there would be more associated capital
relief potential. And we can obviously, across the AWM franchise, move down the vast majority of the HPI
exposure. That currently has a little over $4 billion of attributed equity associated with it. So, you have the
dynamic of sort of reducing the P&L components, and then over time, we will remove the capital. So, removing
the capital associated with HPI and then ultimately removing the capital associated with the consumer businesses
that will provide incremental tailwinds to us over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
That's great. And just for a follow-up on buybacks, just the stock is currently trading at 1.6 times book. It does
suggest some expectation in the market for returns to get closer to that mid-teens ROE target. Just wanted to
hear your perspective on price sensitivity to buyback at current valuation levels. And in anticipation at least of
David's response citing prioritization of organic growth, where do you see the most attractive opportunities to
deploy capital organically today?

Sure. So, I think our capital deployment philosophy unchanged. I think if you take some of our comments in the
prepared remarks about the outlook that we have, some of the engagement we're seeing from clients, potential
opportunities for the capital markets reopening to take the next step forward and see capital committed acquisition
financing, that is an activity that's very core to Goldman Sachs. We have a historical leading market share position
there, given, knitting up our advisory franchise and our underwriting capabilities. And so, that would be an
attractive place for us to deploy incremental capital.
Continuing to drive the recurring revenue streams across Wealth and the financing business and public is an
attractive place to deploy capital, and that is our priority as we sit here today with our 90 basis point buffer
heading into the fourth quarter. But we also remain very committed, as we've said before, to sustainably growing
our dividend. That's a core part of our philosophy, and we do believe it's important to also continue to return
capital to shareholders. We do have a higher valuation. We do think about that. We are sensitive to that. But I
don't believe that our current valuation is such that we shouldn't be also returning capital to shareholders.

Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, Citizens JMP Securities LLC
Thanks so much. Good morning, David and Denis. A question on just the alternative asset management
fundraising and looking at the fee rate. So, the largest alt bucket, corporate equity, has seen a declining fee rate
since the end of 2022. I know there were some legacy funds in there that are sun-setting. But it would just be
great to get an update on the outlook for the fee rate just given all that fundraising that you've done in alts in
recent years and just when we should think about the inflection occurring as recently raised AUM moves into fee-
earning and then how we should think about kind of the right steady state, because it would seem like there's a lot
of upside there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. Thank you. Appreciate the question. Obviously, we put that disclosure out there so you can track it and
follow it over time. It's obviously very much mix-dependent in terms of the nature of the particular alts assets that
are coming in. One thing which is a strategic initiative that is very valuable to growth of our Asset Management
franchise and important to a lot of our investment banking and other clients are the services we provide to our
OCIO offerings.
But in certain of those portfolios, we do bring onboard some alts assets and the effective fee associated with that
is lower than call it a Goldman Sachs Fund generated alternative fee. So, we have a multi-channel asset
accumulation strategy that we're deploying to grow the overall scale and scope of that business. And for us,
having scale is an important contributor ultimately to driving margins, efficiencies and returns in the business, but
not each of the channels comes with the same exact effective fee. So, you may see some slight variation in that
over time.

Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, Citizens JMP Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks, Denis. And then, just a follow-up on the trading business. Obviously, results have been incredibly
resilient and the firm is gaining market share. So, wanted to get a little bit of a flavor, if you can, just around how
much of trading revenue today is driven by your electronic trading capabilities and how that's evolved over the
past handful of years. I know there's been a lot of investment there, and you guys have some pretty differentiated

offerings. So, would just love to get a little bit of sense of that, and then how that plays into the story of market
share from here just as you become more relevant with clients. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. Thank you – thanks for the question. I mean, when you look at equity and frankly even FICC trading
activities, the strategy facing clients is multi-channel again. So, we have voice, we have high touch voice, and we
have electronic. And increasingly, we're finding ways to integrate those activities to optimize ultimately the way
that we can make markets and deliver solutions for clients. So, we have both run-rate, more plain vanilla
intermediation activities and then we have the capacity to either take onboard more interesting structured or
complicated trades with or without deployment of risk capital in the process, and the approach is to have a
distributed set of channels across the public side trading businesses.

Operator: Thank you. We'll go next to Dan Fannon with Jefferies.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel T. Fannon Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning. Denis, I want to come back to a comment you made about reiterating the $1 billion goal
for performance fees, and I think you said $4 billion of unrecognized gains. You're obviously run-rating well below
that here year-to-date. Can you talk about the time period you think to get to that $1 billion? And is there
seasonality with certain maybe liquid products that are typically more recognized in the fourth quarter or is this
something that should be more pro rata?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So, the $4 billion is versus the stock of outstanding funds that are in process of deploying, completing harvesting
and migrating their way to the end of their investment cycle. Given a lot of the other commentary that we've been
discussing about level of activity strategically, openness of capital markets, in particular equity capital markets,
sponsor monetization activity, et cetera, as it relates to our portfolio, where we own some balance sheet
investments and we own investments in funds, we have not had as much monetization in line with where the
market has been generally. So, as activity improves, we will also see more monetization, and we expect that over
the next several years, we will move towards those medium-term targets of a run-rate $1 billion worth of incentive
fees. But I can't tell you exactly the rate at which that comes in. That'll be dependent on how ultimately these
funds harvest and when we're in a position to ultimately pay carry to investors and recognize our own incentive
fees.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel T. Fannon Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got it. And then, just a follow-up on Wealth Management, understanding the strategy of growing lending. But can
you talk about the growth overall of the advisor base and how you're thinking about that over the next kind of one
to two years in terms of net recruiting hires, and ultimately investment in that business beyond just diversifying the
revenue streams?

Sure. So, I think we have made a strategic decision that the investment in advisors needs to be a strategic and
sustained investment program. So, rather than having it sort of ebb and flow across different market environments
or based on what the firm's perceived capacity to invest may or may not have been at different years in the past, I
think part of the strategy of investing in what is an really outstanding business at Goldman Sachs, where we're the
premier ultra-high net worth firm, we are making a sustained commitment to invest in advisors over multiple years.
And so, that is sort of a foundational underpinning of how we're looking to invest in that business. And when David
makes comments about our ability to drive growth and returns across AWM and that we are focused not just on
margins and returns but investing to grow, one of the places that we think is an attractive place to invest and grow
is actually in the advisor footprint.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi, Denis. Hi, David. Can you guys share with us – Goldman's in a unique position, I think, to be able to share with
investors the benefits of private credit. I think, David, you mentioned you have $140 billion in private credit assets.
And when you see your clients choosing a channel to access monies from you, whether it's private credit or just
lending, can you share with us the advantages that you see through private credit or the regular loan portfolio that
your customers may benefit from?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
So, I appreciate the question, Gerard. I think one of the things that's interesting about this is this gets framed in
very binary ways. And obviously, private credit is a broad term and it refers to a lot of things. It certainly refers to a
lot of investment-grade lending, a lot of which is on insurance company balance sheets. It can refer to direct
lending in the below investment-grade business, which by the way is a component of our syndication activity and
origination activity particularly with sponsors. It can be direct lending for small and medium-size enterprises. So,
there's a wide range of things.
When I listened to your question, what I pull away is you're asking in particular about leveraged finance activity
and how our clients choose channels in terms of where to get capital. And I'd say they don't go in with a bias.
They're actually looking for a capital structure that works for their particular solution. And I think that one of the
things that positions us well is we are a unique player that we have an ability to either syndicate and underwrite
and distribute. We have an ability to direct lend. We have an ability to show clients alternatives that can best meet
their needs, and their needs might be different in different transactional situations.
So, we like our positioning there. I do say that I believe, from a secular perspective, there'll be continued growth in
private credit, particularly in the leveraged finance space. And so, we're looking to capture that. But it's more
complicated. There are different channels. There's different origination efforts than sometimes the way this is all
portrayed. But we feel like we're well-positioned across the spectrum to be a significant participant in the space.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And David, just a quick follow-up on that. That was very thorough. Who do you find is your primary competitors?
Again, you're in a unique position, I think, to be able to benefit from this. Who do you bump into the most?

David Michael Solomon A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Well, it depends what you're doing. So, it goes back to exactly what I said. It depends what you're doing. If you're
in the leveraged finance market and you're looking at a syndicated capital structure and you're competing for that,
you're going to bump into JPMorgan, for example. If, on the other hand, you're looking at direct lenders, then
you're going to bump into a bunch of people that play a leading role in that space, which can include people like
HPS or Ares or other direct platforms. If you're looking at investment-grade insurance company balance sheet,
you might run into Apollo. I mean, it really depends on who the client is, what their need is and what the activity is.
And it's actually quite a broad and complicated space.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
And the only thing I'd add to it, Gerard, if you just think about it – I think David's laid this out really well. If you think
about where Goldman Sachs is positioned against this opportunity set, we have capacity to lend to alternatives
clients for example, who are deploying into the private credit space. We have the capacity to underwrite and
distribute different types of investment-grade and non-investment-grade capital structures, and we have the
capacity to offer investment opportunities to clients who want to get exposure to this asset class. And while we
compete with all of those different parties that David enumerated, I'm hard-pressed to find many people that have
the breadth of exposure to each aspect of this ecosystem relative to us. So, we really like our position in terms of
the secular trends there and how we can support clients in each and every aspect of the continuum.

Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Saul Martinez with HSBC.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, HSBC Securities (USA), Inc.
Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the margin trajectory in Asset & Wealth Management. Year-to-date,
you're at – you've got a 24% pre-tax margin. You've already essentially reached the mid-20% medium-term
target. I know you talked about that margin expanding beyond the mid-20s. But how do we think about where it
can ultimately land and the time horizon around it? Obviously, you're growing your alts business. You have $4
billion of unrecognized incentive fees. You talked about the private banking and lending platform. Just can you get
to a pre-tax margin of above 30% like your peers, and again, how do we think about the glide path from here and
the time horizon around that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Denis P. Coleman A
Chief Financial Officer, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.
Sure. Thank you, Saul. So, obviously, we've just arrived at our mid-20s target. I think it's important that we
consolidate our position there. We think there are plenty of opportunities to continue to drive that margin higher as
we scale top line, as we improve the mix of alternatives across our platform, and we look to drive other operating
efficiencies across the business segment. There are plenty of competitors that have margins, as you cite, that are
30% or higher. So, our commitment is to continue to improve the margins. But we're also thinking increasingly
about opportunities we have to scale and create value for the long-term. So, we are going to try and find the
balance between incremental margin improvement and making the right investment decisions that unlock long-
term value in this segment. But for the time being, we think that both can be achieved.

Okay, got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, maybe if I could follow up on capital and just how you're thinking – I
know you talked about your capital strategy a bit. But how are you thinking about just capital allocation and
buybacks given the uncertainty around Basel? We have the proposal. We have the speech outlining a reproposal.
We have an agency that seemingly – one of the agencies obviously resisting seemingly the reproposal. We have
an election that could play a big role in terms of influencing whatever outcome happens. So, just how are you
thinking about your capital and why do you think the 90 basis point buffer is the right buffer given all that
uncertainty?

Okay. Thank you. Look, what I – I would say for the last period of quarters and years, we've been operating in an
environment with a bunch of regulatory uncertainty. There's also been operating uncertainty as well. I think the
economic trajectory outlook and client franchise is coming more into focus. Frankly, that presents opportunities.
So, we run a buffer so that we have pent-up capacity to support incoming client opportunities. But we also run the
buffer given other uncertainties in the world, which include regulatory.
As to when we will have the next bit of clarity and be able to interpret exactly what that means for our capital
position, I couldn't tell you right now. But we have a long history of making adjustments to our activities when we
get that regulatory feedback. From everything we know, there are generally timelines associated with those rules
coming into effect, and we feel like this is the right place to run our capital to support the client franchise and be
prepared for other unexpected developments, including regulatory.

Operator: Thank you. At this time, there are no additional questions. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the
Goldman Sachs third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now
disconnect.
