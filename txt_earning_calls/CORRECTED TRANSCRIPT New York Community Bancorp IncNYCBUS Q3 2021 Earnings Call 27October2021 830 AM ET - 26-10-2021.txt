Q3 2021 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2021
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Salvatore J. DiMartino
Managing Director & Director-Investor Relations & Strategic Planning, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, everyone. This is Sal DiMartino. Thank you for joining the management team of New York
Community for today's conference call. Today's discussion of the company's third quarter 2021 results will be led
by Chairman, President, and CEO, Thomas Cangemi, joined by Chief Operating Officer Robert Wann, and the
company's Chief Financial Officer, John Pinto.

of New York Community may include forward-looking statements within the meanings of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements we may make are subject to the Safe Harbor

With that, now I would like to turn it over to Mr. Cangemi.

Thomas Robert Cangemi
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Sal. Good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter 2021
performance. In addition to Robert and John also joining on the line are Sandro DiNello, President and CEO of
Flagstar; and Lee Smith, President of Flagstar Mortgage. As you may have already seen, Flagstar reported third
quarter results today as well, which were also very strong. Before launching into a discussion about third quarter
results I would like to provide you with a brief update on a pending merger with Flagstar. As you know, both sets
of shareholders overwhelmingly approved the planned merger in early August. At this point, it appears that
regulatory approval will not be received in time to close the merger during the fourth quarter. We now estimate an
anticipated closing as soon in 2022 as we can obtain regulatory approval. In the interim, both banks continue to
work closely together and we are making significant progress on the integration and planning front. Both sides are
looking forward to consummating the merger and creating a top tier regional banking franchise with significant
size and scale across multiple business lines, as well as providing a comprehensive line of commercial and retail
banking offerings to all customers across our footprint.
Moving now to our results. Early this morning, we announced third quarter 2021 diluted earnings per share of
$0.30 a share, up 30% compared to the third quarter of last year. Excluding merger-related expenses totaling $6
million, diluted EPS was $0.31 a share on a non-GAAP basis, up 35% year-over-year. For the first nine months of
2021, we reported diluted EPS of $0.90 a share, up 43%, compared to $0.63 a share for the same period last
year. On a non-GAAP basis, we reported $0.93 a share, up 47% compared to the first nine months of 2020. Both
of these metrics are the best diluted EPS we have reported for the first nine months since 2010. This was another
solid quarter for the company, highlighted by higher year-over-year pre-provision net revenue, continued margin
expansion, strong deposit growth, stable operating expenses and solid credit quality. Total loan growth was
modest but the multi-family segment increased 4% on an annualized basis compared to the previous quarter.
Turning now to the details of our performance, our pre-provision net revenues rose 19% to $198 million compared
to the year ago quarter. Excluding merger-related expenses, PPNR rose 22% to $204 million compared to the
third quarter of last year. The net interest margin came in at 2.44%, down 6 basis points compared to the second

quarter of the year, but up 15 basis points on a year-over-year basis. The linked quarter decline was primarily due
to a decline in pre-payment income from very strong levels during the previous quarter.
Prepayment income for the third quarter totaled $60 million and added 12 basis points to the margin. In contrast,
last quarter's prepayments totaled $27 million and added 20 basis points to the margin. Excluding the impact from
prepayments, the margin on a non-GAAP basis increased 2 basis points sequentially to 2.32% and 12 basis
points compared to the prior year.
Moving on now to deposits, we continue to make significant progress on the deposit front, both in increase in the
level of core deposits while decreasing the percentage of higher core CDs. Total deposits grew $444 million, or
5% annualized compared to the previous quarter. This reflects growth in both our banking as a service business,
which was launched earlier this year, and continued success in gathering deposits from our commercial
borrowers. Banking as a service deposits totaled $1.4 billion at the end of the third quarter, all of which are non-
interest-bearing accounts. We've had several wins since we launched this initiative early in the year. In addition to
previously disclosed relationship with our technology partner, the company is actively responding to requests for
proposals from states for banking services and/or reloadable benefit card solutions.
To date, we have been awarded the banking service agreement for the New Jersey Department of Labor and will
be the bank supporting the reloadable benefit costs for the State of Rhode Island. These are just the first
relationship we have signed, and we are encouraged by the early success of our initiative and by the number of
pending relationships we have in our pipeline. In addition to banking as a service deposit growth, [ph] we also
(00:05:32) was driven by the increase in deposits from our multifamily commercial real estate borrowers. These
loan-related deposits totaled $4.2 billion at the end of the third quarter, up $652 million since the beginning of the
year and $265 million during the quarter. On the expense front, our operating expenses continue to be well
contained. Excluding merger-related expenses of $6 million, operating expenses totaled $129 million, unchanged
compared to both the previous quarter and the third quarter of last year. Our efficiency ratio of 39% remains
strong as well.
On the lending side, while total loans held for investment increased $112 million compared to the previous
quarter, total loans increased $858 million on a year-over-year basis. Despite the modest overall loan growth, we
had good growth in the multi-family segment. The multi-family portfolio increased nearly $300 million, or 4%
annualized compared to the previous quarter, partially offset by declines in the other segments. On a year-over-
year basis, multi-family loans have risen $738 million. Our pipeline heading into the end of the year is robust. It
currently stands at $1.9 billion, the second highest level of the year, and it's a reminder we always originate much
more than we traditionally have in our pipeline.
As for our credit quality, our credit metrics remains solid and continue to rank among the best in the industry. Non-
performing assets declined compared to the second quarter levels and at $37 million represents 6 basis points of
total assets, while we had no charge-offs in the quarter. Additionally, principal deferrals declined 8% to $914
million compared to the previous quarter, while full payment deferrals remained at zero. Compared to the third
quarter of last year, total deferrals are down $4.9 billion or 84% compared to $5.8 billion in the third quarter of last
year. During the quarter, loans 30 to 89 days past due increased to $447 million, practically all of which was
related to one borrower and consist of several multi-family and mixed use properties. All of the delinquencies are
in the 30 day bucket. We are working with the borrower [ph] who's (00:07:45) taking advantage of our CARES Act
loan modification program. The loans have an original weighted average LTV of 57%, and the bank is well
secured. Therefore we do not expect to incur any losses on this relationship.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2021
Before moving on, I'd like to take a few moments to comment on the New York City economy. Four of the city-side
boroughs have been doing very well since early this year. Now Manhattan is coming back as the reopening gains
momentum. Schools and businesses have reopened, restaurants are open and allowed to operate at 100%
capacity, Broadway reopened last month and tourism has increased. While not fully back to normal, Manhattan is
definitely on the path to normalization. The Manhattan residential real estate market has rebounded strongly,
while a segment of the market, the non-luxury rental regulated multifamily market has proven to be very stable.
Lastly, during the quarter, we announced our investment and entered into a partnership with Figure Technologies,
one of the leading fintech companies focused on payments systems and learning via the blockchain technology.
We are very excited about this partnership and believe it will support our strategic initiatives as I outlined earlier
this year.
With that, we would be happy to answer any questions you may have. We will do our very best to get to all of you
within the time remaining. But if we don't, please feel free to call us later today or during the week. Operator,
please open the line for questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming
from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Ebrahim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Good morning, Tom. I guess just first on credit, so obviously you mentioned you don't expect any
losses tied to the NPA increase. But give us some sense of when did you anticipate that this was coming down
the pike over the last few months and should we expect more of these – some of these deferrals roll off and
customers take like actual assessment of where things stand cash flow-wise?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, Ebrahim, so obviously we have a long stated history of very rarely having any delinquencies.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So clearly we don't anticipate something like this, but obviously we feel very comfortable on the level of LTV that
we have on [ph] originally (00:10:09) via this particular cluster of loans. We're very confident that we are working
closely with the borrower and we feel confident that by the end of the year he will be in a status of current. So
again, we feel highly confident that we're in a good position here. We don't anticipate because historically we get

paid on all our loans, so this is not something that we anticipated at all. However, we are working very closely with
our customer and we feel highly confident that he'll be current by the end of the year.
As far as overall, if – and I would categorize it just to be specific, this is all Manhattan-based property. So I believe
when you think about the boroughs, when we talked about – my comments upfront about the five boroughs,
Manhattan is definitely coming back very, very strongly, in particular in the multi-family rent regulated and non-
luxury marketplace. So clearly we're seeing a supply and demand situation where there's not enough supply and
there's tremendous demand for it on the housing side. So we feel highly confident since these are blended
buildings, some of them are mixed use, some of them is just pure rentals, but feel highly confident as he has to
re-up his lease as they're coming into the market, which is significantly higher when they were during the
pandemic.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Understood. Okay. And I guess just moving on to the margin, when we think about the core NIM, I think you
guided for 3 to 5 bps adjusted for a couple of bps last quarter I think you said in the middle of that. Just talk to us
in terms of how much more margin expansion is there to go as you think about funding cost leverage? And also
you made some pretty decent banker hirings on the deposit size during the quarter. Just give us, if you can, a
framework around how big that loan interest-bearing bucket can get over the next few quarters, next year. And
what mix do you think just organically ex-Flagstar that could look like as we think about the next year or so?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, Ebrahim, obviously ex-Flagstar, this division of deposit gathering is significantly changed [ph] here the
company (00:12:08). Effective January 1, it was focusing on gathering core deposits, focusing on working with our
customers, getting our operating accounts in line when we close these loans and it's working. It's a cultural shift
that's working and we're seeing good success on that. In addition to that, as I indicated, we are very actively
pushing banking as a service, as a product line here. And we have resources behind that and we are seeing the
results of that. And in my prepared remarks we won some nice, unique business throughout the quarter, but
throughout the year it's been growing very nice. I think we're all close to $2 billion as of today, so it's growing very
nicely and the pipeline is building. So I think when you think about that type of money, it's traditionally zero cost,
very stable and non-interest-bearing. So I think that's a solid book of business.
What we want to do obviously on a standalone basis is build a better core funding base when we look at our
company and be less dependent on wholesale funding. So we think these initiatives both on the commercial side
is key as well as building out a line of business such as banking as a service and utilize our balance sheet to
gather more liabilities that are more stable than the non-traditional wholesale mechanism to fund the business. So
we're pretty excited about that. I'm not going to give deposit growth as far as for next year because obviously
when you put Flagstar and NYCB together, it's significant because they have a tremendous amount of liquidity
that they don't need right now. Given that they use the funds, we will be very powerful on combination in respect
to total funding based on a blended basis, so we're excited about that opportunity. But on standalone basis that is
the strategy right now and we're seeing very good results throughout the year. And we're continuing to focus on
the cultural shift on mandating the operating accounts, we secure the deposits when we close our loans and that's
a priority for us.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2021
Sure. And outlook for the margin, Tom?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Again, I think we're getting to a point now where our CD costs are probably [indiscernible] (00:14:02) within [ph]
40 to 45 (00:14:03) basis points.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So you're not going to see much on the CD side. I would say that you're probably going to be in line with what we
saw last quarter, a couple of basis points per quarter of margin expansion ex the combination of Flagstar. But with
Flagstar combined and going into next year as we [ph] reposition ourselves for (00:14:20) interest rate risk,
continued margin expansion. So, clearly, we're confident that the cost of funds will continue to go lower, albeit
smaller. However, as the yield curve starts to steepen here, we have an opportunity to deploy a lot of liquidity and
we're sitting on a lot of cash, right. So we're not buying assets and we believe this quarter should be the highest
quarter for growth. We have a very strong pipeline. In addition to the close to $2 billion of the pipeline that we
have, we have a significant amount of [ph] apps (00:14:47) that are in the pipeline. So I would envision the fourth
quarter being the highest growth quarter of the year for net loan growth, which should help the margin as well.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2021
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah. Tom, just to follow up on those comments on loan growth, just talk about the fourth quarter, your comfort
level with the mid-single digit guide, I think we all were expecting fourth quarter pickup that you could just kind of
frame that out a little bit more?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So the good news is the pipeline. As you can see, the numbers are public. It's one of the strongest pipelines
we've had through the year. We have a lot of loans that [ph] we're apping (00:15:35) up right now that's in process
for approval. So we feel pretty good about where we are in respect to the momentum. We're going into November
here and then we see the growth which is favorable. So we will have a growth, net loan growth quarter. I think
what was somewhat of a disappointment is that when the specialty finance business and it sounds like a cliche,
but when you think about the supply chain, that does impact our book of business, right. So we have probably an
extra $1 billion of commitments that are not being drawn down because the customers that are in that portfolio,
these are all A, AA-type credits are [ph] not (00:16:07) drawing down on the line.
So clearly that's where we're sitting there with great opportunity. However, the supply chain is having impact on
the specialty finance book. So typically the specialty finance book has been growing around 20% on average. I
think our CAGR is close to 25% since we put it in inception. So this is probably the worst year we had since we
started the business, and that's a 10% net growth, which is not terrible given the environment. We think that could
pick up assuming there is some release on the supply chain as we go into the fourth quarter. That's the unknown,
so we add that first, a very strong commercial borrowing opportunity here, both on multi-family and also on the
commercial side we feel pretty optimistic that we will have growth absent changes in the supply chain. If the
supply chain starts to ease up a little bit, then the growth will be stronger.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And just a question for Lee, you mentioned he was on the call. Flagstar gain on sale looked very
strong this quarter. If you could just break down how much of that was EBO and any Q4 guide you wish to
provide, that would be helpful?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Matthew Smith A
Executive Vice President & President-Mortgages, Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, sure. This is Lee. Well, first of all, we're very pleased with our Q3 mortgage results. We guided to $160
million to $180 million and we came in at $169 million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Matthew Smith A
Executive Vice President & President-Mortgages, Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.
About [ph] $18 million (00:17:26) of that was EBO. And I think the strong earnings was in large part due to our
diversified mortgage model, and we saw 5% more retail [ph] locks (00:17:36) in Q3 versus Q2 as a percentage of
overall originations. And retail is a higher margin channel, and we executed on five RMBS deals in the quarter,

which made us the second largest RMBS issuer in the quarter behind Chase. We also kept costs under control.
Mortgage costs actually declined $6 million quarter-on-quarter. And mortgage expense as a percentage of close
loan volume declined from 1.02% to 1.00%. So we feel good about the flexibility and optionality our model affords
us, together with the good cost control and discipline we execute with. Looking into Q4, we're guiding to $120
million to $140 million gain on sale. The main reasons for the decline in Q4 versus Q3 are just normal seasonality,
and we're seeing that in the agency and MBA volume forecasts. The Fed tapering discussions have increased
bond yields and mortgage rates, and we have seen a slight compression in primary/secondary spreads.
And then the FHFA reversal of certain PSPA provisions was a slight negative to us, given we're a bank and an
aggregator. We were able to step into the void that the GSCs will leave in and then we're planning on three RMBS
deals in Q4 versus the five that we executed on in Q3, and we're planning on executing on six in Q1 2022. As we
look further forward into 2022, the agency and MBA forecasts are saying it's going to be a $3 trillion market in
2022, $2.5 trillion market in 2023, any time the market's over $2 trillion that's healthy. As I mentioned, we're
planning on six RMBS deals in Q1 and we'll continue to leverage that program, utilize our diversified mortgage
model and find pockets of opportunities. We have the balance sheet which gives us the [ph] HFS (00:19:40), HFI
and MSR flexibility and that RMBS program gives us execution optionality. Finally, with the bigger balance sheet
as a result of the merger, it gives us growth opportunities across all of our sales channels, across the HFI portfolio
products, holding more MSRs which benefit us from a deposit point of view, the RMBS program as I've mentioned
and supporting the 238 NYCB branches and customers. As I've said before, we're trying to generate more
consistent and predictable mortgage earnings using all the levers that I've just discussed that we have at our
disposal.

Hey, good morning, guys. Hey, you already highlighted a number of positives on the Flagstar quarter that was
pretty impressive. I noticed the warehouse was also up nicely, and that bucked the trend, a lot of the banks out
there. So just any comments on that front would be great? And if you can just remind us everything that's done
prior to the close of the deal here to really hit the ground running on day one post the close? On the warehouse
front, I know you've reached out to a lot of your top accounts to let them know that larger lines could be available.
So if you just talk about that, and then I know on the deposit side, you really haven't targeted that pool of deposits.
Maybe size what that opportunity is there, that would be great.

Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, that question is directed to Lee Smith, or Sandro?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alessandro P. DiNello A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, let me – this is Sandro, let me take it. Yes. So we've just been executing in the fashion that we told you that
we would and that was number one to continue to expand our relationships and take more market share as the
mortgage market itself shrinks and we've been successful in doing that. One of the ways we're doing that ex the
anticipated merger is to do more syndications on the Flagstar side, where we're leading opportunities with bigger
organizations, taking bigger positions and then sharing them with other banks. And then as we do think about the
upcoming merger, while still staying within our loan concentration limits, which we've always been very
conservative and disciplined around, as the market itself shrinks rather than just lose relationships or levels of
outstanding in terms of amounts drawn on line, what we're doing is expanding relationships with our best
customers, because we're more comfortable taking larger positions with them.
Again, as I said, still staying within our conservative and disciplined concentration levels, both in terms of the
overall size of the warehouse portfolio, as well as on individual credit basis. So it's just really what we've been
doing for a long time here for the last five, seven years as we've focused on growing the warehouse business,
taking advantage of the opportunities, doing it well from a service perspective and getting paid fairly for what we
do. And as a result of that, the business has held very strong and we're very optimistic about it being able to
continue with that kind of strength going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Maybe Lee, do you want to talk about the deposit initiatives tied to the Flagstar portfolio given the potential
business combination?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Matthew Smith A
Executive Vice President & President-Mortgages, Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So as it relates to the servicing or subservicing business, there's a lot of custodial deposits tied to that. And
just given the size of our balance sheet, we have excess custodial deposits that we've put with other institutions.
Given the merger, we're able to bring those custodial deposits back given we're going to have the bigger balance
sheet and so that's going to be an advantage from a funding point of view. And then just having a bigger balance
sheet, I think given the relationships we have with MSR funds, with warehouse borrowers, it gives us the
opportunity to go and bring in more deposits than we've been able to with the smaller balance sheet. So we think
that is going to be another big advantage of this combination and having a $90 billion balance sheet.

Alessandro P. DiNello A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Just to expand on the reference Lee made to warehouse customers, we do not seek escrow deposits from
warehouse customers, because we just don't need them. We do have regular deposit relationships with our

warehouse customers and that's relatively significant, but the opportunity to take in escrow deposits is it's hard for
me to estimate what that is, but I know that it's significant, because it's never been something that we've needed
to do. But we are telling our warehouse customers that we will be in a position to show some interest in that post-
merger. But it's really difficult for me to tell you how much. But I do think it's meaningful, if that's helpful.

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah. Yeah. I appreciate that. Thanks for the color there. And then, Tom, I got one for you. Just on the multi-
family side of things. I know historically you've seen your borrowers coming back to the banks to refinance when
the five year jumps and there's an expectation that will keep going higher. We've heard that from you guys, we've
heard from other banks and from brokers that we talk to in the market as well. Are you seeing any start of that,
any sign of that at this point? And if not, what do you expect you would need to see in that five-year moving higher
to start seeing that kind of concern amongst your borrowers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Okay, that's a great point. This is clearly a change in the shape of the curve. The back end has moved up
considerably [ph] and the five years has (00:26:00) also gravitated higher. This is actually great for our business
because the decision to go agency versus portfolio makes it more towards the portfolios, which is favorable.
We're seeing that. So I would say with conviction that we are getting more opportunity to be more competitive
there. And I think on the rate side, you're at higher levels. So I think this is going to get people focused in respect
to the next financing alternative that usually is a relatively short asset. If the tapering does take place, it does have
an impact on the back end of the curve as well as the value of the curve. It will be very favorable for our business.
We see some good property transactions occurring in the five boroughs, which is very favorable.
We also see various what we call seasoned players not exiting but expanding their operations into new
demographics that we're following. So that's also going to be part of our growth. So we're very bullish about this
pandemic hopefully coming to a better place and seeing Manhattan out and about and the foot traffic is
significant. We think this is going to bode into a significant opportunity as the customers that are on the spotlight
will have to make decisions. These are short-dated assets, they're not long-dated assets, and it seems that we'll
see more and more of the traditional five-, seven-year type stuff coming out when rates start to rise here. So we're
very optimistic there.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2021
Hi, great, thanks. Good morning, Tom. In terms of the deal getting pushed out just a little bit towards first quarter,
can you just talk about like what are the regulators looking for or asking for or just any kind of color behind why
this seems to be getting pushed just a little bit? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Hi. I would just be very clear, in my opening remarks it's very clear, it's in a position that it's with our regulators,
we're waiting for approval, we're very optimistic about the merger. However, it's in regulatory hands, so we clearly
are working towards our common goal of getting this transaction closed as soon as possible. As you know, we
can't specifically discuss what we do with our regulators. So obviously, it's in the hands of regulatory process.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Understood. I thought I'd ask, nonetheless. I guess my second question...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
...We appreciate the question, but as you can imagine, it is what it is.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah, I know. I understand. Just come back to that, that large borrower in Manhattan, I get that you're very well
secured. Obviously, really low LTVs, but can you just provide a little more color like why is he having problems at
this point, because obviously the New York market is coming back [indiscernible] (00:28:39)...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
...so yeah, I'll give you very specific. We were very generous from day one with the CARES Act, and many
customers took out of an abundance of caution that relief. He was one of the few customers that did not take
relief. He was paying all through the depths of the pandemic, which really could have bolstered his balance sheet.
That decision was made, and obviously when you look back, he probably at least thought at a lower level to
realize that the pandemic was worse than he expected. And the end result is that he needs relief now. And
ultimately, as you know, we don't typically have loans that go past 30 days and these are low leverage type
properties, and we could sell the notes in a very short order and be out of this relationship. But we're very
comfortable given the CARES Act relief that we've provided to him and the fact that we have an ongoing dialogue
and we feel highly confident that he will be in a current position by the end of the year. So again, it is what it is. It's
unfortunate that he did not take advantage of what the bank had offered. Many of our customers did by the way
and literally during the phase of the first six months of no pay, they came back and saw the [ph] paying
(00:29:41). They didn't want to put the money in the back end. So I think he's one of the few customers who did
not take advantage of the CARES Act early on and the good news is that when you look at where the market is
and these leases that are coming back for renewal, they're going to be much higher than they were when we
leased them out in the middle of the pandemic. These are not long dated leases. So we're highly confident that
we'll be in a good position here.

Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Chris.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, everyone. I want to follow up on the deposit growth that you've seen, particularly the non-
interest bearing that you cite with the banking as a service. I guess maybe I missed this, but expectations for non-
interest-bearing deposits to continue to grow, I think there's a view in the market that most banks will not see as
much growth in non-interest-bearing given the move up in rates and kind of some parked money, but interested in
your thoughts specific to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So Chris, this is the type of deposit we focus on. This is pre-loaded card business. It's very sticky. It's
driven off of some of the stimulus payments that are out there, including the new ones that are coming, who
knows what's coming in the future. So these are interesting programs the technology provided. So the technology
out there that does play in the space need to have a bank behind them on a [ph] win perspective (00:31:00) when
you deal with tying into your system, so we are providing that. We are also looking at putting our own request for
proposals throughout the country for that business. And it's not just in the local area, it's throughout the country.
So we're very active on expanding that. But I also want to be very clear, we've spent some real effort here and
brought in some new people on banking as a service and focusing on technology initiatives, which will result in us
probably having some technology wins with companies that are in the space that are challenger banks, US banks
that have access to substantial funding, but they're not FDIC insured. So we will use our balance sheet to be able
to enjoy the opportunity to provide insured deposits that I believe the marketplace will be requiring to have when
you deal with some of these challenger bank situations. And a lot of those players are smaller players that are
capped out at $10 billion for Durbin reasons on the fee side, and we can partner with them. So we are fairly
focused on that. We think it's going to be a significant potential for the bank. I'm not going to give a number on it
but we're right where we started at zero, now we're $2 billion. It's only been around 10 months. So that's a pretty
good track record and we have so many opportunities in the pipeline that we're bullish about.
Now you're not going to win every one and you're not [ph] doing (00:32:19) every request for proposal, but we are
reaching out to some major challenger players out there and not in any partners in the marketplace to house this
liquidity event and we're willing to work with them. And in addition to that, we're also focusing on a planning
perspective with Flagstar to use this escrow opportunity as a tremendous way to structure term. We've done this
before. When we had the mortgage business, we had structured term where some of the large players that we've
done business on a conduit basis were structuring out very cheap cost – low cost deposits in a term perspective.
And they were comfortable going out more than just a – we'll call it a short-term position, were taking a longer
term position with us as a partnership. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it. And we kind of classify the

[ph] doing (00:33:04) banking as a service as well as we continue to drive into the technology initiatives that's out
there. We think they'll pay dividends for us. And by the way, this is a strategy of the bank. This is focusing on
better funding the balance sheet as we change the dynamic of the company.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
No, that's great. Thank you for that color. Just – I want to follow-up on just overall rate sensitivity, given the
markets, the move-up in rates. Could you help us with kind of a longer term, it seems like there's a funding
advantage when Flagstar comes on? And I know when the deal was announced, you talked about the balance
sheet being better positioned, but if we [ph] take out (00:33:42) the market pricing in a couple of hikes by the end
of next year into 2023, how should we think about margin development pro forma developing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So let me start off, and I'll just say big picture and I'll hand it over to Mr. Pinto. Big picture is that NYCB in
combination with Flagstar, they are asset sensitive, liability sensitive for the most part. They're mostly an
adjustable rate type lender. We're mostly fixed. When you blend that we are in a very good position to manage
very well. That's the big picture, and that's part of the merits of the transaction. We feel highly confident when
these companies come together, the balance sheet has a very different position on interest rate risk. That being
said, I'll have Mr. Pinto just go dive into some of the details on a standalone basis where we stand.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, I mean, as you know, on a standalone basis we have been and continue to be liability sensitive. But on the
NII side, that has begun to change a little bit and moderate. But as Tom mentioned, that's been moderating
because of the potential deposits we can bring in on the non-interest-bearing side and limit our reliance on
wholesale funding, right? That's the goal, to continue to take that $15 billion of wholesale borrowings and pay it
down when we can with core deposits. So that will be the big generator for us to continue to limit the liability
sensitive nature of our standalone balance sheet. And until we're close to Flagstar, where that NII sensitivity turns
to more of a positive perspective, given the amount of floating rate loans and the asset structure at Flagstar.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So I would just add to John's point. If you think about the fourth quarter, we have about $370 million coming due
from a wholesale position. That's at a cost of $257 million. That's pretty expensive in this environment. I mean,
you go out, let's say the full year 2022 is another $2 billion, that's just about 1.5%. It's still considered very
expensive in this environment. And when you go out to 2023, it's $3 billion at about 1%. So on blended we have
an opportunity here to take advantage of a much lower rate environment. We believe there will be probably some
changes in the year ahead, but not enough to really take away the opportunity to restructure or revalue, reposition
that close to $5.5 billion. We know what's coming due in the quarter and that will probably get paid off with cash.
So we have zero cost money that will pay off the $257 million. When you think about 2022 and 2023, when you
think about the business combination with Flagstar, the opportunity to look at the entire liability book on a holistic
basis is clearly to our advantage. So we're excited about that opportunity. We think there's going to be real value
there. We haven't put a number on it yet, nor will we until we close the transaction. But clearly, we think it's a
great opportunity.

Thomas Robert Cangemi A

The way our structure is, we're [ph] in an FDIC state (00:36:21), so we have not received our FDIC and state

Good. So first, regarding the past dues and the $377 million relationship, how many other relationships do you

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2021
So we do not have a – well, I'm not going to disclose my house limit, but we do have large relationships. And
we've been doing that as part of our business model. I think the good news about that as we start building this
mandate on the deposit side, we're seeing the growth in our deposits from these long-term large relationships. But
now clearly going back to that one specific customer, I'm going to say it again, we feel very confident that we'll be
current by the end of the year and more importantly we have adequate collateral to deal with it for some reason.
We're not in a position at the end of the year to be current. So we feel pretty good about it. But clearly, and Steven
you know the business model, we deal with significant families throughout the five boroughs as well as expanding
outside of the five boroughs now for a number of reasons, and we're very comfortable with our relationship
lending.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. Tom, on the margin, so regarding the sizable decline in the prepayment penalty fees in the
quarter, was that attributable just to rates moving up a bit and do you expect to see refinance activity further slow?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Again, Steven, and again, rate does make a difference, though if there is a real steepness in the curve, I think
many customers will react, they've been enjoying a relatively low coupon as they make their decisions and
obviously with the pandemic that have slowed things down considerably. It seems like there's a pick up here.
We're hearing about transactions. There are many, many players on the sidelines with significant liquidity looking
to buy assets and the math does, it's still compelling. The math is a double-digit return if bought right with cap
rates that are holding up between 4.5% to 5.5%. So I think at the end of the day, I think you're really looking at a
market that's ripe for a rebound, assuming that Manhattan has a stronger recovery. I will be very clear. The five
boroughs, the last frontier is Manhattan. We're seeing significant positive movement there. We are seeing our
customers. I will tell you with conviction, there are deals in the pipeline that are purchased as well as refi. But I
think if rate moves here, given the tapering that's potentially out there and as well as a theory that rates are going
to be higher, that will make customers rethink about their opportunities and probably come to the table sooner,
which would generate not only pre-payment income but also potential loan growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yes. Okay. That's helpful. And finally, Tom, could you give color on the decline in the security yields in the quarter
was off quite a bit quarter-over-quarter? And then just from a spot rate view, where are new loans and securities
going in today? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So we really haven't been buying any securities for a while, John, was that right? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. And you've seen the balance just continue to kind of drop quarter-over-quarter and that's just some of the
higher-yielding securities coming off. The home loan bank has lowered its rate slightly over the – when you look
quarter-over-quarter as well. And there were also in the – if you remember in the second quarter, we had
significant pre-payment fees on our securities portfolio as well. So that's what's generating the actual top line miss
when you look at exposed prepaid, it's not down anywhere near as much, but we are still seeing some pressure

there, right ? We're trying to limit security purchase this year to avoid putting on duration in this interest rate
environment. And that's why we'll be sitting on a little extra cash for the time being until we're ready to put some of
that money to work, hopefully in loans and of course in securities as market conditions dictate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
We have probably an ample cash position by design. We were not going to put it into duration risk right now. We
believe it's a waiting game. If there is a significant move in the back end and we can see opportunities, we'll put
some money to work. Right now, we have a lot of zero cost money that we can easily earn and put on in the
market, but we don't think it's the right decision right now. We're going to be patient. And in addition to that, we're
also looking at the opportunity to put these two business models together with Flagstar and look at the holistic
view of the entire portfolio, which would be a reshuffling. So we are not going to exhaust the liquidity today until
we see truly a significant movement of interest rates, and we'll take advantage of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay, and [ph] the spike (00:41:16) yield on new loans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
It's north of 3%, like 3.25%, 3.5% now, that's a good movement. I will tell you fourth quarter is less of a challenge
than it was in Q2 and Q3. So we like the fact that the yield curve has moved very nicely for us like I indicated. I
think the customers are contemplating what they want to do now as they come closer to their role, which is good
for us because it's at a higher rate. So it seems that – and that's also going to impact the decision to go agency
versus portfolio. So any time this curve starts to steepen like this and flows to our advantage, the customers tend
to think about a shorter duration and go to the portfolio lenders.

I'll talk [indiscernible] (00:42:40) and I'll turn the CECL conversation back to Pinto. Big picture, I think you're going
to see in short order a lot of this stuff that's going to roll off the CARES Act. Obviously assuming Congress is done
with providing relief under the CARES Act we believe this $900 some-odd million will come down substantially in
the quarters ahead, probably a substantial adjustment by next time when we report to the marketplace in January,
you should see a noticeable reduction. And I guess by the time March or April comes that that CARES Act will be
exhausted. And we're probably going to be left with some bucket full of loans, but very manageable and highly
reserved given our CECL components when we put that together. And with that, I'll go to John in respect to the
big picture on the reserve side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, right now, as you saw with our CECL results and our small benefit this quarter, we expect to be in that
range, of course, depending upon loan growth as well. So if we do have substantial loan growth, of course, under
CECL you have to provide for that in the quarter. But besides that, we don't see anything in the economic
environment substantially changing. It's been quarter over quarter getting better and improving based on the
Moody's forecasts that come out. So, we're not seeing anything that would give us any pause that we see larger
provisions coming down the road. If anything we're in that small recovery depending on loan growth. We just don't
see anything in the portfolio today that would drive anything else.

Steve Moss Q

John J. Pinto A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.

fourth quarter. We're very comfortable in this $130 million range right now.

Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi, good morning.

Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Matt.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey, just going back to the regulatory approval front. First, I'd assume you need New York State approval. But
who is Flagstar regulated by at the bank level and how does that factor in here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
[ph] Their OCC (00:44:39) and the applications with NYCB, so we would need FDIC and statement. After that
happens, we get the Fed and then we close.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. So it really sounds [indiscernible] (00:44:48)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then just to hone in the deal close down, the timing a little bit. Do you anticipate this being like a first
half of 2022 event? I think someone said first quarter, but I don't remember reading or hearing that from you or in
the release?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Hey, Matt, I was very clear. Obviously, this is in the hands of our regulators. It's going through the application
process and we're anticipating closing as soon as we can in 2022. Other than that, I can't get specific.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Understood.

Thomas Robert Cangemi A

And I apologize for not being able to expand upon that, but it's in the hands of our regulators.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2021
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Completely understand. I was also hoping you could talk a little bit about the partnership with Figure. There's a
couple of data points out there. Mr. Cagney has suggested that you're providing that settlement for them, credit
and sponsorship. You did the private securities transaction this quarter. What are some of the economics for you
in these partnerships and transactions? What are the balance sheet and income statement impacts as this
progresses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
It's a very interesting co-collaboration agreement with Figure. We're invested in the company as we publicly
disclosed. We're very excited about working with the engineers over let's say when combining resources, so we're
both combining our resources. We believe there's a tremendous opportunity as we continue to beta test. So we
did a small transaction with them. That was the beta test and it continues to develop that there's the solution on
the blockchain on clearing through the AML, the KYC process or the banking solutions, at the same time being
very cognizant of the regulatory needs out there to deal with the changing banking world. So, dealing with
someone who's as innovative as Mike and working with us and focused on looking at our balance sheet
opportunities, we think there's tremendous liquidity opportunity on the deposit side, and we believe we'll be seeing
some opportunities and ultimately potential lending opportunities.
And if you think about the big picture, when you put NYCB and Flagstar together, we believe that a lot of the
business opportunities on mortgage banking, mortgage lending will ultimately be on the blockchain. So we think
that the blockchain could really create a lot of efficiencies. It's really probably a more seamless way to do
business when it comes to mortgage lending, and we're exploring with that both on the back end and in the front
end. So these are exciting times. Right now, Matt, it's beta testing, in beta testing and automated testing. And this
is, we're not going to give out any business matches because it's not going to be something we could speak to
until we publicly launch an initiative. So we're still in a beta testing mode. It's been dynamic. I'll call it innovative
and it's exciting. And we're all hands on deck, but clearly with a focus towards trying to find out what solutions. I
mean, you're very familiar what's going on in the banking space. And I think Treasury, I think that all regulatory
world is trying to figure out how do we get this massive amount of liquidity out there to be AML/KYC to the
banking system and we're working with them. I think it's exciting. And again to the private flows and blockchain
solution. So there's a lot happening. Stay tuned and we're excited to be partnering with them.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Great, okay. And then last one for me. In the past you discussed the combined entity, New York Community
Flagstar being able to generate double-digit type loan growth and you touched on warehouse already. But I feel
like we're going to have to see more significant multifamily and commercial real estate growth to get to that kind of
level. I'm just curious what the strategy is there to expand that business, is it more New York City? Is it a
nationwide strategy? [indiscernible] (00:48:17)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Great point. We're excited about it. When the transaction closes, ultimately, we feel highly confident that when we
have people in the field it's going to be a cultural change, right? NYCB does not lend on the field in any
meaningful way. Flagstar has people, they're direct lenders, so we have an indirect business with NYCB. They
have a direct business with Flagstar collectively, we're bringing out to the table substantial opportunities in

markets that are very robust. New York, we don't direct lend. Florida, Ohio, the Midwest, they're doing a great job
on growing. So we think we can have this opportunity here to put people on the field focusing on the positive
growth and combination with C&I with the right people. And we are going to do this with precision as we hire up
collectively as a combined entity to roll out a direct strategy. Direct and indirect will work together, but we think
there's some great growth opportunities. At the same time, we don't really run products to our branches. So we're
taking all of the Flagstar lending products and putting them – we turn them on after legal day one and we have the
opportunity to do business in our branches where our customers will have tremendously more products and that's
the beginning. So as we transition to truly a commercial banking enterprise with a wide array of products, that's
the opportunity that we're all excited about. So we feel highly confident between the fact that they are a mortgage
player and a dominant mortgage player, number six in origination, number six in servicing, number two, top three
in warehouse lending with a much bigger balance sheet, if we could do a lot more there. And these are exciting
businesses because obviously it's consumer-related and we're not a consumer-focused entity on a standalone
basis. So we think we'll have some good growth there, in addition to a very strong C&I presence.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Steven Duong of RBC Capital Markets. Please go
ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Steven.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, good morning, guys. Tom, I guess, maybe if we just get back to Figure, when you go to their white papers, it
looks like they're achieving cost savings on the mortgage side of around 125 basis points from the origination all
the way through the securitization. And when you bring on Flagstar on there, Flagstar is pretty much touching on
literally every part of that process. And I guess have you guys started to size up roughly? Like how much of that
125 basis points you could actually realize, so like I don't know, Flagstar is doing 150 basis points gain on sale. Is
it possible for you to add on another 50 basis points from this partnership with Figure?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, so let me just be clear, and I'm going to turn this back to Lee Smith. I will tell you that they have done a
great job in Flagstar to be relevant in the private label mortgage market, right? So what Mike has done over at
Figure as they've done transactions on the chain is a private label transaction. They're not through the agency,
right, and that's the long term future. But ultimately, as we continue to be significant in the RMBS space, Lee
Smith has indicated fixed deals, that's going to happen in Q1. They're going to do, I think, three or four deals in
Q4, but they're I think top two or three in the country this year on RMBS. These are sizable transactions. If done

through the chain, I think there will be reduced costs materially. So I think there's opportunity there as you grow
the business. And I wouldn't underestimate that opportunity. But in the meantime, the frontend and the backend,
that's a long term solution when it comes to an agency player. But the non-agency opportunity where large, we'll it
portfolio management, buy these types of assets, they're very comfortable transacting on the chain. So maybe
Lee, if you want to maybe give some color as well to the opportunity, obviously without putting numbers, but just
some big picture theory there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Matthew Smith A
Executive Vice President & President-Mortgages, Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. No, absolutely, and good question, Steven. Look, you can't put any numbers to it, because it's a new
relationship for NYCB. We haven't closed that deal. As soon as we do we can start working on this more and
trying to figure out and quantify the opportunity, as you know, with the blockchain. Blockchain is an ecosystem,
particularly if you're talking end to end mortgage and so the big numbers that you just quoted, you're going to
need a number of players within that ecosystem to start to realize some of those benefits. As Tom just alluded to,
as it relates specifically to RMBS and where the second biggest player in RMBS, if you look at Q3, there's some
very discrete advantages. So if you think that the blockchain is a trustless ledger, you don't have to due diligence
every single loan in an RMBS transaction if you're comfortable with the way the blockchain is working. So there's
obviously immediate savings from a due diligence point of view. Transfer and payment is instantaneous. And so I
think from an RMBS point of view that would be the more immediate opportunity. But as Tom said, it's very much
in the early stages and the exploratory stages. But it's an opportunity and that's how we're looking at it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks, I appreciate that, Lee, and I guess just maybe just from your experience, do you see this blockchain
eventually leading to kind of like an overall industry shift on the cost front? And do you guys see this as an
opportunity being a first mover?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Matthew Smith A
Executive Vice President & President-Mortgages, Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.
Possibly. I mean, look, I think there's a lot of technology solutions out there and all mortgage companies are
looking at ways to get more efficient, do things quicker and improve the customer experience. And if the
blockchain enables that then that's a good thing. There's a number of fintechs and technologies out there that
we're constantly looking at. This is one of them. And I know that Tom and his team are doing the same on the
New York Community banking side. So I think it is an opportunity. And we're plugged in and one of the
frontrunners should it prove to be something that we and ultimately the industry can take advantage of.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
I appreciate that. Thank you. And then just one last one for me, just on the CDs running off. I guess, just like the
current rates right now on your CDs, like how low do you think they can get to? And are the CDs basically moving
over into, say, savings accounts?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I think that's probably the case. I mean, obviously, we're at a point now where we've enjoyed multiple years
of expanding margins, right, since the shift of policy by the Fed reserve and where rates are close to zero. So I
think we're at a point now where the next $10.3 billion coming due is still in the mid-40 basis point. So some are

going to savings, some – but I think let's just call it flat and that's – I think that's the strategy here, but ultimately
the shift of culture into non-interest bearing, the shift in culture to go after commercial customer accounts [ph]
which I (00:55:40) believe is our right as the lender and that's a cultural strategy shift that when forcing at the
board level all the way down to the rank and file, the team memberships, and it's working. So I think that culture of
the historical view of NYCB thrift model is moving more towards the traditional commercial model that should
drive the margin as well, which I think will be significantly driven by the combination with Flagstar. That's what
they do. At the same time, when you think about fixed rate lending versus floating rate, it's a very unique blended
opportunity to bring these businesses together culturally and ultimately as we go out in the field and have direct
lenders that go after those C&I opportunities, it's deposit first, lending second. I think that's the cultural shift that
we're going through right now, and we're super excited to do it with Sandro DiNello's team, because he's done a
phenomenal job on growing it. So we're doing it together. Once we combine that, we're excited about that
opportunity.

Christopher Marinac Q

Thanks. Hey, Tom. Good, how are you? Could you or Lee or Sandro talk about the non-qualified market, how
much more opportunity exists here and is that another source of revenue as the merger closes?

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Salvatore J. DiMartino A
Managing Director & Director-Investor Relations & Strategic Planning, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, I don't know the answer to that, but I will tell you this and our history supports what I'm going to say. If there
is an opportunity there, we will certainly jump on it. And as Lee mentioned in his comments, the key I think to our
mortgage business is that we've got a lot of different delivery channels and levers we can pull to take advantage
of whatever the opportunity is out there. So I don't know the answer. I'm not going to speculate on how much of
an opportunity there might be, because I don't know what the market conditions are going to be. But I know with
full confidence that if there is an opportunity there, we will seize it.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2021
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, so I would just add to that point, and Sandro and Lee, I'm sure you want to chime in, but assuming there is
a real change in the slope of the curve and rates start to gravitate higher, we will balance sheet residential
lending. We will balance sheet prime type loans on the portfolio. We will have other products to utilize the balance
sheet which will also, and going back to my other point which I missed, [ph] whether (00:58:04) that's another
contribution to potential growth of our assets by just being able to balance sheet high quality loans with portfolio
as well. And that tends to be the case when rates are in a different perspective and customers focus more on
adjustable rate feature. We're very comfortable putting on [indiscernible] (00:58:21) loans on the portfolio. We've
done it before very successfully and with Flagstar's distribution, we could do it in a much more material way. So,
maybe Lee, if you want to add more color to that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Matthew Smith A
Executive Vice President & President-Mortgages, Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, no. I think you covered most of that. I was going to say, if there is an opportunity we can take advantage of
it, we have the balance sheet, we have the RMBS program. So we have different ways that we can execute on
these loans and different methods of either holding them or dispersing them. And then as Tom mentioned we
have the sales force across multiple channels, whether it's TPOs, distributed retail, direct lending. And so if it is
something that is an opportunity we can ramp up pretty quickly given the number of sales channels and sales
teams that we have.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alessandro P. DiNello A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Flagstar Bancorp, Inc.
And just to put a finer point on that comment, we have very strong origination teams and channels in the higher
cost areas of the country where that product is more likely to exist. So principally part of what has grown through
the Opus Advisors acquisition we did a few years ago, we – and as you can see from the securitizations we've
done, our access to those markets is very, very, very strong. So to the extent, again, as I say, that the opportunity
is there, we'll take advantage of it. Historically, we have at times put those loans on our books as well. But the
private securitization opportunity in recent quarters has just been so interesting that we've gone that route. But at
times the market might not be as strong, in which case there'd be more consideration. I'm talking about Flagstar
independent here where we would portfolio it. You get into post-merger, it's a different dynamic because the
balance sheet's going to be much, much bigger and much different than it looks like with just Flagstar today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Great. Thank you all for that background. It's really, really helpful. And Tom, just a final question. When you look
at the sort of stock repurchase opportunities post-regulatory approval in closing, is it still as good as you thought
back in April when the merger was announced?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
Director, President & Chief Executive Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Oh, look, obviously, we are very pleased with Flagstar's results. They've actually outperformed our internal
forecasts when we sat down and talked about putting a couple together and perform at the company.
So on a common equity perspective, then there's probably going to be more given the earnings profile, which is
very attractive for additional tangible value creation on the transaction. The companies are going to earn on a
combined basis a lot of money and we're going to have a substantial reduction in our overall dividend payout ratio

because of that. So we'll have more flexibility on capital management tools. As I indicated in the previous
quarters, we're not going to be talking about repurchases in the midst of the transaction, but once the company
has put its capital together and its earnings power, we invest in people, systems, the business itself and at the
same time, paying a very strong dividend. We will also consider the capital opportunities on the buybacks. And
clearly, if the market is attractive for that, we will consider all options. But clearly this company is a different profile
when it comes to capital generation when we enjoy the benefit of [indiscernible] (01:01:54) capital. They have
significant capital on a standalone basis. We have to pay a very large dividend. Collectively, the blended payout
ratio goes down materially and ultimately, as I said, their performance has been much better than we expected in
2021 that we remodeled and as we know from the original presentation of the deal, we modeled a, I think it was
about a 50% reduction in the mortgage business going into 2022, and obviously that's pretty severe. So, and it
still generates significant earnings accretion with significant capital generation. So we're very pleased about
where they are today and we're looking forward to enjoying that opportunity in the future.
