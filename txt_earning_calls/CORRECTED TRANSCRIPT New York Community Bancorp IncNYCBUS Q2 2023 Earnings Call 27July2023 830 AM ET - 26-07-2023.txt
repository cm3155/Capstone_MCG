Q2 2023 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2023
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the NYCB Second Quarter 2023 Earnings
Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in the listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a
question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded on Thursday, July 27th, 2023.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Sal DiMartino. Please go ahead.

Salvatore J. DiMartino
Executive Vice President, Chief of Staff to the CEO & Director-Investor Relations, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, operator and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the Management team of New York
Community Bancorp for today's conference call. Our discussion today of the company's second quarter 2023
results will be led by President and Chief Executive Officer, Thomas Cangemi, who is joined by the company's
Chief Financial Officer, John Pinto, along with Reggie Davis, President of Banking; Eric Howell, President of
Commercial and Private Banking; and Lee Smith, President of Mortgage.
Before the discussion begins, I'd like to remind you that certain comments made today by the Management team
of New York Community may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements we may make are subject to these Safe Harbor
rules. Please review the forward-looking disclaimer and Safe Harbor language in today's press release and
presentation for more information about risks and uncertainties which may affect us.
With that out of the way, I would now like to turn it over to Mr. Cangemi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Sal. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I would like to begin by briefly
summarizing the strong operating results we achieved during the second quarter. Early this morning, we reported
record net income, earnings per share, fueled in large part by the benefits from our two recent acquisitions of
Flagstar Bank and Signature. This is our first quarter with all three legacy franchises combined under one
umbrella. Not only are we benefiting financially from our combinations, we are continuing to benefit from the
power of diversification in both our loan portfolio and our deposit composition. I believe that our operating
performance is only just beginning to show the true underlying core earnings power of our combined organization.
From an earnings and net income perspective, diluted earnings per share as adjusted for $141 million bargain
purchase gain, and other merger related items, we reported a record $0.47 per share. Our net income available to
common stockholders totaled a record of $345 million, more than double what we reported during the first quarter.
Operating results were driven by a full quarter benefit from the Signature transaction, as opposed to only 12
business days, last quarter, and a significantly higher net interest margin. Our NIM expanded by 61 basis points
to 3.21% on a linked-quarter basis driven by higher interest-earning assets, specifically cash and stronger yields
on our loan portfolio as our asset sensitivity balance sheet continues to benefit from the higher interest rate
environment. Our net interest margin should remain elevated over the course of the year, given our diversified
loan portfolio, which is mostly variable rate and our increasing core deposits funding liability banks.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2023
Our funding composition continues to improve as core deposits increased, while CDs, both retail and brokered,
declined. Also, wholesale borrowings declined 24% as we used a portion of our cash balances to pay down $5
billion of Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Over time, I believe this change in our funding mix will be an
advantage and support higher multiple expansion in the go-forward periods. In addition, another positive was our
capital. Our capital ratios trended higher, while tangible book value per share increased 4% compared to the prior
quarter and 23% year-over-year. Our tangible capital generation remains very strong given our earnings power.
Aside from our strong quarterly results, last week we announced the expansion of our private banking
businesses, which we added as part of the Signature Bank transaction, by hiring 16 from the former First Republic
Bank. These initiatives are highly regarded, and the fact that they chose to join the new Flagstar is a testament to
our business model and strong reputation in the marketplace. With these hires, we have a total of 127 teams, as
of June 30, 2023, including 92 in the Northeast and 35 on the West Coast. And we now operate in 10 cities.
These teams are part of a broader strategy to create a premier private banking division dedicated, delivering best-
in-class service to a personalized single point of contact model. We're excited that these 16 can partner with us
and look forward to achieving great things together.
Moving on to our balance sheet. Total loans were up modestly during the second quarter, reflecting our
diversification efforts, as growth in the C&I portfolio offset declines in other lending verticals. Overall, total loans
and leases were $83.3 billion, up about $800 million or 1% compared to the previous quarter, primarily driven by
growth in the C&I book, which benefited by continued growth in the mortgage warehouse business. At June 30,
total commercial loans represented 44% of total loans and leases. As for asset quality, the metrics remained
strong and despite – and also best in the industry, despite an uptick in NPLs off of historical low levels in legacy
NYCB. NPAs totaled $246 million or 21 basis points compared to $174 million or 14 basis points last quarter. The
increase resulted largely from the inclusion of acquired loans from both of our acquisitions. Despite this uptick,
NPAs and total assets ranked in the top quartile compared to industry peers reflecting our disciplined underwriting
and client selection. Furthermore, the allowance for credit losses increased $44 million to $594 million compared
to the previous quarter. And coverage was 255% of non-performing loans and 71 basis points of total loans.
Importantly, this was another quarter of low or no loan losses as we recorded a net recovery of $1 million
compared to zero net charge-offs last quarter.
Another positive was our deposit base. Total deposits increased $3.7 billion or 17% annualized on a linked-
quarter basis to $88.5 billion, as the increase in non-interest bearing deposits more than offset the decline in other
categories, including higher cost CDs and deposits related to the loan portfolios we did not acquire from
Signature. Including in non-interest bearing deposits are approximately $5.9 billion of custodial deposits related to
Signature transaction. Excluding these deposits, non-interest bearing deposits now represent 29% of total
deposits, compared to 27%, last quarter.
Coming off the March events, our deposit base remains increasingly resilient. This is due in large part to the
diversity of the distribution channels, which in addition to our retail branch network, includes commercial and
private client groups, digital and banking-as-a-service and deposits derived through the mortgage ecosystem.
Deposits at Legacy Signature declined $1.4 billion on a linked-quarter basis, excluding custodial accounts. This
was primarily due to a planned runoff in higher cost CDs and broker deposits, offset by $285 million quarter-over-
quarter growth in non-interest bearing demand deposits. In addition to the stabilization in the deposit base,
Legacy Signature PCG teams have also stabilized and we expect to grow from these levels.
As for guidance, given the current economic and interest rate environment, we currently expect the NIM in the
range of 2.95% to 3.05%, mortgage gain on sale between $20 million to $24 million, net return on MSR assets

between 8% to 10%, loan admin income of approximately $15 million, and annual expenses ranging between $2
billion to $2.1 billion, excluding merger-related expenses and intangible amortization, as well as a 23% full year
tax rate.
In terms of expenses, total OpEx were $515 million, up $123 million or 31% on a linked-quarter basis. Second
quarter operating expenses include a full quarter of Signature expenses compared to only 12 days during the first
quarter.
Finally, I'd like to say a special thank you, to all of our teammates, which now number nearly 10,000 strong. Our
results would not be possible without the dedication and commitment to our clients and our customers.
With that, we will be happy to answer any questions you may have. We'll do our very best to get to all of you
within the time remaining. But if we don't, please feel free to call us later today or this week.
Operator, please open the line for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with the question-and-answer session.
[Operator Instructions] Please wait for a moment while we compile the Q&A roster.
The first question comes from Brody Preston with UBS. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Brody.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I was hoping that you would talk a little bit about the duration of those custodial non-interest bearing deposits.
You've kind of carved in out separately. And it seems like they're related to the servicing maybe of the FDIC – the
loans you're servicing for the FDIC. How long would those stick around? And, I guess, in conjunction with that,
how long would the loan administration income from the subservicing – or the loan administration income from the
subservicing of those loans stick around as well at that $15 million level.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Sure. So, Brody, I'll give it – I'll pass it over to John Pinto. But it's in our guidance, so John why don't you just
speak specifically to this issue?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. So, we'll start quickly, because it's in the guidance, with the loan admin income. So, this is the cost recovery
of servicing the loans that we did not take as part of the Signature transaction. So, if we look back at what those
words, the CRE book and it's the fund banking loans, the fund banking loans have paid off pretty significantly in

the quarter. So that's why we've seen a larger number in this, in that loan servicing income number in the loan
admin income number, for this quarter than what we're guiding in Q3. We expect those loans to continue to pay
down. And it's really those paydowns that we saw throughout the second quarter that built up the custodial
deposits that we had throughout the quarter. So, both issues are intertwined in that the receivership loans, as
they're paying down, we're collecting those funds for the FDIC and then on a monthly basis, we are remitting that
back to them.
So, we will see lower FDIC or custodial deposits related to Signature as the loan portfolios shrink. And over time,
depending on the disposition of those quarters, which we expect to be for fund, we expect the sale probably to be
in the early fourth quarter, we will start to see those numbers drop as we go forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Thank you for that. Excluding the $5.9 billion, you still had some solid non-interest bearing deposit growth. I
think [ph] you called $285 million (11:29) but that was related to Signature. And so, Tom, maybe you could give us
an update in terms of how the work is progressing to kind of bring back those Signature non-interest bearing
deposits that left before the acquisition.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well the good news is that the teams are stable like we discussed in the opening remarks. But more importantly,
we're building the team so we think about where we're heading with the business. On the private client group, we
anticipate to have more PCG teams going forward than Signature had, pretty much, which is really the
momentum of the business model. When it comes to DDA, it was stable throughout the entire quarter. And as we
indicated, we were up slightly, which is a very positive signal based on what we anticipated when we announced
the transaction. So, clearly better than expected. I think what's exciting about it is that the opportunity to take the
business model and look at the other opportunities that we have as a combined company and look at the overall
corporate finance opportunity we have within these middle markets groups. So that's another exciting attribute.
And the teams are excited to be building back the liabilities that have shredded off the balance sheet because of
the fear in March. And not only are we seeing positive momentum there, the teams are excited, it's stable and we
believe that over time as things start to stabilize, we'll get more deposits back.
And we have Eric here on the line. So, Eric, if you want to share some commentary, about what we're seeing with
the teams.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric Howell A
Senior Executive Vice President and President of Commercial and Private Banking, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes, thanks, Tom. Look, the teams are really starting to have success and attract those clients back. Our clients
simply just don't want to be at the mega institutions that they ran to. They can't provide the level of service that we
can provide. So, we are seeing strong demand deposit growth because the teams really provide stellar service.
We're also seeing strong off-balance sheet money market fund growth because our clients appreciate our service
and want us to be able to control the entire client experience. So, we're seeing clients come back. We're seeing
new client growth. And we're obviously seeing the ability to attract new banking teams. So, it's going to be very
powerful as we look forward.

Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
And that's also pre First Republic as we focus on the opportunity that dislocated the marketplace, we believe is
great, great opportunity as we got into bringing on new PCG teams that focus on service, and obviously that have
the entrepreneurial view of what Signature built, over the years, when it comes to deposit gathering efforts. So,
excited about that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And John, do you happen to have the purchase accounting accretion number for the quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. So, that was another item that came in better than expected, and one of the reasons why our margin was as
strong as it was. If you look at it from both institutions, Flagstar really came in where we anticipated it in that $25
million range. It was the Signature purchase accounting that came in faster. We had more significant paydown in
the loan portfolio than we anticipated. The portfolio dropped by a little under $1 billion, due to a couple of different
movements between loan categories and our negotiations about which loans that we took that we talked about on
the last call. So, when you look at the actual accretion, it was $75 million, for Signature, in the quarter, and about
$20 million of that was related to unanticipated paydowns.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And then last one for...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Going forward...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yes, go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes, sorry, Brody. Just going forward, I would expect that to be more in that $50 million, $55 million range. But it
is, of course, as you know, dependent on which loans pay down and what kind of marks we had against those
loans.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And then the last one from me, Tom, I think you addressed the uptick in NPLs. I thought I heard you say
there is from the inclusion of acquired loans or something. I was just hoping you could address the CRE, the
increase in the CRE NPLs and if any of that was tied to office. Just because I noticed that you said that you did
have, you've got a decent amount of office reappraisals done at this point as well.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2023
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. So specifically to NPAs, we had an uptick on Signature loans that we acquired. So you would assume that's
in the purchase – that's probably well embedded in purchase accountings. We're comfortable that. We're covered
there when it comes to any potential loss there. But that's $31 million of Signature exposure that we acquired as
part of the transaction. The other piece mostly is from loans acquired through Flagstar. The [ph] other $22 million
in total from the loans acquired from Flagstar, so overall it was flat when you take out the acquisitions all together
(16:01).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. Thank you very much, everyone. I appreciate it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. And next question comes from Steve Moss with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning. Sorry if I missed it here, but I wanted to ask about the First Republic team. Just some teams you
hired. Just curious as to what kind of book of business or how big a book of business is. And any color you can
give there, Tom.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Please let me start off by saying we're super-excited to have them and we're super-excited to build it, and build a
PCG model, and continue to invest in that model. So, we are making investments. Clearly, Signature's growth
organically was is the model, right. So, it's very similar entrepreneurial in how they look at the business as a high
wide – high touch service, focusing on boots on the ground and making their clients very comfortable on a
banking perspective. So that's, so the focus here is that there's a dislocation in the marketplace. It's very
competitive.
I'm going to pass it on to Eric. But before that, I just want to tell you that we're super-excited to have them. Stay
tuned. It's a lot of activity out there. And hopefully, we continue to be successful on convincing these team
members to become part of the new Flagstar.
So, Eric, do you want to give some more color there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric Howell A
Senior Executive Vice President and President of Commercial and Private Banking, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. I mean, each one of these teams comes with a book of billions of dollars of deposits and loans as well as,
wealth assets and the AUM. So, very excited to have all of them. There are three in New York, three in California,
thus far, as Tom alluded to. And we just feel that we're the best without question, the best cultural fit, for these
bankers, right? We have an entrepreneurial model, like they had, that truly caters to the clients' needs, with that

single point of touch contact. So, this is a great home for them. It's great cultural fit. We have the products and
services that we need to go to market, which is critical. And we're really looking forward to their future success
here. But billions in deposits and loans per team.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Appreciate that color. And Eric, you mentioned that deposit momentum remains strong. Sounds like it's into
July. Is there any color you could give around the trends you've seen, after June 30th, just to kind of get a feel for
what's coming on?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I'll start off by saying we're seeing overall for the banks in total is very stable. I will tell you that we still have to
deal with some of the assets are going to be sold in the market that are attached to the core franchise of [ph]
Signature, in particular Ventures so we anticipate to see that run off eventually, and that sale was done (18:47) as
soon as deposits will follow. The outside of the anticipated businesses that were not acquired to the transaction,
we see strong stability, and in addition to Signature transaction, the Community Bank franchise has been very
stable.
Maybe Reggie can share some commentary on what we're seeing on the Community Bank. But we're a
diversified company. So maybe, Reggie, you can add some color to what we're seeing on the retail side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Reginald E. Davis A
Senior Executive VP & President-Banking, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Sure, Tom. So, yes, Tom said, through the balance of the year, we had lost about 3% deposits through the
liquidity challenge that the banking industry faced. But we're starting to see those deposits come back. They
definitely stabilized. And we're actually starting to see some modest opportunity for growth. We're projecting
actually the deposits stay relatively flat through the balance of the year, and that our weighted average cost is de
minimis in terms of the inquiry. So, we feel really good about the stability of that portfolio. I think it reflects the
strong relationship that our bankers have with our clients. And then, on the commercial side, equally, we're seeing
[ph] some opportunity, actually some deposits, because (19:55) we look at opportunities to strategically bring on
clients, who are maybe disenfranchised, from other lending organizations that cannot land in the current
environment. And so, we're actually picking up some relationships on that side as well. So very positive
momentum on the deposit side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
That's great [ph] color I like to addition (20:15). Culturally, the focus here is relationship deposit gathering, in all of
our lines of businesses. That's the culture here going forward. I said it many quarters deposits, deposits, deposits,
culture, culture, culture. And on the culture build, they're really meshing well. We're putting three companies
together to build a new Flagstar. And clearly, I think, on the lending side, our lending teams truly understand that
we're leading with the deposit opportunity. We really want to make sure that we fund the balance sheet,
commercial bank like, in our transition from dependency on wholesale finance will dissipate over time. But we've
made significant strides in that way over the past few years. Notable if you look at the percentage of wholesale to
total deposits. So, we're excited about that. But that is the culture that's all building here.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2023
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Great. Appreciate all the color there. And one last one for me just on expenses here, as you look to integrate all
three banks, kind of curious as to, where do you think, if you have any update as to where the expense run rate
could shake out, post the integrations in some point in 2024?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I mean, we gave public guidance, it was about $2 billion to $2.1 billion. Is that right, John? That was the public
guidance we gave. That's fully loaded with anticipation of being $100 billion-plus bank, the First Republic teams
that we anticipate bringing on. So we think we have some reasonable conservatism around that, given the nature
of the growth story. This is going to be a very powerful opportunity for us to capitalize in the marketplace with this
location. And we feel that as we go into 2024, you'll start seeing a lot of integration benefits of putting the systems
together, so that the significant adjustment that we'll see next year will be through consolidations of systems. And
we're looking forward to that.
John, if you want to add some color.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. So when you look at that $2 billion to $2.1 billion, that's our 2023 guide. As Tom mentioned, with the
conversions that we have coming in 2024, we're comfortable that our non-interest expense base is not going to
grow dramatically off of that guide from 2023 to 2024. So, that's where we're comfortable, very consistent with
what we said in our last call, where we mentioned where, we might see some of the upcoming quarters be a little
bit higher, but we think it will stabilize over time and we think it'll stabilize in this range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
And that has the anticipated cost structure of the new teams. Maybe Eric can talk a little bit about economics, how
we view the business and how we can build that to neutrality and ultimately to a total return basis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric Howell A
Senior Executive Vice President and President of Commercial and Private Banking, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
And ultimately, we see, the deposits and loan growth that will be coming in, getting us to a breakeven in about a
year, and a total earn back in 18 months on that, which is pretty normal for team growth. When you acquire these
teams, they come with nothing, right? There's no loans. There's no deposits. It's not like acquiring a bank. So, it
does take a little bit longer for them to ramp up and get to a breakeven point, because you just don't have those
revenue streams out the gate. But what happens over multiple years is that they continue to grow, right? And they
don't stop growing because of the way that we align their interest with those of the overall bank. So, when you
look down the road after three years, they're well into 20%-plus ROE and that'll continue to ratchet up over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
As we pay down expenses, finance, that's the goal.

Good morning.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey good morning. Question on just on the NIM benefit from those $5.9 billion of custodial deposits from
Signature this quarter. Should we just think of that as [ph] those $6 billion of deposits add the 5% rate (24:05) you
get with the Fed, is that the benefit to NIM this quarter from that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes, that's the benefit. We did keep that money at the Fed. The number, you know, that was the number at June
30th. The average number was a little higher when you look back at especially April and May. But yes, it's at
about 5%. And I'd say the average is probably closer to $8 billion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. So, as these deposits come down, and I think you're saying they should only really start coming down, in
the fourth quarter, right? So over the next quarter or so...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
No.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

...should you still get some benefit?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
No. The large piece, and that's why you see the guide on the margin being lower than [ph] the 3.21% actual in Q3
(24:57), right? So, the large amount of the pay of the custodial deposits we believe happened in the second
quarter. We think that the pay-offs in the portfolios have slowed a little bit. So, we're collecting a lot less, right
now. Plus the announcement that the fund banking business is expected to hit market, and potentially be sold in

October. We're going to see a drop in the third quarter just because of the way that the cash flows in that portfolio
occurred in Q2 compared to our expecting them to occur in Q3. So we're going to see that [ph] $6 billion (25:34)
go out very quickly in July.

Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
And it's in our margin guide.

Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. All right. Perfect. And then separately, just on regulation, we're expecting the Basel III endgame rules
today. Now that you're over $100 billion in assets, can you talk about how you're planning for any increase in
capital requirements, and how you think about the right level of capital that you'd like to maintain?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So I'll start off and I'll defer to John. But obviously, this is, until the rules come out, we'll have better clarity. So,
we'll have it when you have it, and hopefully very soon, sometime today. At end of the day, we spent a lot of time
thinking through it. And obviously, we believe there'll be some type of implementation period.
But this company is building capital. This company, for the first time in a long time, is generating tangible book
value creation by the earnings power of the company. So, we feel very confident that we have adequate capital.
And when the rules come out, we'll be able to assess how it impacts our position at $100 billion. Just bear in
mind, over the past decade, actually going back to 2012, we've been preparing to be a C-corp Bank. And since
we've right before the Flagstar transaction, we were preparing to be $100 billion bank, right under the new rules.
So clearly, this is going to have some impact. And then, we've seen the actual literature on it. We'll assess it and
run the analysis to see how it will impact us. But clearly, we're prepared for it.
And John, if you want to add some color there as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. For some of the items that we're expecting is going to be in the proposed rules, including the lack of an AOCI
opt-out. We actually screen really well when you look at us comparative to our peers in the $100 billion-plus
range, where you look at CET1, when you include the loss on securities, and we jump to the top quartile of capital
ratios, against a lot of our peers. So, there's a lot of, no doubt, a lot of work to do, once the proposed rules really
come out and we'll analyze it. And as Tom mentioned, we'll deal with the implementation period, and go forward

from there. No doubt there'll be higher needs for capital, but we are generating it on an organic basis, right now,
which is really nice to see.

Hey, guys. Good morning. Just on loan growth, so it was modest, but you noted it reflected some of the
presentation efforts and a disciplined client selection underwriting. You did have some growth in mortgage
warehouse. So just wondering, where are you seeing across your verticals with regard to demand and what is
your outlook for loan growth in the back half of the year?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2023
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, it's interesting. We've had obviously a disrupted market since the Fed was very proactive in raising interest
rates, at least on the multi-family CRE side. So if you think about what's going on with that portfolio, it's relatively
flat and our coupons are rising significantly as customers are opting to go into a SOFR option as they get ready
for what they anticipate, hopefully lower rates in their perspective in 2024 and 2025. So we've had about $3.4
billion that we didn't have in a year ago or a year and a half ago, that opted to take the SOFR option, which puts
us in a very good position. Right now, that's slightly south of 8%, coming off a 3% coupon, and they're paying the
bills, which is phenomenal. And these are wealthy customers and they're making business decisions not to lock in
a fixed rate structure.
In the other side of that, we also opted to put into synthetically some structure that allows them to lock in, we'll call
it, a quite a swap transaction tied to a fixed rate option that they could live with, given if they feel that this is the
right fixed rate time to lock in the next five to 10 years. That's also been a new strategy for the bank. But on the
multifamily [ph] side, having a CRE is not a (29:43) lot of activity. So we think that will turn in 2024 or 2025 as
rates may go lower for them. It will have a lot of opportunity. At the same time, we're gearing up for the Signature
portfolio that's interrelated as customers. So, we're going to look at those opportunities and bank the relationship
that we have. We have a lot of cross relationships, so we think there will be some good growth there as we go
into 2024 and 2025. So I think that business, which is the largest component of our balance sheet when it comes
to asset classes, is operating as expected given the environment.
In respect to the other lines of businesses, it's been a reasonable growth story. We're allocating capital based on
hurdle rate of returns. It's more of a philosophical view as we look at the businesses. And more importantly, we're
hurdling at expected it returns, because credit trends are much tighter right now. So we're able to offer a much
higher rate given the marketplace. So, it's a tighter credit market in all our businesses. So, we're seeing strong
opportunity in builder finance. You mentioned warehouse. Warehouse is doing extremely well. Because of
dislocation, many banks that were in the warehouse business can't be in the warehouse business, given what
happened in March. And we're seeing the overflow into our book, and we welcome that opportunity. And it's all
finance.
So maybe, Lee, if you want to talk a little bit about MSR and Warehouse as well as on the mortgage side. We're
seeing some positive trends there.
But I would say in theory, right now, as expected, based on our growth trajectory, we're as according to plan, I
think, I said it last quarter, we don't have to make a loan this year, and we'll do very well. The good news is that
our businesses are thriving, and we're looking forward to allocate capital to this opportunity, at much higher
spreads.
So Lee, if you want to talk a little bit about warehouse MSR, and you may want to talk a little bit about the
mortgage business as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Matthew Smith A
Senior Executive VP & President-Mortgage, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes, sure. Thanks, Tom. So let me start with Warehouse. And you'll see from the numbers, average balances
were up $600 million quarter-over-quarter. Now, part of that was due to mortgage volumes being up about 35%
quarter-over-quarter, when you look at what was happening in the industry, and we got the natural lift from that.
But as Tom mentioned, there's been dislocation in the warehouse space, and we've seen a number of players

announce that they're exiting. And we can take advantage of that. We've already seen, towards the end of the
quarter, some of the clients that were party to those banks that are exiting reach out to us. And as you know,
we're already the second largest warehouse lender in the business. And so, as we move into the second half of
this year, we think we can take more market share as a result of the dislocation and some of these other players
exiting.
Now, as Tom says, when we make loans, whether it's warehouse or MSR, we're always looking at the return on
equity. And the great thing about warehouse is it turns very quickly. And so, we're generating very strong returns
and we feel confident that we can continue to show market share growth, as we move through the second half of
the year. Just given the dislocation we're seeing. That's also spreading into the mortgage servicing lending arena
as well. And we've seen players pull back as they're looking to sort of preserve capital. We've got a very strong
capital position. And so, we've seen good growth from an MSR servicing advance lending point of view. And we
think we'll continue to see that as we move through the second half of this year as well.
And then, just coming back to mortgage originations, generally, and as Tom mentioned, there's been dislocation
in that space. We've seen a major player exiting the market. We've seen minor players exiting the market. And
our fallout-adjusted locks quarter-over-quarter increased 70%. That's what we calculate gain on sale on. The vast
majority of that increase were in the TPO channels, particularly, the correspondent channels, given some of the
dislocation that I just mentioned and we feel that we'll continue to take advantage of that as we move through the
second half of the year as well. So, a lot of this dislocation is really playing into our hands. And we feel good
about our positioning. We've been in the mortgage business 35 years. We've been in the warehouse business, 30
years, and we're performing very well, right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. So, in addition to that, I think the reality is that we are in these businesses and they're thriving. But more
importantly, the focus towards the complete banking relationship, we're seeing good deposit flows. We want to do
better. We wanted higher compensating balances. But that's the mandate. And given that this dislocation is
moving assets of other balance sheets, we are seeing higher deposit compensating balances in these lines of
business, which is very encouraging for our culture going forward as being a relationship deposit-driven
institution.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
No, I appreciate. That's a great color. If I have one follow-up, I think this question is for Eric. So, Legacy Signature
had a specialized banking team that focused on EB-5 deposits. I'm just curious, was that team acquired? If so,
wondering if you could comment on any pipeline growth that could be there. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric Howell A
Senior Executive Vice President and President of Commercial and Private Banking, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes, we actually exited that team, while maintaining the book and moving it to another team that did have
experience in that field. And we do anticipate that we will see growth in that area. EB-5 now is a bit more stable
now that the government has approved the EB-5 program for five years. They used to do it on an annual basis,
and often they didn't approve it timely, given congressional matters. So, the program is now in place for an
extended period of time, and we are adding more capabilities there. And we're actually bringing on board a client,
a banker from another institution to rejoin us. And we expect to see some pretty significant growth in that space
as the deposits build.

Just going back to the conversation, on the teams, it seems like you guys have a great opportunity, going forward,
here to capture even more of the First Republic teams, as well as successful teams, from other banks, given the
incentive structures, you guys, now have in place. Was wondering how the new team pipeline looks, at this point,
after capturing those teams. Was curious if that got people's attention. I would think that it would have and might
even bring even more interest. And then, just going back to what Eric mentioned, on what these teams are
bringing over, it was great hearing about the billions of deposits and loans. But you also mentioned AUM, which
was a very exciting part of the First Republic business. Do you guys need to develop or build out any functionality
to support those wealth assets or just the wealth business in general? And then, is that going to be a big focus
here in terms of bringing on more teams with wealth management assets, and growing that business, going
forward?

I'm going to be very short and sweet in this one, and would defer to Eric, but just stay tuned because things are
fluid. But Eric, why don't you handle that question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric Howell A
Senior Executive Vice President and President of Commercial and Private Banking, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Sure. Thanks, Dave. Thanks, Tom. And good to talk to you, Dave. Yes, I mean, the opportunity is real, right?
When you look at the banking landscape, the mega banks, who we specifically built the institution to compete
against, and they're more arrogant than ever, which is great. Bankers, at the regional banks, quite frankly, don't
have ammunition, to go to market with, right? So, we not only have a balance sheet, to utilize, but we have an
approach and a team-based compensation model, and practices that are attractive to these bankers out there.
So, I think it is sending a buzz around the industry. We are actively engaged with a number of other teams, to look
to bring on board, and we will certainly be adding to our wealth capabilities. We did add some people already that
we'll be announcing, but we broadly have the capabilities on the wealth side to meet the needs of these – of the
teams and the clients that they're onboarding.
We always are looking to improve. But I'd say, Dave, that we have the vast majority of the needs that we can
meet their needs of their clients, right now. So, we feel good about the capabilities that we have. And now it's just
attracting the wealth management side of the business to work with those banking teams.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Great. That sounds good. Maybe just a smaller one on the margin and borrowings rolling off, it sounded like
you've got another roughly $5 billion or so in the back half of this year. I was just curious what that opportunity
looks like for next year, as you try to, offload the rest of this wholesale funding.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. So, next year, [ph] $2.9 billion at a 2.27% (39:22) is what we have coming, so that portfolio has really, really
gotten low compared to where we've been in the past, especially for the size bank we are right now. But yes, $4.9
billion, this year, assuming some of the portables get put, which we are assuming that they will, given their current
cost and next year, [ph] $2.9 billion at a 2.27% (39:45).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So Dave just to be specific, when we announced the Signature transaction, our plan was to pay down the
wholesale, and be more obviously deposit-focused. This is in our strategy. So, as John indicated, a lot of the
higher cost stuff has paid off already, and we've replaced it with demand, money and liquidity, from the
transaction. But, I think, holistically going forward, we want to be obviously having a much more focused loan-to-
deposit ratio, indicative of a commercial bank model. But obviously, as we said time and time again, the culture
here is relationship banking, the length of the deposits, lever the deposit opportunities, and we think we have a lot
of low-lying fruit as we put this organization together.
One of the areas that we didn't talk a whole lot about, but we have a very diversified team of people that can really
serve as the Signature transaction, when it comes to opportunity on the corporate banking side. And I think that's
going to be something in the years to come that's going to be very favorable, as we look at leading deals for these

middle-market clients. These are very strong companies. And we have tremendous deposit relationships. But they
don't have a lot, we'll call it, loan activity, specifically, for some of these larger corporate clients, as we are not
leading the corporate side of the balance sheet. So, we can be active there as well, syndicating deals, structuring
deals, and being a corporate finance banker. So, a lot of opportunity, to put these companies together. The
excitement level is high and looking forward to the future.

Hey, just to be clear, either Tom or John, the custodial deposits, when do you expect them to kind of draw down
to a near-zero balance? Is that by the end of the year or early next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
We're going to see a big drop in the third quarter because of just the nature of the paydowns that we saw early on
in the portfolio. So, that $6 billion will, there still be a number over the next couple of quarters, but it's going to
drop dramatically. My guess would be in the $1 billion to $2 billion range in the third quarter, and then drop even
further from there. It would – it ends up going to zero if and when the FDIC sells the loans, and if we don't retain
servicing from whoever the new buyer is of that portfolio. So it's just the collection of P&I, and any pay-downs and
then the remittance back to the owner.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Great. I appreciate that. And then, I wanted to follow up on expenses. So, for the full year 2023, we have a $2.0
billion to $2.1 billion guide. Can you just level set, and provide me where we are, relative to that number year-to-
date. I see that $909 million, but I wanted to confirm it because it implies a ramp-up in expenses, for the back half
of this year, and then a pretty significant ramp-down, in 2024, as we think about flattish expenses.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2023
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. So, you're right, when you look at the six months, right we're just under $1 billion right now, given where we
are. If you looked at the second quarter run rate, it's just under $2.1 billion run rate. We will have some expenses,
as Tom had mentioned, that's in this guide, which is included in the new rules that we'll see, later today, most
likely, and then just the normal $100 billion to make sure we're above $100 billion. So, we're going to see some
increased expenses in 2023 for that. And then, we believe once we can get the systems conversions done, that'll
be what allows us to stay pretty close to flat in 2024 when you compare it to 2023. So, as I mentioned early on,
we're going to see a ramp-up, in expenses, in the next couple of quarters. I mentioned that on the last call.
There's a lot of work going on. There's a lot of work being done for the FDIC loans as well. And as you know,
remember that benefit, right now, is showing up in non-interest income. That will drop over time. And as that
drops over time, we'll be able to get some efficiencies on the non-interest expense side, if we're not ended up
servicing those loans, when we get into 2024, depending on what happens with those assets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. So Matt, just one other point, and this is Tom, is that we're also investing into the PCG model. So, we have
some teams coming on board projected into this run rate and that will also commensurate with some good
revenue opportunities, as we go to the break-even, as Eric indicated, we're anticipating a one year breakeven on
bringing the teams on. And from there, we have hurdle rate of returns that we're targeting to 20%-plus over a very
short period of time. So that's also in our run rate. So clearly the First Republic transaction didn't happen, the
guide would be very different. But we're clearly investing in the model, which will have significant deposit

embedded in our forecast.

Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. Okay maybe if we were to think about the back half of 2024, should we think about at that point
getting to a $2 billion to $2.1 billion or right around the same kind of guide range annualized run rate, and expect
kind of a bell curve shape rise and decrease in expenses until then? Is that the way to think about it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I mean, I don't know about bell shape. But yes, I would assume that when we get to the Q3, Q4, 2024 numbers,
we would see all things being equal that those expenses would be lower than Q1 and Q2, right? We're expecting
the Flagstar conversion will be in February of 2024. So, the back half of the year will be more of a run rate kind of
perspective when we get through that. So, I think that's right. I don't think it's dramatic. But I do think that you will
see lower run rate expenses in Q3 and Q4 as compared to Q1 of 2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Okay. Thank you for that color. Last one. Can you just describe the interest rate position of the bank at this
point and how the NIM would respond in call it a down 100 basis point scenario, and whether or not you want to
describe that parallel shift, or just the front end coming down. I would just appreciate some color on asset
sensitivity, liability sensitivity and maybe adjusted for liquidity.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2023
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes, no, absolutely. So, as if you look back to the first quarter, we were moderately to very highly asset-sensitive,
given the amount of cash that was on the balance sheet. We are now slightly asset-sensitive and that asset
sensitivity, just with the passage of time and the utilization of some of the cash on hand and some of the loan
growth that we may see in the back half of the year, we believe will get to very close to neutral. So, we're not an
outlier anymore, as we had been, historically, on the liability side. We think, right now, we're slightly asset-
sensitive with the trend to get a little less asset-sensitive.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. And just one other point, think about the customers on the multifamily CRE side. Naturally, if rates were to
go lower in 2024 our customers are going look to take their floating rate instruments, probably lock in some fixed
rate structure, and then you are going to see a lot of activity, from the portfolio. We had really virtually no
prepayment activity, for the past year. It's been a slow market. So, we anticipate a lot of activity, which will
naturally, organically, put this company in a very interesting position, when it comes to managing interest rate risk,
with the clientele, will be active, if there's a rate change next year. So we're anticipating some activity there, which
can naturally hedge the balance sheet towards neutrality. We want to be agnostic in movement in interest rates.
That's the plan here. We don't want to be liability-sensitive too much or asset-sensitive too much. We want to be
relatively neutral as we make money in any interest rate environment.
Obviously, the goal here was to get to 3%. We think we got here probably a couple of quarters earlier. That's a
positive attribute in the current environment because of the stability of the Signature transaction. But our loan
book is all reacting very favorably, when it comes to spreads. And more importantly, it's a tight credit market,
right? So as I indicated, the loan spread offering, right now, is higher, and we're getting it. And then, that's with
industry-wide. So, there is some tight credit standards and customers have to finance, or we're going to be in the
market, we're in business, and we're comfortable on working with our clients. But the beauty of this opportunity is
that it's a much higher spread.

Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Peter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
I was just wondering, could you give an update on the office portfolio? And then, secondly, just are you seeing
any type of stress on the multifamily portfolio, just between the inflation pressures, higher interest rates, and it's
just harder to increase rents on the rent-stabilized apartments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes, so Peter, I'll start and I'll defer to John, the CFO. But clearly it's been resilient. On the multifamily side, it's
been an environment where, we have a lot of wealthy customers. They're going through this journey, of no
activity. There's a 3% coupon, from the lowest going into, I'd say [ph] close to 7% and 8%. So, there is no a
substantial change (49:06). And they're weathering the storm. They're paying their bills. Like I indicated, probably
65% of loans coming up for decision on their actual maturity and/or repricing, they're choosing a SOFR option.
And they're holding that until they feel it's the right time to lock in a fixed rate structure, which is unusual because
we haven't seen this environment in quite some time, but they are doing well in that environment.
There's no question that the bank is benefiting from that. And they are getting some cash flows adjustments to
their income stream. But these are wealthy customers that have large portfolios. And they're weathering the
storm, they're waiting for low interest rates. And we have tremendous asset quality performance as a result of this
environment, which is a positive discussion point. We can talk, we'll tell you about the fact that it's cash flows are
being squeezed. Of course, the interest rate's going from 3% to 8%, 9% is going to have an impact. But we think
that we're getting close to the point where if we stabilize on the SOFR side, and there is this view that next year
will be the year, where the Feds will have to adjust their policy stance, then customers may be very active on
thinking about the next five years to 10 years of financing.
We're not seeing any late pays. We're not seeing any delinquencies on multifamily. The commercial real estate
portfolio is doing extremely well. It's resilient. We have statistics in the deck. We talked about that. We're not
going to be perfect because obviously it's an environment where it's fluid, but it seems like as we reappraised
buildings, as we get deep into the portfolio, and we deal with some one-up issues, it's been a very resilient
portfolio.
So with that, I'm going to have John go to the statistics. But I will tell you that we're very pleased with the asset
quality given the ramp-up of interest rates. And John, if you want to share some of the statistics on the
commercial side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. And especially, to your question, Peter, on office, right, we do have a slide. We added some additional
information, as we're going to continue to do over time. The portfolio of $3.4 billion really pretty consistent from
the prior quarter, with [ph] average DSVRs and LTVs and average balance (51:06). And we did have just under
40% of our office exposure has been appraised or reappraised in 2022 and 2023. So, there's 15% of its rated
special mention or substandard.

So, the portfolio's been strong. We have seen some early delinquencies. We think the bulk of them will be cleared
in the third quarter. But we are working through a couple of items, as you can imagine. But still it's been very
strong. It's bread-and-butter type lending for us. It's the same structure that we did, and that we've done
historically, for decades, with multifamily, just with a different collateral base. So, very cautiously optimistic about
the portfolio. We have been actually since COVID hit. And if you could see there's really not much coming due in
the rest of 2023 and 2024. So the bulk of the portfolio had – the option or contractual date starting really in 2025
and forward.

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. Thanks. Very helpful. And then, can I just ask a follow-up on the mortgage warehouse? You had nice
growth in mortgage warehouse. Are you able to get deposits, with the mortgage warehouse business? And the
reason I ask is typically fourth quarter tends to be seasonally weak. And so, do those deposits flow out?

Lee, go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Matthew Smith A
Senior Executive VP & President-Mortgage, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. So, I think the answer is yes, we can bring in deposits with the warehouse lending business, as we can with
all lending businesses, and it's a focus of the bank. Tom has been very clear that its deposits, deposits, deposits.
So, the answer is yes, we can bring in deposits from the warehouse customers. I think the other thing that I would
point out is we can bring in more deposits from the mortgage ecosystem. As part of the Signature acquisition, we
acquired a cash and treasury management team that focused on the mortgage ecosystem. And you think of all
the TPOs, we work with 3,500 TPOs, we have 400 warehouse customers. You think of the MSR owners that we
subservice for or we lend to. So, we think there is a big opportunity to bring in more deposits from that mortgage
ecosystem.

Hey, good morning.

Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Chris.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, good morning. John, just a follow-up to a prior comment about the assets or the rate positioning of the
balance sheet. If you zoom out, and just think more holistically, about does the company make more money, in
the down rate environment, could you speak to potentially the opportunity for better loan growth and better
mortgage if the forward curve is right in 2024?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes, I mean, there are a lot of even being slightly asset-sensitive depending on how the curve moves. The other
item to really think about, we talk about asset sensitivity from an NII perspective. But if we see significant declines
in rates, the mortgage banking business, the warehouse business is going to really, really explode from an upside
perspective, and protect that the income that we lose in some of the other areas. So, we also have been – what
Tom mentioned on the multifamily portfolio as well. I mean, you'll see prepayment fees start to pick up
substantially. I mean, we haven't talked about a prepayment fee in quarters now, right, so?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
And that and when we were a much smaller institution, we had a year we made $120 million in prepayment fees.
So, that depending on what happens with the rate curve, there are multiple levers in this balance sheet that can
help in any really in any rate environment. And that's what we're going to continue to strive for, to try to get the
balance sheet as agnostic as possible to interest rates. You can't plan, of course, for everything. But that's the
goal. And you don't forget about that mortgage business, which will absolutely pick up, if we do see, across-the-
board rate declines.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yes, thanks for that. And John, while I have you, just on the accretable yield, if I could for a second, could you
help us with what's in your guide for the back half of the year? I think you said [ph] 25 came in from 75 from
Signature, but 20 was high (55:37). What's the right level? And what's left to kind of burn through over the next
several quarters?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2023
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. So, the easiest way to look at if you combine the two, the actual for the second quarter was about $100
million, and in the guide is about $70 million, on a combined basis. And just given the way purchase accounting
works, that'll slowly decline over time with the exception of paydowns, right? Paydowns depending on what kind of
loans pay down, you could see some spikes in that number. But that's what we're in our guide. We think it's
conservative. And, like I said, it is dependent on the market, what happens with interest rates and what happens
with paydowns. But, that $50 million or so from Signature that we're now expecting is higher than we originally
anticipated. And it's just the nature of the portfolio, and the speed that portfolio seems to be paying down at.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
That's helpful. And what's the total pool that will come back to you over the next couple of years? What's the
remaining balance and accretion?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, on the loan side, originally, the Signature piece was over $700 million. So, we still have to have almost $1
billion in total in loan marks when you look at both banks. But I'll make sure I get that number, I'll make sure we
get that out there, for everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
So on the balance sheet, so you've obviously had a huge transformation over the past year and you've been very
clear, John, about the custodial deposits coming out, some higher cost borrowings coming out the second half
too. But beyond that, are there any big structural changes on the horizon, we should be thinking about? Are we
finally getting to more or less steady states, where it's loans and deposits that are just going to drive net interest
income?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes, I think that's right. I mean, you can see in the deposits that we have the wholesale borrowings that we have
maturing in the next couple of quarters and even next year, they're not at high rates. So it's much more of
business as usual. And let's use these deposit funds that we bring in to fund loan growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
And, over time, could we look at paying down wholesale borrowings? Of course, we always could. But there's
other options and some high cost funding you could always look to reposition. And that would be a great problem
to have, if the demand deposits continue to grow. But I think you're right in the fact that that paydown of the high
cost borrowings that we did in the second quarter, that's behind us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes, I would just add to that, Steven, one point, this is Tom, that the reality when we look at building out the teams
and focusing on the PCG model, 40% to 50% type of statistics has been the track record, for deposit inflows, of
demand money. So every dollar bringing in, I think we're forecasting 40%, but the reality is more like 50%. That's
going to be a significant catalyst as we change the mix of our deposit funding going forward. At the same time,
we're focusing on compensating balances amongst all the lines of businesses and we're going after operating
accounts, payroll accounts. We really feel confident that if we're going to put our capital at risk, we want to make
sure we have the relationships. So that's going to be a relationship-driven model. And that's where we're heading
for all of our lines of businesses. And that's how we're hurdling our returns on loan by loan basis. That's a sea
change on culture here. And I think it's refreshing to have that capability now, having diversified portfolios, we can
allocate capital too, focusing on deposits gathering.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yes. And then, on the NIM, I think we all understand why the NIM is coming down in the third quarter. And
typically, you don't go beyond that. But do you feel the bias is still to the upside, right there, is some unusual NIM
activity, because of these custodial deposits? So, once we get beyond that, do you feel like, at least over the
near-term, you should see some expansion?

Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, what I said, a quarter ago, is that we think we get to that [ph] 3% type, net NIM (59:42) by year-end. Maybe
we got there a couple of quarters earlier. And, I mean, you take that model, and you look at the expense base,
and the size of the balance sheet, and put a reasonable return on that, on average balance, going forward, you
have an environment that we've done really well in when it comes to growing the [ph] NIM from, well, quite
honestly, in the high 2s, right (60:01). So, if we get to the mid to low 3s, as more of a holistic view of the business
model, based on the funding mix that we bring to the table, as we grow the business, it's a different run rate,
right?
So, I think that's something that accelerated here, and given the lines of businesses, and we talked about the fact
that our loan growth has higher spreads, we think that 3%-plus type margin is reasonable and that's the target.
But we got there a little bit sooner. So, we're excited about that. It really has lot to do with the market as well.
There's definitely a credit tightening in the system. And the Fed was talking about that publicly. There's no
question that money is expensive and we're getting paid for the risk and more importantly, that'll impact stronger
margins for this company.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Thanks good morning, guys. How are you doing? So real quick, just on the cash position, still strong at $16 billion.
Sounds like the borrowing paydown, the low-hanging fruit has been picked. But just curious, what opportunities do
you have to optimize the margin with that excess cash, and then more longer-term, where does that – what is
your minimum cash position versus that 13% of assets today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. So, we look at cash and unencumbered securities together from an on-balance sheet liquidity perspective.
And, right now, we're very comfortable with where we are. The utilization of the cash and the benefits that we can
get that can drive it forward, we do have, you know, the wholesale borrowing trade, as I mentioned, with the high
cost wholesale borrowings, that we took care of in Q2. We do have some high-cost brokered CDs that we can
always deal with in order to try to maximize and benefit the margin. But I think the real benefit in the longer-term
focus is what can we do on the deposit side? And if we can continue to bring in non-interest bearing demand
deposits? That's going to be the driver of margin growth in the future. How successful we are at that will drive that,
will drive the margin story.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
And I would just also add just on a perspective, our balance sheet, if you think about banks over $50 billion, we're
probably the lowest percentage of securities assets in the country right now by design.

Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
We have no held to maturity portfolio, we don't believe in it. We're very comfortable with [ph] putting in net assets,
but we have limited exposure there (64:36). But we have a very small book that needs to be right sized over time,
as we go into the $100 billion standard. So, that's another area that probably will generate some additional
revenues for the company as we right-size ourselves to the industry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Got you. Okay and just last one for me. Apologies if I missed this, but the Signature teams of the 127 that you
guys acquired, what is that number today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric Howell A
Senior Executive Vice President and President of Commercial and Private Banking, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
That's what the numbers...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
[ph] I think, we started that at 130 (65:07). We had a handful that ran off. Again, the deposits are stable, but
what's interesting about the story here is that since our last public release, we had full stability. There hasn't been
any exits at all. And it's been an encouraging experience. As Eric said, the team is motivated, we're focused on
building back the business, getting the clients back into the higher average balances. But the accounts are still
here. A lot of the money has moved to different funding vehicles, to try to get out of the system, because of the
insurance issue. But we – and Eric, you may want to talk about some of the strategies we had on off balance
sheet that's also accommodating some of the customers right now, come back to us.

Eric Howell A

Yes, I mean, that's really the new go-to market, right where, look, the clients, like Tom said, the clients didn't close
their accounts. They just moved their funds out, right? And they're finding it very difficult, very difficult to do
business at the mega institutions that they moved to. So we're seeing the operating accounts come back, and
that's why we had DDA up this quarter, right? And so that's starting to flow back, as they just they can't run their
businesses at these other institutions, right? And then, on the excess funds that we normally keep an on balance
sheet money market funds for them, they're bringing those back some on balance sheet, and some off balance
sheet, into an array of off balance sheet money market funds that we have available for those clients, right? So
we're going to start making some serious fee income on that, which doesn't tie up capital, right? And really juices
our returns. So that's the new go-to market. Clients are reacting very to that. They're recognizing that we can
continue to control the entire client experience for them while also giving them that safety. So, we're seeing
successes there, across the board, quite frankly. Every time I talk to a team, I hear about how unhappy their
clients are elsewhere and how they're starting to come back.

order through the summer, where pre-March in totality as we continue to evaluate and sign on and onboard the
First Republic talent that's in the marketplace, as there is a dislocation that we are competitively looking to put on
