Q1 2021 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2021
Phillip D. Green
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thanks, A.B. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll review first quarter results for
Cullen/Frost and our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas will provide some additional comments before we open
it up to your questions.
In the first quarter, Cullen/Frost earned $113.9 million or $1.77 a share compared with earnings of $47.2 million or
$0.75 a share reported in the same quarter last year, and $88.3 million or $1.38 a share in the fourth quarter of
2020. In a very challenging economic environment, our team not only continued to execute on our strategies, but
also achieved some extraordinary accomplishments that I'll discuss in detail as we go through the call.
Economic impacts of the pandemic continue to affect loan demand. Overall, average loans in the first quarter
were $17.7 billion, an increase of 18% compared with $15 billion in the first quarter of last year. But excluding
PPP loans, first quarter average loans of $14.9 billion represented a decline of just over 1% compared to the first
quarter of 2020. Average deposits in the first quarter were $35.4 billion and they were an increase of 30%
compared to $27.4 billion in the first quarter of last year. Obviously, macroeconomic factors over the past year
have impacted our deposit growth, but it's also been our experience over our history that [indiscernible] (00:03:06)
Frost, that we're a safe haven for customers in times of uncertainty.
Our return on average assets and average common equity in the first quarter were 1.09% and 11.13%,
respectively. We did not record a credit loss expense related to loans in the first quarter after recording a credit
loss expense of $13.3 million in the fourth quarter. Our asset quality outlook is stable and experienced a
meaningful improvement during the first quarter. In general, problem assets are declining in number and new
problems have dropped significantly and are at pre-pandemic levels.
Net charge-offs for the first quarter dropped sharply to $1.9 million from $13.6 million in the fourth quarter.
Annualized net charge-offs for the first quarter were just 4 basis points of average loans. Non-performing assets
were $51.7 million at the end of the first quarter, down 17% from the $62.3 million at the end of the fourth quarter
and a year ago non-performers stood at $67.5 million.
Overall, delinquencies for accruing loans at the end of the first quarter were $106 million or 59 basis points of
period end loans, that's stable when compared to the end of 2020 and comparable to what we've experienced in
the past several years. Of the $2.2 billion and 90-day deferrals granted to borrowers that we've discussed on
previous calls, only about $11 million remain in deferment at the end of the first quarter.
Total problem loans, which we define as risk grade 10 and higher, were $774 million at the end of the first quarter
compared with $812 million at the end of the fourth quarter. Energy-related problem loans continue to decline and
were $108.6 million at the end of the first quarter compared to $133.5 million for the previous quarter. To put that
in perspective, total problem energy loans peaked at nearly $600 million early in 2016.
In general, energy loans continued to decline as a percentage of our portfolio, falling to 7.5% of our non-PPP
portfolio at the end of the first quarter. As a reminder, that figure was 8.2% at the end of the fourth quarter and the
peak was 16% back in 2015. We continue to work hard to rationalize our company's exposure to the energy
segment to appropriate levels.
Overall, we find that credit quality is improving. When the pandemic started last year, we assembled teams to
analyze the non-energy portfolio segments that we considered the most at risk, which included restaurants,

hotels, entertainment, sports, and retail. The total of these portfolio segments, excluding PPP loans, represented
just $1.6 billion at the end of the first quarter, and our loan loss reserve for these segments was 4.9%.
The credit quality of individual credits in these segments is mostly stable or better compared to the end of the
fourth quarter, and the outlook is improving, although macroeconomic trends impacting some segments will take
time to fully digest. The hotel segment, where we have $286 million outstanding, remains our most at-risk
category. However, we believe our exposure to any significant loss is minimal.
I'm very proud of our team's ability to build relationships with new customers in challenging times, particularly
when so much effort was put into helping existing small business customers get PPP loans. During the first
quarter, we added 55% more new commercial relationships than we did in the first quarter of last year. A good
portion of those mentioned PPP is the reason they came to Frost, but even more of them were just from the
continued hard work by our bankers and the level of service that we provide.
New loan commitments booked during the first quarter, excluding PPP loans, were down by 16% compared to the
first quarter of 2020, which was before the economic impact of the pandemic had been felt. So this comparison
clearly shows the impact of the pandemic on loan demand.
Regarding new loan commitments booked, the balance between these relationships was nearly even with 49%
larger, 51% core at the end of the first quarter. We will continue to keep this balance in mind. In total, the
percentage of deals lost to structure was 70% and it was fairly consistent with the 73% we saw this time last year.
However, keep in mind, we believe that's a higher number and it illustrates the competition out there through
underwriting. Our weighted current active loan pipeline in the first quarter was up about 1% compared with the
end of the fourth quarter. So, though modest, it was good to see some improvement.
Consumer banking also continues to see outstanding growth. Overall, our net new consumer customer growth
rate for the first quarter was up 255% compared to the first quarter of 2020 255%. Same-store sales, as
measured by account openings, were up by 18% through the end of the first quarter when compared to the first
quarter of 2020 and up a non-annualized 11% on a linked-quarter basis.
In the first quarter, 36% of our account openings came from our online channels, including our Frost mobile app.
We believe this compares very well to the industry. Online account openings were 35% higher when compared to
the first quarter of 2020. Consumer loan portfolio was $1.8 billion at the end of the first quarter, up by 1.4%
compared to the first quarter of last year.
We're nearing the completion of our previously announced Houston expansion. We opened 20 – well, we opened
the 23rd of the planned 25 new financial centers in April. And the remaining two will be open in the coming weeks.
Overall, the new financial centers are exceeding our expectations. This is one of the extraordinary
accomplishments that I mentioned earlier. Our team's performance of keeping the momentum going in Houston
despite the pandemic and all the work we put into PPP is a true credit to our outstanding staff.
Now, let me share with you where we stand with the expansion as of March for the 22 locations we had opened at
that time, and it excludes PPP loans. Our numbers of new households were 144% of target and represents over
8,700 new individuals and businesses. Our loan volumes were 212% of target and represented $263 million in
outstanding.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2021
Let's look at the mix of this portfolio. About 85% represent commercial credits with about 15% consumer. They
represent just under half C&I loans, about a quarter investor real estate, 15% consumer, and around 10% non-
profit and public finance. Finally, with only three loans over $10 million, over 80% are core loans.
Now, let's look at deposits. At $343 million, they represent 114% of target. They represent about two-thirds
commercial and one-third consumer. We've seen increasing momentum over the last year when we were about
68% of our target. What I hope this demonstrates and what's important to understand is that the character of the
business we are generating through the expansion is very consistent with the overall company. It's just what we
do. And you can see that its profitability will be driven by small and mid-sized businesses.
I'm extremely proud of what our organization has been able to do in Houston. And I believe you should be too.
We've built a platform that will add shareholder value for years to come. And that's why I'm happy to share that we
will be taking the lessons and skills we've learned in the Houston market to a very similar opportunity we have
before us in Dallas early next year with 25 new locations over a 30-month period. This will put us on a path to
triple our number of locations in that dynamic market over that time.
Turning now to PPP, our team was ready to respond when SBA reopened the application process in January. To-
date, we've taken in about 12,400 new loan applications in the second round of PPP, with over $1.3 billion
funded. Combined with our total from the first round last year, we funded more than 31,000 loans or $4.6 billion,
just amazing. We've also been working hard to help those borrowers get loans forgiven. We've invited all of the
round 1 borrowers to apply for forgiveness and we've submitted 70% of those loan balances to the SBA and we
received forgiveness on about 50% already. Because this process is vital to our borrowers, we're doing all the
work in-house with Frost Bankers. We haven't outsourced any of these efforts.
We're excited to announce that on April 15, we've launched a new feature for our consumer customers called
$100 overdraft grace. This feature is an investment in our organic growth strategy. And at the same time, we
believe it will make a difference on our customers' lives. It clearly sets us apart from both traditional bank
competitors and neobanks. As a result, we expect it to further increase the rate of new customer growth in our
already growing consumer bank.
Also this month, we received some good news from third-party organizations that assess our customer service.
The Greenwich Excellence Awards, where Frost has had the highest scores for superior service, advice and
performance to small business and middle market banking clients for four consecutive years, let us know that our
already high overall satisfaction and Net Promoter Scores went up even higher over 2020, while many of our
competitors saw declines.
And I'm very pleased to let you know that J.D. Power & Associates just this week announced that Frost once
again received the highest ranking in customer satisfaction in Texas in the retail banking satisfaction study. That's
the 12th consecutive year we've had the highest scores in Texas.
When you put it all together, the solid financial results, the healthy numbers in deposits and loans, all the new
relationships, the goodwill from our PPP efforts, the Houston expansion, and the customer service accolades, it
shows that when we care about customers and work to be a force for good in their everyday lives, we'll be
rewarded. And I don't just mean rewarded in a financial sense, I mean in the sense that people recognize that
we're doing something important and we're doing it better than just about anyone else.

2020 was a tough year and 2021 hasn't been easy so far, but things are looking up and that's due to everything
that our employees have been doing for our company and our customers in these difficult times, and I'm very
optimistic about our outlook. Appreciate all their hard work and I'm proud of them and I'm proud to be at Frost.
Now, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas for some additional comments.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thank you, Phil. Looking first at our net interest margin, our net interest margin percentage for the first quarter
was 2.72%, down 10 basis points from the 2.82% reported last quarter. The decrease was impacted by a higher
proportion of earning assets being invested in lower yielding balances at the Fed in the first quarter as compared
to the fourth quarter, partially offset by the positive impact of the PPP loan portfolio. Interest-bearing deposits at
the Fed earning 10 basis points averaged $9.9 billion or 25% of our earning assets in the first quarter, up from
$7.7 billion or 20% of earning assets in the prior quarter. Excluding the impact of PPP loans, our net interest
margin percentage would have been 2.59% in the first quarter, down from an adjusted 2.75% for the fourth
quarter.
The taxable equivalent loan yield for the first quarter was 3.87%, up 13 basis points from the previous quarter.
Excluding the impact of PPP loans, the taxable equivalent loan yield would have been 3.77%, basically flat with
the prior quarter.
Average loan volumes in the first quarter of $17.7 billion were down $260 million from the fourth quarter average
of $17.9 billion. Excluding PPP loans, average loans in the first quarter were down about $184 million or 1.2%
from the fourth quarter, with about three quarters of that decrease related to energy loans.
To add some additional color on our PPP loans, as Phil mentioned, we funded over $1.3 billion of round 2 PPP
loans during the first quarter. This was offset by approximately $580 million in forgiveness payments during the
quarter on round 1 loans, bringing our total round 1 forgiveness payments to approximately $1.4 billion.
At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $73 million in net deferred fees remaining to be recognized
with about one-third of this related to round 1 loans. With respect to round 2 loans, given the smaller dollar size of
the loan and changes in the forgiveness process, we expect this portfolio to have a shorter average life than the
round 1 portfolio. As a result, we currently expect about 90% of the remaining net deferred fees to be recognized
this year.
Looking at our investment portfolio, the total investment portfolio averaged $12.2 billion during the first quarter,
down about $335 million from the fourth quarter average of $12.6 billion. The taxable equivalent yield on the
investment portfolio was 3.41% in the first quarter, flat with the fourth quarter. The yield on the taxable portfolio,
which averaged $4 billion, was 2.06%, down 6 basis points from the fourth quarter as a result of higher premium
amortization associated with our agency mortgage-backed securities given faster prepayment speeds, and to a
lesser extent, lower yields associated with recent purchases.
Our municipal portfolio averaged about $8.2 billion during the first quarter, down $154 million from the fourth
quarter with a taxable equivalent yield of 4.09%, flat with the prior quarter. At the end of the first quarter, 78% of
the municipal portfolio was pre-refunded or PSF insured.
Investment purchases during the first quarter were approximately $500 million and consisted about – of about
$200 million each in treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, respectively, with the remainder being

municipals. Our current projections only assume that we make investment purchases of about $1.4 billion for the
year, which will help us to offset a portion of our maturities and expected prepayments in [ph] costs (00:20:38).
Regarding non-interest expense, looking at the full-year 2021, we currently expect an annual expense growth of
something around the 3.5% to 4% range from our 2020 total reported non-interest expenses.
In regard to the estimates for full-year 2021 earnings, given our first quarter results and our assumption of similar
to improving credit metrics to those we saw in the first quarter, we currently believe that the current mean of
analyst estimates of $5.42 is too low.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Phil for questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thanks, Jerry. I'll now open it up for questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
All right, great. Thank you. I guess, the first question in terms of the allowance for credit losses ex-PPP, it looks
like in your press release, you said it went up 2 basis points, I believe, to 1.77%. Can you just talk about why it
went up? I mean, just given the context that most of the banks are materially releasing reserves. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Sure, Ken. Obviously, you know Frost, you followed us for a long time, obviously very conservative. We continue
to be concerned about what's going on in certain industries, commercial real estate, for example. And just given
where we are and the expectation of what could still come, whether that be variant, whether that be issues
associated with office buildings and whether employees come back to work, whether that's related to hotels and
lodging, I think we just felt like it was too early in the process to release reserves.
Our modeling results in the commercial real estate category would actually have – we would have required, if you
will, from a modeling standpoint that we have a lower reserve associated with them. But really in our evaluation,
we created a management overlay just given the challenges that we potentially see out there in some of those
COVID-impacted industries.
And so I think Phil mentioned the COVID-impacted industries there. They are still out there at $1.5 billion. We've
got a reserve associated with them at $4.9 billion. So I think part of it is just we're not out of the woods and don't
feel like we're out of the woods. And so, now didn't really feel the need and certainly felt like we could substantiate
the allowance that we've got on our books. And obviously, through rest of the year, we'll continue to look at that.
We didn't book a credit expense in the first quarter. Given what we're seeing today, I don't expect to have a
provision, to be quite honest with you, assuming the same sort of credit metrics that we saw in the first quarter.

But again, a lot of it will be just dependent on what our credit quality people are doing, our special assets people
are doing, and what they're seeing in the marketplace. But at this point, given what we were seeing and what we
were feeling, we felt like keeping our reserve basically flat is the way I looked at it to go from 1.75% to 1.77%,
basically flat I thought was a good place for us to be.
You did note that we only had $2 million in net charge-offs during the quarter. We were helped by pretty strong
recoveries. We actually had recoveries of $4 million. So, again, I think we're comfortable with where we're at and
certainly are looking towards the rest of the year and hoping that things continue to improve. And as we go
through each of the quarters, we'll continue to evaluate our allowance and react accordingly.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Certainly makes sense. And then just my follow-up question, sort of a two-part question, I guess, in terms of
expenses, it looks like expenses came in noticeably lower than probably us and consensus were expecting. So
first question is what drove the lower expenses this quarter? But the second part is can you just talk about the
incremental expenses related to the Dallas expansion, and when do they start? Are they already part of your 2021
estimate – sorry, your guidance that you gave? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Sure. Regarding the Dallas expansion, I think Phil noted that we really wouldn't start that until next year, and we
don't give any sort of guidance on 2022. If you're looking for any sort of an impact, what I would suggest you do is
go back to kind of what we said about the Houston expansion. I think, at that point, we had talked about the first
year results was like a $0.19 negative impact given the fact that expenses start before the operations. And I think
in that case, we were talking about 25 branches in two years; this one, we're talking about a little bit longer
extended period, I think we said for over 30 months. But I think that's the sort of color and work that I would do if I
was on your end if you were trying to put some dollars into your 2022 estimates.
As far as expenses for the quarter, just a reminder, we did have some deferred fees associated with the
origination of the PPP loans. I think that number was, I was trying to get it here, if I remember correctly, it was like
$4.8 million that was actually capitalized and gets netted against the fees and accreted into interest. So that's
obviously having an impact. But in addition to that, we had our processes in place and our program in place to
reduce expenses last year. I think the team did a good job, you heard us talking about that. So I think we're
seeing some of that impact as well in the first quarter. And so we'll continue to keep our eyes focused on
expenses. So that's really I guess how I'd say. Did you have another question there? I can't remember the third
part.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Oh, no, actually you addressed both parts of my expense question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Your next question is from Jennifer Demba from Truist Securities. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Hi. Thank you. In terms of the Dallas branch expansion, what kind of loans and deposit growth would you expect
from those offices? Would it be materially different from the Houston expansion or roughly the same?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Jennifer, I'm going to say it's going to be roughly the same in our view right now. Given how competitive our
Dallas and Houston markets are, I can't imagine our Dallas cohorts would let Houston outshine them there. So I
think it will be pretty much the same here. Dallas is really a tremendous market for business, particularly small
and mid-sized business. And I think it's going to be really a great expansion force. I think it will be – in my opinion,
I think it will be at least as good as our Dallas expansion – our Houston expansion.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Any lessons learned from the Houston expansion that you'll bring forward for the [ph] Dallas one (00:28:07) that
you picked up over the last couple of years as the world has shifted a little bit?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I think the one lesson you learn – and it's basic. It's about people. That's the number one thing. You want to
hire people that are consistent with your culture who are excited about being part of an organization like ours. And
if you do the right job, hiring people in these submarkets, they can really be successful with everything that we
bring to the table supporting them. I think that's been the best thing to learn.
The other thing we've learned is we're getting pretty good at bringing them on. And I want to emphasize every
time that we're not bringing on teams – we're not lifting teams out and putting them in our organization. We're
talking to individuals and people that believe in what we're doing and want to be a part of it. And we're also finding
that when you do that well, that you begin to get follow-on from people in the organizations that have come over
and said, hey, this is what we thought it would be. And I know this person or that person who'd be really great with
this.
And so you're not – I mean, you have a little bit more certainty about who you're bringing on and the fit as you
move through the strategy. I think that's what we've seen in Houston. And we'll continue to expand in Houston.
There's some submarkets that we want to be in that we didn't pick up on the first time and just do a regular – just
growing our business, we're going to want to continue to expand there. And I think that we've got good

momentum there and we've got good follow on, like I talked about in that market. So, I feel like that's going to be
successful. But that's one thing. I think that we've learned.
And the other thing I'd say, Jennifer, is it's really important to go through the steps. Don't skip steps. We know
what we need to do to develop a market. We know that we need to be there early with the community leaders like
six months early before we open up the branch. We surround them with a team. We get them involved. And if you
have a market where you – where we – I think one of our really early one in Houston, we had someone leave
earlier, we weren't able to close on bringing in a community leader. And that branch was – it suffered early on
because you couldn't do all the steps that you needed. So, we're really focused on bringing the people on.
And while Jerry mentioned correctly that there won't really be much of an impact this year of that expansion, we
hope to open our first location in January of next year in Dallas, there's a lot of effort that we've been undertaking
to understand the submarkets we want to be in and there'll be even more effort about bringing all the right people
for those markets. And there's a whole lot of spadework that has to happen before you actually execute this stuff.
I'm so excited about doing it, so I'm really looking forward to what it's going to be for us.

I want to first follow up on the increase in new commercial relationships that you cited for the first quarter. Are
these customers coming from banks of all sizes or is there one cohort struggling more than others now to retain
customers? And maybe can you include in your response what is the friction point that these customers are
signing when they're moving over to Frost?

Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, the main source of these relationships, not the only, but the main source is what I call the too big to fail the
big three, let's say. And I hesitate to say that there's any one that is providing a much greater share than any
other. We choose to compete against those three banks in the Texas market and it's not an accident. And we – to
be honest, we compete very well with them and we're not afraid of competing with them. And so that's – it makes
sense to me that that's where we'd see most of our new relationships.
And then your – second part of your question. I'm sorry, Steve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
It was what's the friction point like when they move over. It's such a big increase that you're seeing in the year.
And I'm just curious what are they citing in terms of it's a bigger deal to move a commercial relationship than
consumer. So when they're moving it, what's sort of the straw that broke the camel's back? Why now they're
moving or are you seeing more customers move to you now?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I'd say it's PPP. I mean, more than anything else, it matters where you bank. It's like a woman that totally she
didn't realize 13 years ago that where she opened a checking account would be an existential decision for her
business and whether she could get a PPP loan when she needed it. And that really is I think the biggest outsized
reason we're seeing. I've got a number in here somewhere about how many of these relationships were from
PPP.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. Phil, if I can chime in just a bit.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
The other thing we've heard in the case of the PPP loans is that in some cases, it's some of our customers that
had successful PPP experiences with us referring some of their friends and prospects. And in other cases, people
had such a bad experience at their bank with PPP and have heard the successes we've had and how easy it was
to get it done with us that we've seen them come in that way.
And the other thing that I've heard mentioned also as far as they're moving over is really in some cases, some of
those too big to fail, as Phil mentioned, are really referring some of these customers more to call centers. So they
don't necessarily have that same relationship manager that they could call and look in the eye, shake hands with
or go to lunch with sort of thing. And so, because of their size, in some cases, they're being deferred more to call
centers. We've heard that come up as well.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
That's helpful. To shift gears, so looking at the new program for overdraft, which is interesting, when you say with
that program that customers need to make a deposit after the overdraft, you say as soon as possible. What
exactly does that mean? A couple of your peers that have launched that give 24 hours. But what does that mean
as soon as possible?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, first of all, that's not our program. Our program is that if you've got a direct deposit with us, that deposit is at
least $500 a month, we'll pay you overdraft of $100 or less and we won't charge you fee.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Okay. I thought I saw there making a deposit. I might have been referencing something else.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
So I think it was...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. It's a direct deposit.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
...direct deposit.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. You have to have a direct deposit.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Just a direct deposit as soon as...
[indiscernible] (00:35:43)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
In order to qualify. Direct deposit, you qualify for the program.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. And so once you establish a direct deposit, you qualify for the program.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
And the reason that's how we would define the relationship that way, right? If you got a direct deposit, you got a
relationship and you get that benefit.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got you. And then just finally on this program, what's the anticipated reduction in service charge revenue from the
program? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I think the number that we're projecting is I think we looked at this first quarter and we saw that our
consumer NSF OD fees would be down about $1 million. So, I think that's about 17% of what we saw in the
quarter. Obviously, going forward, a lot of it will be dependent on the sort of activity we have, but that's what we
saw the impact in the first quarter − would have been in the first quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. So Jerry, what's the full-year impact, just the full-year revenue impact?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Well, I guess I would say that's going to be dependent on the volumes, right? So if it's $1 million for a quarter,
then, yeah, it could potentially be less than that. Just depending on – less or more depend on the activity.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. So, not material. Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I don't think it's going to be significant. I think that the – you got two things going on when you look at the overdraft
line. As activity picks up, you're going to see overdraft activity pick up anyway. And so really what we're doing is
we're investing what some of that increase would have been and I think we could be sort of flattish versus 2020
on overdraft fees. We'll see how it what happens. It's a new program. We'll see how it goes. But I think it's really a
good opportunity to differentiate ourselves.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. Terrific. Thanks for taking my questions.

We know who you are, Brady.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
That's right. Yeah. I wanted to start just with the amount of cash that you are all sitting on. You're sitting on $10
billion of cash that's basically earning zero and that's a huge lever for you all to pull at some point to start to move
those funds into the bond book where obviously the yields are higher. Maybe just talk about how you think about
when is the right time to pull that lever. And if you look at the yield curve today and it's off, but it's still not great.
So do we start to see that today or do you wait for rates to go a little higher?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Hey, Brady. Let me just talk a bit about it. I think the short answer is we're going to wait a little longer. I believe
that the – we could be wrong, but our gut is that we're seeing rates increase. I mean, we made this decision in
August last year when the tenure is 80 basis points or so and it's paid off for us. We're not great bond traders. We
just believe that with the economy opening up with the amount of fiscal stimulus, it's in there, the monetary
stimulus. It just makes sense that we're going to see this impact and we just don't want to bet – we're going to be
employing shareholders' money, we're going to be smart about doing it.
I would think it's going to be later in this year. Yeah. I would guess maybe later third quarter, but it could be later. I
think we're – our bet is we're going to see some increased rates as just things open up and things improve. And I
think that Fed's willing to accept that. And so we're going to – that's the way we're going to lean.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2021
I really feel one of the things that I'm really proud of the organization for doing is with the reduction in expenses
that we talked about last quarter where we had basically $70 million in 2020's run rate, $50 million follow-on in
2021, that's about $120 million worth of expenses. It really gave us the ability, I think, to maintain this optionality.
We've got the – it's provided us some operating leverage to frankly take a wait and see. And it's paying off for us.
And I'd say, Brady, that I'm really optimistic about our outlook. I think the view we've got for the next several years
for the business and we could be wrong and like I say, there's I think it was George Foreman that might have said
it, everyone's got a plan until you get hit in the mouth. But we did some heavy lifting with expenses. It gave us the
ability to wait on this liquidity bill. We've got this liquidity bill that's there. Jerry, what's our current number now?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
We're at $12 billion, Phil.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Around $12 billion now in the Fed, and I think we employ this later this year that will help us some this year, but
it's also going to help us as we move into 2022. I'm not very optimistic on loan growth. Through the rest of this
year, we could see some. But I mean, businesses got tons of liquidity and I'd love to see some, but I'm not going
to bet on it.
But I think – later in the year, I think we could see it and I think in 2022, we're going to see it. And I think that could
build some momentum in 2022 going into 2023. The Fed has said that they'll beginning increasing rates in 2023.
Maybe they can wait that long, but let's say they do. I think that's going to give us some tremendous tailwinds as
far as that develops and then as we move pass that, [indiscernible] (00:41:53) 2023, 2024 and so, we've got these
investments that we've made in the Houston market that'll be mature at that point. And we'll be beginning to see
some maturity in some of the Dallas investments. So, I really feel, in my opinion, things set up very well for us if
that's the scenario that we get and that's what I'm hoping we'll see.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah, that makes sense. Then longer-term, I mean, if you look in the first quarter, cash to average earning assets
was 25%. It sounds like it's even higher than that as of today. But where would you like to keep that longer-term? I
think pre-COVID, that was running about 5% to 7% of average earning assets. Does that feel like a more
normalized level of cash to earning assets?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. Brady, I think we've been running just a little bit above that. We weren't in the double-digits. So I would
have – if you would ask me, I thought we were in the 8% range typically.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
No, I was going to say yeah, for us, it's just – we've always been a little bit different, right? We typically have more
liquidity than most. But yeah, right now, where we're at is really way up there and yeah, not something that we
would expect to have longer term. And I think something in the mid to high single-digits it's where we'd be.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then, Phil, congrats on the Houston expansion and it's exciting to hear about Dallas. You could've
bought a bank in Houston, but you didn't. And you could have bought a bank in Dallas, but you didn't. A lot of
people are talking about Texas being a fairly active geography for M&A. Is Frost kind of out of the M&A game at
this point and more pursuing organic de novo strategy from here of?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think the short answer to that is yes. You never say never on an acquisition. And I've said many times that an
acquisition that would – the only kind of acquisition that would make sense for a company like ours is one that
gives you the ability to execute on organic strategy in a place, creating a platform that you weren't before. And I've
always given the example that North Texas in 1998 was a great example of that with Overton.
But there's no better market that I can think of than the Texas market right now economically. And I think from a
banking standpoint for what we do with business, small business and all. And so, it's – and I'll give you an
example, Brady, on – I was talking about consumer growth, right? Well, let me talk about net new checking
households, all right? This is organic growth. I'm looking at a piece of paper, if you go back to 2018, so I'm looking
at a little over three years, okay? Three years and a quarter, we hit 1,500 net new checking households in a
month. One – basically one-time prior to September of 2020. Okay.
So, from January of 2018 to September 2020, we hit 1,500 net new checking households one-time. If you look at
October through March, we've hit that one, two, three, four times. And one of that – we had the February freeze,
so that shut everything down. We didn't do it there. But I've got 15 – So, you got October, 1,534; December,
1,851; January, 2,178; and March, 3,178 net new checking households.
That's why we're focused on organic growth and Houston has been a help for that in that growth. And the things
that we're doing with regard to like the overdraft – $100 overdraft grace, that's going to catch people's attention.
We've gotten good at digital marketing. And, so that's why I don't want to be spending a lot of shareholders'
money to throw the long ball and hope something good happens. I'm really confident of what we're doing and I'm
excited about our prospects.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I guess, first, yeah, it's good to see your bank organically investing and being proud of those investments, so it's
good to see you do that. I guess one question, Phil, as we come to the end of our earnings season, you just said
that you're not optimistic of loan growth picking up in this year driven by the liquidity that businesses are sitting on,
which is a little bit of a contrast to what we've heard from, I would say, 75%, 80% of your peers who've talked
about a pickup in the middle of the year. Talk to us in terms of, are you being overly conservative when you're
messaging this? Or do you think some of your peers might be a little ahead of themselves in expecting a loan
growth rebound in the summer?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Ebrahim, I'm a Frost Banker, so I'm going to be a little conservative. But we are seeing some pickup in
commercial real estate, I will say that. But the C&I still – we really haven't seen it. Our – we have something we
call look to book. How many looks are we getting, what are we booking? And community banking was down about
12% – well, about 6% on what they booked. A lot of our declines year-over-year in terms of booking, we had a
70% decline in public finance because we had a great year. Last year, we had a couple of really large deals. But
we had a 40% decline in energy and that's on purpose. So, we're just trying to rationalize our position there. So
some of it is we're – some of it is energy. I like to say some of it's public finance. I still think that businesses are

being careful with expansion. And I think the supply chain issues are real. It might be keeping people from doing
something they would have otherwise done.
And so, I'm just – we have a higher percentage of C&I loans than most people. And since we haven't seen that
come back right now, I'm not that bullish on that for the rest of the year. I could be wrong. By the end of the year,
it could be better. But that's just the way I'm seeing it right now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. Understood. And then just one follow-up, Jerry, on expenses. I guess your guidance implies a ramp-up in
expenses back to, like, the $220 million, $225 million range. Just remind us of the drivers that we – that's going to
drive expenses higher from 1Q levels.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Sure. Let me grab some information here. One thing I will say is one of the things that is impacting growth, of
course, is the Houston expansion. So the Houston expansion by itself is growing non-interest expenses about $10
million. So that is part of it. As we mentioned, the branch openings came on a little bit slower than we expected.
But just looking forward, I guess the things that could affect us going forward, some of it is commission revenues,
of course, associated with certain pieces of the revenue businesses that where revenues were tied with
commissions. So I think we could see some impact there.
Typically, the first quarter is our softest quarter intentionally on advertising and marketing. So we'll see some of
that continue to pick up. It's an area that we've really been extremely cautious about, even as we were managing
our expenses, it wasn't an area that we wanted to go in and slash and burn the marketing budget. We think it's
important to continue to grow customer growth. So you'll see some increases there.
And I think those are probably the two big areas that I would point out and we're going to continue to spend –
continue to spend, I'm sorry, on the first quarter, first quarter you saw an increase in technology, furniture and
equipment and that's just something that we're going to continue to see increases in and it's built into our
numbers.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And Jerry, earlier, you talked about like a $4.8 million PPP related, was that a PPP expense that's running
through the expense line, if you don't mind clarifying that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Sure. No, those are – so under accounting guidance, you capitalize your origination costs. And so there were $4.8
million in origination costs that basically come out of expenses and get netted against the fees and that gets
accreted into income. So other things being equal, expenses would have been – if we did not have those PPP
loans, expenses would have been $4.8 million higher.

David Rochester Q

Just back on the expense guide real quick, just on the Dallas piece. If we go back to like 2018, 2019, take a look
at annual expense growth that was around mid to high single-digits, would you kind of – do you think that's
generally in the ballpark of what you guys are expecting at this point without trying to pin you down to an exact
number?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
We're really kind of hesitant on giving any sort of guidance. I mean, it's really our policy not to give guidance into
the – anything beyond the current year. So I guess, I was really kind of just trying to give you some guidance of
thoughts that you might consider going forward if you kind of look back at the Houston.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I'm glad Jerry pointed that out, too, because one of the things we thought about and we've talked to investors
about, talked to some of you about is that what we're doing right now is we're almost running two companies. It's
one company, one culture. But we have what I call the sort of the core piece of the business which is our very
profitable. It's very efficient, runs very well. And then we've got an expansion piece where we are investing capital,
investing operating leverage into markets for us to grow and that's like any business you invest at and whether it's
a technology business or whether it's any other kind of business. When you're starting something new, it's got a
burn rate associated with it. And if we kind of [indiscernible] (00:54:16) together the expansion piece and the core
piece, it kind of confuses a little bit.
Sometimes it's helpful to us to look at the business on a core basis and then look at it on the expansion basis
because I think both are doing exactly what we intend for them to do. In fact, as we pointed out, maybe better
than we originally intended for them to do. But when you bring them all together, it confuses what's really going on
with the operations of the company.

For example, when Jerry mentioned or when we started, what was it, beginning of 2020, we had a 10% growth
rate in expenses, but a fair amount of that was still in the expansion. And so we don't want to give the wrong
impression that we're loosely spending around here, we're actually pretty tight about it. But a good part of that will
be over time this expansion.

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Yeah. Okay. Appreciate that. Turning back on the question on securities, appreciated your thoughts there on
maybe putting some more cash to work around 3Q or after that. It sounds like you're sort of expecting higher rates
later this year. So I was just curious. Is it a certain level of the tenure you're looking at? Is it 2%-plus? Is it higher
muni rates? Any kind of benchmark to look at to know that you guys are right there and starting to put money to
work? Any other parameters there we can look at? Thanks.

Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I listened to [indiscernible] (00:55:56) yesterday and he was kind of – talked about substantial – words like
substantial improvement, that type of thing. I think we'll know it when we see it. I think directionally, we just expect
to see it move up. And I think that the timing will be right for us later in the year. I mean, personally, I'd be dead
wrong. But I think we'll see [indiscernible] (00:56:22), something in that range over the next several months.
And so, if we don't have to pull the trigger, we won't. But I think – I expect that we probably will begin moving into
the market late third quarter, maybe fourth quarter sometime. I hate to pin ourselves down, but so far it's worked,
knock on wood. And it's our conviction that it'll continue to move that way.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Okay. And maybe one last one, just on loan pricing. Have you guys hit general parity at this point on where new
loan yields coming in versus where the book yield is ex all the PPPs and whatnot?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
No. I would say that that I'll answer it in two ways. What I was really impressed with was from the third quarter to
the fourth quarter, our pricing has really stayed fairly consistent and been pretty strong. And in fact, I've been able
to do that even as the LIBOR continues to go down a couple of few basis points it seems like every quarter. But
when I was looking at the back book versus the current book, I'm still seeing overall about 30 basis points lower
on the new book versus the back.

Operator: Your next question is from Jon Arfstrom from RBC Capital Markets.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks. Good afternoon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Hey, Jon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Jerry, what would you say is like a median or average branch size for your company in terms of deposits?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I'm going to – gosh, let me see if I've got anything here. We are on average, Jon, typically tend to be bigger than
most. So, let me hear it. Hold on a second.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
As you're thinking through it, let me ask [ph] Phil another question (00:58:21).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Any reason why the Houston and Dallas branches can't get to your corporate average? And how long does it take
to get there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Hey, Jon. What I would do when you look at that, I mean, you can do this with the FDIC database, is I would say
yes, there's a reason why there probably wouldn't be the average of our branches because any headquarters
branch in a city tends to be really outsized large. So whenever we look at what we're doing and where we are in
the marketplace, we tend to take out any locations that – for any competitor and ourselves that's $500 million or
more. Okay? And then we look at that as sort of normalized branches, not including headquarters effects. And I
think if you do that, I don't think there's any reason why these locations shouldn't be in line with our other ones
over time.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2021
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Okay. I was just kind of looking for like a median as maybe a way to get to that type of number.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, let me see if I can find anything here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. I guess...
[indiscernible] (00:59:42)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
It looks like it's – yeah, again and I'll ask A.B. to kind of verify with you. I'm kind of going through my tableau stuff
here pretty quickly, but maybe something in the $200 million. But I'll get A.B. to verify that with you. But that's
what I'm seeing based on the report I'm looking at in tableau, but we'll make sure we confirm that with you.
But I think with the exercise that Phil mentioned, is really kind of what we typically do if we're looking at any sort of
a comparison, we'll take out the big downtown centers and then come up with an average that way.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And is the strategy to put branches in areas that are faster growing, I mean, from the outside, we all hear about
this tremendous growth in Texas, but is that the general strategy is to put branches in places that are growing
quickly where you just don't have the presence?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I'd say it depends. There's certainly some that are. We tend to look at without – I guess, I shouldn't throw out all
the secret sauce. But let me just say that we look for areas that are growing. There may be different levels of
growth, but we look for consistent growth in the markets. We like to look at places where, obviously, we're not
located. We think there's tremendous value in that. And it's okay with us if there are a lot of too big to fill
competitors there too because that's who we compete with. And – so, things like that. There are a lot more, but
those are some of the things we look at.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Two more questions here. Do you need to be larger in Austin as well over time?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I think so. I think so. I think the – what we are – I think I mentioned this last time. Austin is really intriguing
to us given what's happening with that market and just the growth, it's just explosive really. But remember, the

strategy that we're employing is a business-centric, small and mid-sized business strategy. That's where the
profitability is driven.
Austin is – there's a lot of rooftops going there. There's some – there's a lot of in-migration of centers like with
Facebook or Indeed or Google, or whatever, Tesla. What we need to see is follow on of small businesses, right?
We don't want to just go there with just a real estate strategy or just a consumer strategy. It's harder to be
profitable with the locations if you've just got a consumer strategy.
I'm confident we're going to see it. It's just that I'm more confident that those are already there in vast numbers in
Dallas. And we'll just have to decide what the payoff will be of a branch expansion strategy in Austin. And we're
going to continue expand in the market but for us to do something, say like we've done in Houston or Dallas, I
think Jerry is still a little bit out on that one.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Last question. How would you compare San Antonio in terms of growth against, say, Dallas or Houston? How
does it stack up?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I would say that Dallas is growing faster and Austin is growing faster. Given what's going on with Houston and the
energy slowdown for a while, I would say we're comparable to Houston. Jerry might have some different thoughts,
but the thing that's great about San Antonio is it doesn't seem to have the high highs or the low lows.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
That's what I was going to say, yeah, exactly.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
It's very stable. It creates lots of cash flow and lots of capital, always has, for us to expand in other markets. It's a
great market to be in. It's great having the market share that we have here and we don't intend to give it up. So
even if it were a little bit slower, it is more stable and it has a lot of benefits in that regard.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. The conversation we had with the Dallas Fed, economists, San Antonio kind of popped out a little bit and
this is just more current data, right? We were looking at March and April information. But the surprising thing there
was how strong San Antonio had performed relatively speaking. I think that was a comment he was making that
he thought that San Antonio had rebounded quicker, but as Phil said, yeah, San Antonio typically doesn't have the
highs or the lows, let's say, a Dallas or a Houston. I think it kind of just tends to chug along a little bit more, more
on the road, but recently, what we were hearing was we performed better than expected.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
All right. All right. Thanks for all the thoughts. Appreciate it.
