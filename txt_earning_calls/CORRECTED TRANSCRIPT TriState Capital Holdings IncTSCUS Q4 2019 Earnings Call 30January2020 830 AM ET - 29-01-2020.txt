James F. Getz
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Good morning and thank you for joining us. Our fourth quarter 2019 results capped off what was a very strong
year for TriState Capital and one in which we achieved a number of meaningful milestones for our company, our
clients, our shareholders and our team. Quarterly and annual revenue reached record levels from organic growth
generated by all three of our business lines. The strength of our business and our engagement with clients, was
at its best.
Our stockholders were rewarded in 2019 for their investment in TriState Capital with the company's shares up
34% last year, well ahead of bank and broad equity market indices. Since our IPO in May 2013, the stock
appreciated a 127% and outperformed bank, asset manager, and general equity market indices by a wide margin.
Even the appreciation of TriState Capital shares in 2019, the stock traded just 13.4 times earnings at year end
indicating further upside potential relative to the market.
Our loans and deposits grew at record rates for both the quarter and the year. Total loans grew organically by
28% in 2019, which each of commercial and industrial, commercial real estate and private banking loan balances
growing to all-time highs. They propelled us well-beyond our $7 billion asset target for 2019.
Lending was fully funded by deposit growth more than 31% during the year and our loan deposit ratio remained
under 100% for the third consecutive quarter. As we continue to add critical mass through responsible organic
growth, we further enhanced the strength of our balance sheet and our ability to invest in our business for the
benefit of all our stakeholders. At Chartwell Investment Partners, client assets under management expanded
during both the quarter and the year to $9.7 billion. As we engaged with new and existing clients benefit from our
managers strong investment performance.
TriState Capital drove record net interest income and non-interest income growth pushing total 2019 revenue up
11% from the prior year. Our organic top line growth also continued to outpace expenses even as we strategically
invest in our business. Pre-tax income grew at a double-digit pace of 14% in 2019 and GAAP earnings per share
grew by 4% to $1.89 for the year. As noted in our earnings release these results were impacted by approximately
$0.03 per share in expenses, which were associated with advanced due-diligence on an investment management
acquisition candidate. These conversations concluded before definitive agreement was reached.
We remain fully committed to our previously disclosed strategy to grow Chartwell through a combination of
organic and acquired means. We will continue to actively evaluate potential candidates for acquisition and
importantly will only consider those, which meet all of our criteria, including cultural compatibility, credible
investment performance, complementary investment products and immediate earnings per share accretion.
In the meantime, Chartwell continues to contribute at least 20% to TriState Capital's total revenue with investment
management fees comprising 69% of non-interest income last year. Through the end of the fourth quarter,
Chartwell's active investment strategies also continued to deliver superior performance. 57% of its products
outperformed their respective benchmarks for the one year period, 92% were ahead for three-year performance,
and 75% were ahead for five-year performance. This track record along with our unique product offering and
outstanding distribution capability is attracting new business.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 30-Jan-2020
During the fourth quarter, Chartwell recorded new business and new flows from existing accounts of
approximately $326 million, which along with market appreciation of $303 million more than offset outflows. As a
result, Chartwell grew assets under management by nearly 6% to $9.7 billion last year, outpacing publicly-traded
traditional asset managers in the US, which reported median organic assets under management growth of about
1%. The pipeline continues to be healthy as it's ever been, and we look forward to continuing to convert this
pipeline into assets under management through 2020.
Turning to Chartwell's revenues in 2019. Investment fees of just over $36 million simply did not meet our organic
growth goal. But longer-term, we believe we have the investment management talent, sales and distribution
capability, and infrastructure to achieve top line growth that's aligned with our expectations.
In the meantime, we're mindful of the need to balance investing in Chartwell's future growth with expense
discipline. This business has been quite profitable since our entry into this space in 2014. And in 2019, we began
taking active measures to measurably and meaningfully enhance Chartwell's contributions to earnings. Chartwell
lowered segment expenses by more than 2% in 2019 from the year before excluding acquisition related costs. In
addition, segment compensation and benefit expenses were lowered by more than 5% in 2019. Overall by the
end of last year, Chartwell had reduced its annual expense run rate by more than $2 million, which will be more
fully reflected in the 2020 results.
At TriState Capital Bank, our commercial business continues to thrive. Middle-market commercial loan balances
approach $3 billion at the year-end, an increase of 27% from one year prior and 35% annualized from September
30, 2019. Period end commercial and industrial loans surpassed a $1 billion for the first time at the end of 2019,
growing by 38% last year.
Commercial real estate loans totaled $1.8 billion increasing 22% in 2019. Even with this impressive performance,
as a percentage of total loans, CRE lending declined to 27% at year-end. Origination activity was very strong
during the fourth quarter with about $188 million from C&I and about $134 million from commercial real estate.
As you saw from our average balance sheet, much of our fourth quarter production took place in December. In
addition, the impact of declining interest rates related to the Fed funds target rate cuts in late September and
October are reflected in our fourth quarter results. Given the timing of production and the more stable current
interest rate environment, we expect the full benefit of our record fourth quarter loan growth to be realized and net
interest income in 2020. We remain very well-positioned to continue our commercial banking success in the
current environment. We're encouraged by our C&I and CRE pipelines and we expect to continue to deliver
strong commercial loan growth during 2020.
Our private banking business achieved exceptional results with the portfolio growing by 29%. We are the nation's
premier provider of marketable securities-based lending with TriState Capital private banking loans offered
through our expanding network of 213 financial intermediary firms and over 60,000 individual advisors. We've
made this strategic investment in people, technology and client experience to secure our market position and we
continue to build the relationships with new individual advisors to our network.
We now have a business development team of about 30 individuals dedicated to growing the national private
banking business. By the end of 2019, we are working with more than 3,000 individual advisors and trust officers
with about 1,200 doing multiple transactions for their clients on our platform last year.
Turning briefly to CECL and its implementation this year, while there are many factors in how it applies to our
business, there are two I'd mention in particular. The first is that well over half of our loans are in TriState Capital's

portfolio of private banking loans collateralized by marketable securities. It's sum 56%. This portfolio has favorable
treatment under regulatory capital requirements and current ALLL methodology similarly. CECL will not require a
reserve for credit loss in this portfolio going forward.
The second factor is our rate and level of new loan production and growth in the commercial part of our lending
business. The calculations for provision amounts under CECL are much more impacted by new loan production
and growth than the pre-existing ALLL methodology. In addition, while our C&I lending has picked up pace, our
commercial real estate lending continues to be a significant source of growth. We expect to continue our history of
double-digit loan growth in these businesses with a continued focus on strong asset quality.
Overall our current efforts at implementing CECL lead us to anticipate that our total allowance will be between 23
basis points and 25 basis points of total loans outstanding. Provision expenses expected to be between $4.5
million and $5.5 million for the year. Separately, we expect a 2020 tax rate between 15% and 16%. Our national
deposit franchise has been successful in keeping pace with our exceptional loan growth. Deposits grew
organically by nearly $1.6 billion last year, through engagement of new and existing clients in diversified channels.
Overall, we continue to maintain flexibility and pricing deposits as evidenced by our approving funding costs in the
first quarter – in the fourth quarter.
Our total cost of funds for all deposits and interest bearing liabilities averaged 1.93% in the fourth quarter, a 25
basis point improvement from the linked third quarter. Borrower's swap fee income continued to be healthy in the
final quarter 2019, totaling some $3.4 million and bringing 2019 swap fees to a $11 million, as we continue to
grow the population of clients who want access to this product to partner with their term loan facilities. As you
know, this type of activity is largely driven by the rate environment. However, it continues to strengthen as we
integrated more indelibly into our growing lending business. In 2019, 24% of swap fees came from private
banking clients compared to 12% of the year before, after we invested very effectively in the offering capability
and client experience in 2018.
We have built this company to last through a strategy of responsible growth emphasizing client focus, discipline,
soundness and profitability. Under the guidance of an experienced leadership team and Board of Directors, we
are pleased to announce that a new Independent Director, Audrey Dunning joined the TriState Capital Board last
week. Audrey is the Founder and CEO of AMP Growth Advisors, and she has spent much of her career focused
on information technology and digital transformation consulting. Audrey currently sits on the Board of Directors for
the Pittsburgh branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, and also has past bank board experience.
TriState Capital will surely benefit from her experience and counsel.
We are highly motivated by the opportunities we see ahead and encouraged by the performance we're building. In
2020, we focus on the following goals: growing total revenue at a double-digit pace over 2019, growing pre-tax
income at a double-digit pace, growing loans at a double-digit pace of 15% to 25% growing total deposits at a
double-digit pace of 15% to 25%. Growing Chartwell gross client inflows by 25% or more from 2019's $1.1 billion,
improving Chartwell's adjusted EBITDA margin by at least 400 basis points from last year's 21%, excluding
acquisition related expenses, maintaining Chartwell's strong investment performance relative to benchmarks and
maintaining strong asset quality metrics. These 2020 goals are based totally on organic growth and do not take
into account the contributions of any investment management acquisition we may undertake.
Based on our pipeline position in each of the markets we serve, the talent and an infrastructure we have in place
today and our continued focus on responsible investments and expense discipline, TriState Capital is very well-
positioned for strong and profitable growth in 2020 and beyond.

Operator, that concludes my remarks, would you please open the lines?
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please limit yourself to
one question and one follow-up. If you have further questions, you may reenter the question queue. The first
question comes from Michael Perito of KBW. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, good morning guys. Happy New Year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Good morning, Michael. Happy New Year to you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So a couple questions. One, just on the loan growth expectations for 2020 and deposits as well, 15% to 25%,
obviously a fairly wide range, I know historically, you've always said the way to kind of think about is a [ph] 15%
(00:17:53) CAGR, but it would seem like recent performance would at least make us think that we'll have to
rethink that a little bit near-term. And I was just wondering, if you could discuss kind of where the pipelines are,
and maybe what some of the things that will occur in 2020 if you to be at either end of that range that you
provided 25% versus the 15% when thinking about loan and deposit growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Mike, we wanted to provide you with a reasonable guideline based on our assessment of the marketplace. We
obviously had an extraordinary quarter in the fourth quarter. I wish I could say we're – we could guarantee or we
could replicate that on a consistent basis. As you're probably aware, the second and fourth quarter are normally
our strongest quarters, if you look at our business in general. And so what we wanted to do is to give a broad
spectrum. I would tell you everyone sitting around the table here with me would be disappointed if we had 15%
growth in these particular markets.
So, I would say from a longer term forecast, I would fully expect next year that we'd be seeing over 60% of this
loan portfolio being in the private banking category. And I believe that you'll continue to see the commercial real
estate grow, but it'll stay in the range of 30% or maybe slightly less than that. And the rest will be the commercial
and industrial loans. So, we expect that we're going to have a very strong year, as we look at our middle market
place. We see the companies with fairly strong cash – cash flow and we see their inventories relatively low and as
we look at private banking, we've really broaden our distribution network and we are into a lot more opportunities
at this point and we see that continuing to grow at the pace of the 25% to 30% range.

That's very helpful Jim, thank you. And then just secondly, if I just wanted to confirm and ask a follow-up on
CECL, so, if I heard you correctly Jim, so you will no longer be carrying a reserve against the private banking
loans under – once you adapt CECL, is that correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Mike, there is no requirement to it, as you know, we've talked about the regulatory requirements under Basel III.
And Jim mentioned ALLL methodology is the current methodology. Under CECL there is a provision called the
practical expedient, which also applies to these types of loans. So we are not required to carry any capital against
those loans. However, we do put 60 basis points against those loans just out of [ph] under precaution (00:21:06).
So there will be...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So, even once you adopt you CECL you guys and I know there is a loss ratio and collateralize and I don't think
the reserve is all of that significant of the number today, but yield still be pretty something against these loans
even if it's modest amount, even though you don't have to once you adopt CECL?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Exactly, yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: The next question is from Steve Moss of B. Riley. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, B. Riley FBR, Inc.
I just wanted to start on acquisition front, what do you think, Jim the potential for clean acquisitions this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
I communicated to you last year that I've felt very strongly, we could get a – get one done in 2019. I feel just
strong. We're disappointed that what we had worked on did not come to fruition. And Tim Riddle, who is the CEO
of our money management firm and I spent a consequential amount on it. We obviously also spent a meaningful
amount of money on it. But at the end, we've recognized that it – that particular situation would not work for us
and walked away. I would tell you Steve that the market, there is an awful lot of properties on the market at this
particular time. We've been looking at multiple ones and we have a couple that we're looking at very closely right
now. So, the opportunities are there, it's just a question of finding the right opportunity. So, I'm optimistic, but also
disappointed that we won't be able to complete the acquisition that we've looked at, but we walked away for the
right reasons.

Okay. That's helpful. And then my follow-up here is just on capital. Obviously, still plenty of capital to support
growth, but given the growth in the acquisition dynamic, just kind of wondering what are your thoughts are in
potential needs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Steve, good morning. We have the necessary liquidity in capital to pull off an acquisition without needing to go to
the capital markets. So, there's no imminent need to do so, but we'll continue to monitor closely as we move
through the year and as we – as the acquisition targets present themselves.

Want to focus on the outlook for operating expenses and the growth behind that. Perhaps you gave us some
guidance on that in the prepared remarks, I just missed it. But just give us some commentary about your
expectations for expense growth in 2020?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Sure, Matt. You didn't miss it. We didn't provide guidance, I don't believe, but we're going to continue to make the
necessary investments as we always have and people, process in technology to drive growth in the business.
We're very focused on driving operating leverage growth year-over-year. As we sit here today, I'll tell you that the
bank efficiency ratio will probably come in somewhere around 53% to 55% for 2020. We're going to work hard to
come in under that range, but that's our most likely scenario at this point.

Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, I'm curious about your expectation on the loan yields in the
near term and I'm looking for just a general update on pricing that you're seeing through your various major
products, private banking, CRE and C&I and obviously trying to appreciate if the Fed kind of stays put here kind of
what type of inflection we're going to see on the loan yield side? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
So loan pricing assuming no Fed changes this year, so a stable market. We're protecting the commercial and
industrial loans will priced at LIBOR plus 2.25% to 2.50% over LIBOR; CRE, commercial real estate will price at
LIBOR plus 2.35% to 2.75% and private banking will be LIBOR plus 1.75% to 2.50%.

Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
I wanted a quick follow-up on the expense question just asked and David, I appreciate the comment in the bank
efficiency, I wonder though if you could comment you've also started off this from an average asset perspective as
well as the core expense growth percentage perspective. And was hopefully you could share your related
thoughts on those metrics as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah. So, Russell, we don't, as you know, we've talked about it. We don't really focus on expense to average
assets. That's somewhere between 1.60% and 2% depending upon the quarter and the year. We are focused on
driving operating leverage. We couldn't go out there last year to keep the expense growth at 10% or less. We
almost did it. We would have that had we not had the acquisition related expenses – one-time expenses. And so,
we're targeting something around 10% or slightly below that again this year. And that's – I think we've got a
reasonable chance of hitting that.

Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
All right. Appreciate it, David. And then for my second question, guys, thanks for the color on expectations for
where loan yields are expected to re-price. I would be interested in your thoughts around the liability side of the
balance sheet as well – continued traction within the treasury management deposit product and your ability to
lower deals or our cost of funds.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah. I think Russell, to give you the right perspective on it, I think we would give you some colors, we see it on
the quarter that we just came out of, because we could not be more pleased of how this company responded, and
what I would consider somewhat of a challenged environment with the loan portfolio that's well-positioned to avoid
interest rate risk. And what you saw and I think this quarter that we're in right now will be a much more robust
quarter from an earnings standpoint for us as long as the interest rates remain relatively stable.
And what I believe, you saw in the second quarter or the fourth quarter was the real power of our distribution
system. The numbers were truly volume driven and you clearly see the full – you won't see the full impact until the
first quarter is complete. But think of what's reflected here. You had NII of 2% quarter over quarter despite a 10
basis point compression in the NIM. You had continued strong swap fee income. You had lower taxes that were
driven by historical tax credits that were originated by our commercial real estate, bankers who put on loans,
these – the loans that they put on it, put off the historical tax credit so all had, what will be a very strong cash flow.
We had a broad-based world class loan growth. And even if you look at Chartwell, the assets under management
growth outpaced the market places, I noted in the presentation and we were able to sustain the prior quarter's
revenue and improve the bottom line while we had negative cash flows from the Berwyn Income Fund, which is
our highest priced product.
And the growth essentially offset much of the margin compression, and I note that our cost of funds dropped by
37 basis points. And we had robust deposit growth. So, this franchise is now well-established, it's functioning in all
cylinders. And I think this quarter really reflects probably one of the more difficult quarters that we've had in that
regard, and the company continue to grow pretty, handily and showed what its power is, and I think you're going
to see it even more reflected in the quarter that we're in right now.

Russell E. T. Gunther Q

Very good. Jim, David, thank you both.

Operator: The next question is a follow-up from Matt Olney of Stephens. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. Just want to circle back on the whole loan yield discussion David. And if I look at those ranges you gave
me to your various major products, and I apply that to the pricing of your more recent loan mix. I'm showing that
loan yields should be very close to inflecting here and that's assuming LIBOR is unchanged, which is obviously a
important variable. But am I thinking about that right that loan yield should be very close to stabilizing and even
inflecting here over the next quarter or two?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 30-Jan-2020
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah. I think that's right Matt. We don't spend a lot of time talking about NIM. You've heard us and why we don't
do that. But if you just focus on NIM for a second, Jim talked about being able to drive meaningful deposit cost
reduction overall for the year we drove 51 basis points of cost reduction there. And net interest margin for 2019
was 1.97% for the year on average. It was 1.83% on average for the fourth quarter given the backdrop of a flat
Fed environment and then assuming the relationship between LIBOR and EFF continues to hold it 10 to 15 basis
points, we see NIM at about 1.80% this year. So, you're right. We're reaching that point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then more of a modeling question for you, David, I guess obviously the loan growth will
drive the size of the balance sheet, but for securities and for liquidity balances, how should we be thinking about
forecasting this? I think both of those are around 6% of average earning assets. Is that a reasonable expectation
that those should remain each around 6% of average earning asset as you grow the loan book in 2020?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
They will, I would say 6% to 8%. We have been holding cash because we didn't have like the rate environment,
but as we grow this bank, we need to continue to grow on balance sheet liquidity. And so, we've been very
focused on the investment book early this year. We've made some purchases here in the first quarter and you will
see us continue to build that book – the investment book over the course of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Great. That's all for me. Thank you, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: The next question is from Bill Dezellem of Tieton Capital Management. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Dezellem Q
Analyst, Tieton Capital Management
Yeah. Thank you. That's Tieton Capital. But would you please discuss the roughly $9 million jump in the adverse
credits and what led to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James F. Getz A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah. I'll be more than glad to go over that with you, Bill. What – the challenge that we have is our adverse rating
credits are very, very low for a $7.5 billion bank. So anytime you have any type of modification, it'll be a most
noted. But let me point out what drove that and we also should give you a sense of what's going on within the
context of that portfolio. It was essentially two loans, both secured by real estate, one of them is a little over $2
million loan that's secured by real estate and the assignment of an endowment fund. And the other one and these
were both 6 rated credits and now they are 7 rated, there were special mention they are not substandard credits.
And the other one is a real estate loan, $7.3 million and its sole bank deal. We're the only party involved, and it's
secured by real estate. Both these are paying as agreed. I can point out to you that we don't have a single
commercial loan that's not paying as agreed. But I also would like to point out to you that during this quarter,

which you didn't see substandard loans decreased $2.1 million. So our substandard loans are now $4.9 million.
Our non-performing loans remained at just $188 – $183,000. OREO remained exactly the same, no change and
our non-performing assets were not changed for the quarter either.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Dezellem Q
Analyst, Tieton Capital Management
Great. Thank you. And then do we understand correctly that under CECL and the provision will move up to
something in the neighborhood of $1.25 million per quarter versus your $750,000 this quarter, so essentially a
rounding there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Bill, yeah. So what Jim mentioned is $4.5 million to $5.5 million of provision this year under CECL is what we're
thinking at the moment that's our best – best view of how the year will play out and it's obviously going to change
as the loans build over the course of the quarter and as we continue to move through the year. But that's our
estimate at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: The next question is a follow-up from Russell Gunther of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Yeah, thanks guys, for the follow-up on the CECL front as well. Do you guys have an estimated Day 1 impact that
we'll see in the first quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Demas A
Chief Financial Officer, TriState Capital Holdings, Inc.
Yeah, Russell we're still fine tuning some of the data and running some back tests. And so we're not going to put
out a number just yet, but it's going to be very modest relative to capital. It will not be – we're not anticipating it'll
be a material impact.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay great. That was it for me. Thanks David.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
