Q4 2023 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2024
Let's turn to the slides turning first to slide 3. Over the last 15 years, we have transformed the Firm's business
mix, scale, profitability and returns. If you compare various historical periods, you can see our business evolution.
Each period faced its own challenges. In 2009 to 2014, Morgan Stanley was a classic self-help story,
transformation began with the acquisition and integration of Smith Barney. The Investment Bank was reset and
the Firm survived the near triple credit downgrade and the euro crisis.
In 2015 to 2019, we weathered the years of financial repression, resizing our Fixed Income business and pressing
ahead to the top slot in institutional equities. During this period, we also acquired Solium, which was a step toward
leadership in the corporate stock plan space. Then in 2020 to 2022, the COVID years, we achieved incremental
scale in both Wealth and Investment Management with the acquisitions of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance, giving us
a leading self-directed platform and pushing forward in investment solutions. During this period, each of the two
major business lines, Wealth and Investment Management and Institutional Securities, generated operating
leverage and high returns.
Transformed Morgan Stanley today has tripled client assets in its durable businesses with significant opportunities
for further growth. Notwithstanding 2023's geopolitical, macroeconomic and industry challenges, the Firm's
business model generated consistent results. In 2023, Firm revenues were $54 billion with $12 billion of PBT,
double the averages of 2009 to 2014. Our return on tangible common equity was a solid 13%, inclusive of notable
items that reduced returns by over 100 basis points.
Last year's return profile was triple the post crisis years. Combined earnings from Wealth and Investment
Management generated 60% of the Firm's top line and PBT, and our Category of One asset gathering strategies
set the stage for continued durable growth. The Institutional Securities business also grew over the transformation
years with an eye to investing in its leading franchises. The objective has been to create an integrated investment
bank of Investment Banking, Equities and Fixed Income to serve leading institutions around the world. Taken
together, the Morgan Stanley business portfolio of today has well higher and more stable profitability. The actions
we've taken over the last 15 years, organic and inorganic, were all within our core strategic footprint. At its center
is acting as a trusted advisor to clients, helping them raise, allocate and manage capital. It is what we do. We are
a global leader, and we are really good at it. This will not change.
Turning to slide 4. In 2010, revenues in Wealth and Investment Management have more than doubled, and today,
we're number one in the world among our peers. During the same period, our client assets have more than tripled
to $6.6 trillion. We see continued opportunity to drive growth and are steadfast in our goal of reaching $10 trillion
in total client assets.
In Wealth Management, we've established ourselves as a leading asset gatherer by expanding our business
model across three channels: advisor-led, self-directed and workplace. The business generated $1 trillion of net
new assets over the past three years, and we are relentlessly focused on sustainable growth. We expect NNA
growth to continue to vary quarter-by-quarter given seasonality and even year-to-year given market tone and the
cadence of migrating workplace assets and attracting assets held away. We are nevertheless confident in our
ability to continue to grow and deepen our 18 million relationships with the breadth of our Wealth Management
offering.
Over time, our ability to attract, deepen and retain client relationships with our differentiated platform allows us to
drive revenue growth and operating leverage, enabling 30% margins. Given some of the recent macro headwinds
and our continued investments for growth, it's reasonable to expect reported margins to consolidate in the mid-

20s range over the near term. The underlying business has achieved 30% margins before and we intend to
deliver that return profile again in the long term against a higher base of revenue.
Our Wealth platform is complemented by Investment Management, where we've added a number of new
capabilities to our strong public market alpha engines. This business is well aligned to key areas where we see
secular growth including customization, such as Parametric, private markets and value-add credit. At a holistic
level, the Wealth and Investment Management business has achieved the kind of scale which enables us to
invest in what matters most to clients and to take further market share through cycles.
Turning to slide 5. Morgan Stanley's Institutional Securities Group, our integrated investment bank, is a
preeminent global franchise. Our capability set, extensive client footprint and premier brand put us in a position to
be the trusted advisor to every important corporation, public or private, asset manager and asset owner. Our
teams across geographies, businesses and client segments position us at the center of global capital allocation
and formation. Over the last decade, we've advised on nearly $9 trillion in M&A transactions, raised nearly $13
trillion of capital for clients and as indication of our markets presence, in a single trading session last month, our
Equities business transacted roughly $250 billion of notional value. Our leadership position outside the US, acting
as a true global investment bank, is critical to the Morgan Stanley franchise.
After more than five years managing our integrated investment bank, I would add that it is clear from client visits
around the world that the barriers to entry to becoming a global investment bank are real. Today, there are fewer
competitors and we are one of those very few who can provide the full breadth of capabilities. We expect the next
economic and financial cycle to be led by corporate finance activity, which will drive Investment Banking growth
and as such, are particularly focused on expanding our 15% wallet share in that advice-driven business.
Turning to slide 6. When you combine our Wealth and Investment Management platform with our leading
institutional franchise, you see the power of what we will call the Integrated Firm. Our capacity to source new
client opportunities, efficiently facilitate the flow of capital and deliver Morgan Stanley Firm-wide solutions has
never been stronger.
Looking at the right side of the slide, more specifically, our premier corporate franchise spans every business
segment, with clients at the center of everything we do. We cover their broad range of needs from advising the C-
suite on strategy, to helping them raise capital and hedge risks, on through to advising the broader employee
base through our workplace offering.
Second, we have a unique capability to serve individuals who range from self-directed up through to the ultra-high
net worth set and small institutions who sit between the traditional segments. We can deliver best-in-class
institutional capabilities, paired with sophisticated wealth management solutions in an integrated service model.
Third, we continue to invest in our ability to deliver investment and client solutions as we are at the center of
financial innovation and growth. Our global integrated investment bank is core to our ability to source and
structure customized opportunities for corporations and financial sponsors. Our structuring capabilities are
augmented by scaled distribution channels, extending from the largest institutions through the individual retail
client set. With a central focus on our clients, we see significant opportunities in delivering the Integrated Firm.
Turning to slide 7. Ultimately, the Firm's success relies on our human capital and maintaining a differentiated
partnership culture. With James as Executive Chairman and together with Andy Saperstein and Dan Simkowitz as
our Co-Presidents, our highest priority is delivering the Integrated Firm to our clients. Our shared Morgan Stanley
experience, having all lived through the 15-year transformation, gives us a lens into where we come from and

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2024
where we are going. Intentional mobility of our leadership, engineered by James over these many years, is
particularly important. Andy in his expanded role, as Head of both Wealth and Investment Management, is well
situated to leverage the deep knowledge of retail distribution and products to drive client opportunities across the
business.
Dan, having successfully revitalized Investment Management for nearly a decade, is returning to lead Institutional
Securities, where he spent 25 years. He'll play a critical role in connecting the Firm around sourcing opportunities,
structuring financing and distributing capital for our clients. Both these gentlemen have burnished the brand and
successfully integrated acquisitions. To have James, Dan and Andy as partners to open 2024 speaks to the
enduring strength of our culture.
Our broader leadership team has worked together since the financial crisis through the strategic transformation
and today are unified in advancing toward our goals. The operating and management committees of the Firm
each have an average tenure of more than 20 years. Long tenure is one element that maintains the strength of a
learning culture of serving clients in a first-class way.
In addition to backing the Morgan Stanley experience set of our long-standing leaders, we're enhanced by the
injection of some key lateral hires and joiners via our acquisitions. Our businesses are supported by a world-class
technology and infrastructure organization and by 2,320 talented Managing Directors, 155 of whom we promoted
with a partnership last week. Our 80,000 people are what makes Morgan Stanley's culture and drives us to be
excellent on behalf of our clients, to be prudent fiduciaries of capital and to maintain a keen awareness of the road
we have traveled to achieve the Firm we have today.
Turning to slide 8. In addition to, one, the performance of the business; two, driving the Integrated Firm and;
three, maintaining our culture; we are, four, highly focused on the state of our financial capital. Given our
deliberate growth and durable earnings over the last several years, our capital position is strong going to the
finalization of Basel III endgame. Our regulatory requirements, as measured within our Stress Capital Buffer, have
steadily come down since 2020, reflecting the improved resilience of our businesses.
With respect to Basel III endgame, we continue to believe after fulsome industry comment and further valuation of
economic and competitive impacts that the final rule will result in a well, more constructive outcome than originally
proposed, particularly as it pertains to matters that are driving our estimated RWA inflation.
Looking ahead, we remain committed to the dividend, as is it at the core of our business model's durability. While
we will toggle among opportunities to support our clients, grow our businesses and repurchase our stock, the core
strengths and strategic decisions of the last 15 years are reflected in our quarterly dividend, which we've grown
from $0.05 to $0.85 per share. The continued sustainability of that dividend is paramount.
With the Firm coming together, we will drive toward our performance goals. Slide 9 reiterates our confidence in
them. Our strategy and long-term value proposition remain intact. The four Firm-wide goals are in place: hitting
$10 trillion in client assets; achieving a 30% Wealth Management pre-tax margin; [ph] we have (00:13:29) 70%
Firm-wide efficiency ratio; and achieving 20% returns on tangible equity. Our management team is steeled to
execute against our priorities to reach these goals.
We enter 2024 with confidence, and our base case for the coming year is constructive. There are two major
downside risks. The first is geopolitical, that global conflicts intensify and conflagrate. The second is the state of
the US economy over the course of 2024. The base case is benign, namely that of a soft landing. But if the

economy weakens dramatically in the quarters to come and the Fed has to move rapidly to avoid a hard landing,
that would likely result in lower asset prices and activity levels.
On the other hand, if inflation in fact [ph] has (00:14:15) not been beaten back and continues to challenge
consumers and the supply chain, that could result in a stickier Fed and the resulting higher-for-longer will have to
absorbed in the way of a higher-than-expected cost of capital and the dangers of a bifurcated economy. These
risks, the geopolitical and that of the US economy, presents some uncertainties as we start 2024.
Nevertheless, as we have discussed this morning, the Morgan Stanley of today is meant to perform through the
cycle, and based on the evidence we see, our building M&A and IPO pipelines, improving boardroom confidence
and an increasingly positive tone from our retail and institutional clients, we remain constructive on the year
ahead.
We will execute on our clear and consistent strategy. We have a global business, a world-class wealth and
investment manager alongside a leading investment bank. The growth opportunities are extraordinary, especially
given how our businesses and regions intersect and support the business strategy. We will continue to lead with
asset consolidation across Wealth and Investment Management and remain committed to growing high-quality
share in Institutional Securities to consistently deliver our Integrated Firm to clients around the world. In so doing,
we will continue to execute towards our key objectives and to deliver for shareholders.
I will now turn the call over to Sharon, who will discuss our fourth quarter and annual results, and then together,
we'll take your questions. Thank you.

Thank you, and good morning. The Firm produced revenues of $54.1 billion in 2023 and ended the year with
fourth quarter revenues of $12.9 billion. For the full year, ROTCE was 12.8% and EPS was $5.18. And for the
fourth quarter, ROTCE was 8.4% and EPS was $0.85. The full year efficiency ratio was 77.2%. A number of
factors impacted our annual and quarterly results.
The full year results include nearly $900 million of notable items. Over half of these items were reflected in the
fourth quarter. A $286 million FDIC special assessment charge and a legal settlement of $249 million were both
realized in the fourth quarter. In addition, the full year results include $353 million of severance expenses,
primarily related to a May employee action. The combination of these three items negatively impacted full year
EPS by $0.44, ROTCE by 105 basis points and the efficiency ratio by 164 basis points.
Total integration-related expenses for the year were $293 million, nearly 70% of which was related to E*TRADE.
With the E*TRADE integration now complete, we remain focused on continuing to manage our expense base,
supporting our long-term efficiency goals while still investing in growth.
Now, to the businesses. Institutional Securities' full year revenues were $23.1 billion and quarterly revenues were
$4.9 billion. Full year results were impacted by the weak investment banking environment that began with the
onset of the hiking cycle, and geopolitical events in early 2022 and persisted through most of the past year.
Fourth quarter revenues reflected stronger Investment Banking results and prudent risk management across
Fixed Income and Equities. Investment Banking revenues were $4.6 billion for the full year. Lower completed
M&A transactions followed a dearth of announcements in the back half of 2022 and early 2023 which weighed on

results. However, optimism began to rise midyear, followed by a notable increase in Morgan Stanley's announced
volumes starting in the third quarter and continuing into the fourth quarter.
Fourth quarter revenues were $1.3 billion. Results were supported mostly by fixed income underwriting, as the
investment grade market remained open for regular way issuance and was supported by event-driven activity.
Advisory revenues have begun to recover versus recent quarters, and were roughly flat year-over-year. Equity
underwriting revenues were also flat, as activity remained muted.
As we enter 2024, we are positioned to capitalize on the opportunity set. While downside risks are linked to the
consumer with the rate path and geopolitics as two key determinants, we expect the US will lead the recovery
globally. Corporate confidence will ultimately drive the cycle forward and we are encouraged by signs that the
CEO and boardroom optimism is growing, evidenced by the build of our advisory and IPO pipelines.
Our integrated investment bank is well positioned to capitalize on the recovering backdrop, particularly where the
institution works across the businesses with CEOs, CFOs and treasurers on corporate solutions. Strength in
sentiment should support broad M&A and new capital market issuance and eventually feed through to the broader
market activity.
Equity full year revenues were $10 billion, reflecting lower revenues across regions. Tempered client engagement
was reflective of broad market uncertainty. Revenues were $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter. Prime brokerage
revenues in the fourth quarter were solid. Results reflected narrower spreads and the geographic mix of client
balances.
Cash results declined versus last year's fourth quarter, reflecting lower volume, particularly in Asia ex-Japan.
Derivative results were up versus last year's fourth quarter, as the business continue to grow the client base.
Fixed Income revenues were $7.7 billion for the full year, declining from 2022's strong result. The full year decline
was driven by lower client activity in foreign exchange and commodities, which were impacted by greater
uncertainty around the rate outlook and less volatile energy markets.
Quarterly revenues were $1.4 billion. Macro performance was down versus the prior fourth quarter. Results
reflected fewer monetization opportunities, particularly in Asia compared to heightened engagement in the region
last year. Micro was down year-over-year, driven by lower revenues in credit corporates, which was negatively
impacted by movements in credit spreads on the back of geopolitical events. Results in commodities were up
versus last year's fourth quarter, primarily reflecting improved performance in the power and gas business.
Turning to Wealth Management. For the full year, Wealth Management's revenues were $26.3 billion and the pre-
tax profit was $6.5 billion, which resulted in a PBT margin of 24.9%. Reported results reflect the complex macro
backdrop, as well as several idiosyncratic events. The unprecedented rise in the absolute level of interest rates
were particularly consequential, as the subsequent shifts in client behavior impacted the revenue mix and margin.
In addition, there were several expense items that impacted the margin, including integration-related expenses,
the FDIC special assessment, severance charges, and the impact of DCP, which saw meaningful swings
compared to last year. Taken together, these four items impacted the full year margin by over 250 basis points.
Total client assets ended the year at a new high, reaching $5.1 trillion of assets. Full year fee-based flows were
$109 billion. These flows and associated fees offset the market levels and changes in interest mix of client
portfolios, supporting the year-over-year increase in Asset Management revenues. Fourth quarter revenues were
$6.6 billion and the reported PBT margin was 21.5%. The aforementioned notable expenses negatively impacted
the fourth quarter margin by over 400 basis points.

Asset Management revenues in the quarter were $3.6 billion, up approximately $200 million from the prior year's
fourth quarter. Quarterly fee-based flows were strong at $42 billion, underscoring the value clients are seeing in
our advice-based model. Client allocations to higher yielding cash alternatives remained elevated, and clients
continued to deploy monthly inflows into equity markets from suite balances.
The eventual return of the new issuance calendar and improved retail sentiment should provide a tailwind, as
clients look to redeploy into broader asset classes. Net new assets of $282 billion for the year represented 7%
annual growth rate of beginning-period assets. Fourth quarter net new assets were $47 billion. For the full year,
net new asset growth was driven by the advisor-led channel, across existing clients, new clients and net
recruiting.
Transactional revenues in the fourth quarter were $1.1 billion. Excluding the impact of DCP, transactional
revenues increased slightly year-over-year, as clients invested in Structured Products and Fixed Income products.
Bank lending balances of $147 billion remained roughly flat, consistent with the environment. Total deposit
increased 2% quarter-over-quarter to $346 billion, driven by continued demand for our savings offering from our
Wealth Management channel and a modest increase in suite balances.
Net interest income was $1.9 billion in the quarter. The sequential decrease was primarily driven by the mix of
average deposits and the blended deposit cost in the quarter. Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2024, the
deposit mix will continue to be the primary driver of net interest income. The modest sequential build in sweeps
was promising and suggests we are nearing a level of frictional sweeps and client accounts. Assuming that the
forward curve holds and that our assumptions around client behavior materialize, we would expect NII in the first
quarter to be roughly in line with the fourth quarter.
Our asset-led gathering strategy remains unchanged, and we expect it to deliver margin expansion over time. The
path is clear and includes the following objectives. First, increase relationships through our channel; second,
migrate assets to advice; third, deepen existing client relationships with enhanced capabilities including new
products and solutions; and finally, realize scale benefits of our investments over time. These efforts are well
underway.
In the year, we grew client relationships by over 600,000 across the franchise. This was led by success in the
workplace channel, as we continue to win corporate plans and add participants in stock plans. In the prior three
years, we saw an average of $50 billion of workplace assets migrate to the advisor-led channel on an annual
basis. This year, client migration was up 25% year-over-year despite economic headwinds.
And on the products side, our financial advisors are offering clients investment opportunities such as private
credit, private equity and all the other alternatives. Bringing Wealth and Investment Management closer together
will create greater opportunities for ongoing product creation. As we move forward and transition from integration
to optimization for client experience, we expect to see greater scale benefits from our investments over time.
Investment Management reported full year results of $5.4 billion and fourth quarter revenues of $1.5 billion. AUM
increased year-over-year to $1.5 trillion, supported by higher asset values. Long-term net outflows of
approximately $7 billion were driven by headwinds in our MSIM active equity growth strategies.
Within Alternatives and Solutions, we continue to see demand for Parametric customized portfolios across both
Equity and Fixed Income strategies, as more retail clients seek customized solutions. Liquidity/Overlay Services
had outflows of $6.6 billion. Weaker institutional liquidity flows were partially offset by demand for Parametric's

Overlay product, and the combined Parametric brand inclusive of Overlay and its retail offering had net inflows of
over $5 billion again this quarter, underscoring the strength of our differentiated, customized offering.
Fourth quarter Asset Management and related fees of $1.4 billion increased slightly versus last year. Quarterly
performance-based income and other revenues were $61 million. Gains in US private equity and infrastructure
offset losses in real estate, reflecting the benefits of diversification in the franchise.
Turning to the balance sheet. Total spot assets were $1.2 trillion. Standardized RWAs increased by $13 billion
sequentially to $457 billion, as we actively supported clients. We prudently managed our capital profile and ended
the year with a standardized CET1 ratio of 15.2%, while focusing on our strategic priorities including our
commitment to return capital to our shareholders. Utilizing the flexibility of our repurchase authorization, we were
opportunistic at the start of the fourth quarter and we bought back $1.3 billion of common stock.
The full year tax rate was 21.9%, reflecting the realization of certain tax benefits earlier in the year. The fourth
quarter's tax rate was 26.5%, primarily reflecting the tax implications of a specific legal matter. We expect the
2024 tax rate to be approximately 23%. Consistent with prior years, we continue to expect some quarterly
volatility.
A number of idiosyncratic and macro headwinds added complexity to the backdrop over the last year.
Notwithstanding these challenges, we ended the year better than where we started. We now have $6.6 trillion of
client assets, and we successfully completed our E*TRADE integration. As it relates to capital markets,
boardroom confidence is rising and our calendar is building. We approach 2024 with optimism, keenly aware of
the dynamic environment we operate in, as we continue to drive towards our performance goals.
With that, we will now open the line up to questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We are now ready to take in questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Dan
Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is now open, please go ahead. Oops, it looks like we've lost Dan. We'll move to
Glenn Schorr with Evercore.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thanks very much. So, Sharon, I love how you've laid out the picture on the Wealth Management margin
potential, so my – and I do like that sweeps have settled in. So, I'm curious in the big picture, has FA and client
behavior changed a bunch on the cash management front such that that's a potential driver of margin potential
and why you're leaning towards that mid-20s near term versus the 30% where we were kind of hanging out when
rates were lower and deposits were higher. Is that the primary driver of the margin thought, and do you think
behavior's changed like permanently?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
So, I can't speak to behavior permanently, but I appreciate the question, Glenn. If we take a step back, it was
always a idea on the premise of a sustainable growth in margin was really about ensuring that we continue to see
growth in fee-based assets and we see growth in that migration towards the advice-based channel. And in fact,
that is what you've begun to see. Look at our fee-based flows this quarter alone and think about the fee-based
flows that we've had over the course of the year. We continue to educate our clients. So, when we think through
the funnel, we have more participants, we begin to see more assets, and then those assets will over time migrate
to advice.
What you point out as we think about the cash and what some might call cash sorting, et cetera, is that we still
have that 22%, 23% sitting in cash equivalents, so not necessarily BDP, but rather cash equivalents that don't
necessarily earn a fee, right? Money markets, think of a savings product over time, et cetera, that you might see.
As individuals begin to take that money and deploy it into markets or deploy it into fee-based, that will be accretive
to the margin over time. And that, to your point, is a place where you should begin to see a margin build and
something that becomes more sustainable as we both grow our asset base and grow the advice and the client
migration towards advice in those fee-based assets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Makes sense. I appreciate that. Maybe just a follow-up in Wealth, if I could. It certainly doesn't show in your flows
this quarter, so I guess I know where you're going to go with this, but you're just definitely hearing a lot more from
the bank-owned wealth management companies that are turning up the heat a little bit on recruiting and a lot
more on their intent to better penetrate their banking clients' wallet. So, I'm curious if you feel any of that in your
franchise, any of that where you compete, and whether or not that impacts your thought process on your ability to
attract some of the trillions of dollars held away that is always part of the grow story.

So, the first point I'd say is it's obviously always a competitive market, but we're very well positioned given the
tools that we've given to our advisors. A couple of points that I would make to you. The first is, when we look
forward into the first quarter, that recruiting pipeline is healthy. So, when we think about January and what we're
seeing, we see the recruiting being healthy.
The second point that I'd mention is what I find to be most encouraging when you look under the NNA data is that
we're seeing new clients come to Morgan Stanley. So, it's not just attracting assets held away, but rather you're
actually getting new clients from those participants, and then you're seeing conversion. So, when you think about
some of the statistics that I gave you around workplace, and we talked about these statistics, the workplace
assets that move over, you have 80% of those assets are actually assets that are coming from outside the
institution. So, you're bringing new clients in, and then they're bringing their assets that are sitting away into the
institution. So, I think we're well positioned to capture those opportunities.
Final point that I'd make is on your banking product, actually, this idea of the E*TRADE integration, right? And we
talked about we've completed the integration, and I said we're looking towards the forward or the front office
integration. Some of that will be around banking products, et cetera, as we think and we look ahead over a
multiyear journey.

Thanks. Good morning. Congrats on the new role, Ted. I was hoping you could elaborate on the current
environment a little bit more and maybe what you see as the biggest opportunities for growth as you look to make
progress against the longer-term targets that you've outlined.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward N. Pick A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Morgan Stanley
Thanks for your question. I think we, as you heard from my comments, are generally constructive about what
2024 brings, and it should be beneficial to both arms of the Firm. Some of the reorientation of cash equivalents,
whether they be in money markets or treasuries and the like that Sharon referred to, and redeployed by our
Wealth clients into the markets [ph] by giving (00:36:43) increasing sense of stability, clearly good for FAs and for
the Wealth channel.
In the Investment Bank, we've had a decades-long [ph] drought (00:36:55) in IPOs, the slowest volume we've
seen in decades. And as you know, we've had a very light M&A calendar, so that also has been in a trough. Sort
of early cycle type activity from our highest margin products inside of the Investment Bank, but specifically inside
of Investment Banking, we think inure to our benefit, too. So, we quite possibly could have a dynamic where if we
are in this soft landing zone, we could see increased activity. Ultimately, we are in the tickets business, activity-
based in both channels and benign economic conditions augur well for both Wealth and Investment, but also for
the Investment Bank.
And part of the reason I want to talk about the Integrated Firm today was because the two segments working
together will bring, inevitably, additional growth opportunities inside the Firm. We have folks that have mobilized
around the enterprise and are now in a position to talk to clients across the product spectrum and to bring in
additional business.

We have a big business, as you know, in Europe and in Asia. So, if economic conditions are better than the
expected, which is that Europe will struggle and China might as well, if we do any better than that, we would
expect to see some increased activity coming out of those regions, too. So, it's not just a US proposition, but a
global one as well.

Daniel T. Fannon Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great. Thank you. And you mentioned margins within the Wealth channel – or Wealth segment will consolidate
around the mid-20s here in the near term. Can you maybe unpack some of the inputs that will drive that outcome?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Certainly. I worked through that, I think, Dan, when I actually tried to explain it in the script. So, the premise in
terms of the growing Wealth Management margin, again, is about the conversion to the advice-based model over
time. Of course, individuals will have the different pieces, right, but we have three different channels that we've
talked about. We've talked about self-directed, we've talked about workplace, we've talked about advice. On the
self-directed side, we will continue to attract those clients, and those that might be interested in advice will see it
as we have different ways to give people a sense and a connection to FAs. So, we've talked about that.
On the workplace side, we continue to get new participants, new corporate relationships and that, as we educate
people with the wellness offering, et cetera, and we've seen evidence of this, to bring people yet again to that
advice-driven model. And the fee-based flows, as you see those, those will help us grow the asset management
line.
Then, you can break it down again. The transactional line, we've talked about. You're going to have new products
and you're going to have a deployment of this cash that's been sitting on the sidelines that we've talked a lot
about, the dry powder, that could impact either the transactional line or the asset management line. And again,
we're encouraged by the signs that we're seeing in NII. That too suggests that we are seeing – as of right now, it
looks like that cash, that frictional level of cash, is stabilizing.
[ph] Then you have (00:40:15) the drivers in each of those lines as we think about the revenue side. And then as
you think about the expense side, those – we are looking for places to invest and gain from the scale of those
investments. And that will be, as part of the objectives that Ted laid out when you see $10 trillion of assets.

Thanks. Good morning, and welcome, Ted. Maybe just going back to the strategic update, going to slide 13
where you sort of lay out very nicely the transformation over the last 15 years. As we look forward over the next
three to five years, I was wondering if you can help fill in the blanks around – strategically, M&A has been a key
pillar of this transformation. As we think about both organic and inorganic, one, on the M&A side, give us a sense
of just where you see deal-making happening over the next few years. We saw a big private asset deal being
announced on Friday, and so would love some perspective there.

Edward N. Pick A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Morgan Stanley
We believe that the revenue mix will toggle around. There could be periods like in 2020 or 2021 where the
Investment Bank is really firing on all cylinders, again early economy type of activity, and that could grow again
towards 50%. And we could have other periods where as we continue to invest in the Wealth and Investment
Management piece of the Firm, that could expand further.
I think where we are right now is a revenue and profitability matter where 60% of the Firm is in Wealth and
Investment Management, is not a bad place to start. I think the main message I'd want to convey today is that
while there's a change in leadership after 14 years of James' stewardship, there's not a change in strategy.
We have undertaken and integrated – if you really go back into time and then include Mesa West, five different
acquisitions, and I think the view inside the house is that's good for now. We can execute our business with the
growth plans in front of us, and it feels organic. Now, that having been said, there are ideas that come across the
transom, and we naturally would take a look. But I think for the next period, the view that I would have is that we
really work to grow the organization and to do so organically and efficiently.
I think on the margin, one comment might be that we could work on sweating the income statement a bit more.
There is little more work to be done, post-integration, where there could be inefficiencies [ph] along (00:43:35) the
income statement, and I think we are much focused on looking for those efficiencies without giving up any of the
strategic investment that we want to make on our way to 30% PBT margins in Wealth and 70% efficiency of the
Firm.
The way I've articulated the strategic goals is to effectively reiterate we will achieve those goals, but along the
way, we will invest, and that investment opportunity exists on the current portfolio in an exciting way. And that is
why for me the most important message we want to send out to folks today was this concept of the Integrated
Firm.
Now we have the portfolio of businesses together. We have a unified partnership culture. We have the two halves
of the Firm, it'll toggle by 5 or 10 points on revenue or profitability given a period of time, and now we can scale
that organically and hit the numbers and work the income statement a little bit.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Hi, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
So, want – hey. Wanted to start off, Ted and Sharon, with just a question on incremental margins and comp
leverage in a lower rate backdrop. We know NII is going to be a source of drag in the coming quarters, certainly if
the forward curve manifests, but fees should see improved momentum from equity market tailwinds, stronger fee-
based flows, a better IB backdrop. But the Street is modeling comp dollars flat, revenues up about $2 billion. I'm
just trying to get a sense as to how we should think about incremental margins as revenue momentum improves,
but the growth is coming admittedly from more compensable areas.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
So, you obviously did hit the nail on the head in terms of the different pieces, right? So, you can't look at the
different line items the same way. You're going to have a comp ratio change as FAs get compensated, as you
would expect, on the grid associated with those fee-based revenues. As it relates to NII, yes, that was non-
compensable. As I just told you the expectation on a quarter-over-quarter basis, if client behavior remains
unchanged, you are sitting in a position where you're beginning to better understand what that behavior is and
that NII will be roughly in line with where it was in the fourth quarter at least for the first quarter. So, yes, the comp
itself might change. But the actual growth in the ability to see the fee-based assets grow is higher.
There are also other offsetting factors that we have to think about as we look back into the last year. Remember
that what I highlighted was you had negative implications associated with mix of revenue in those asset
management lines because of the fact that we saw investors invest in Fixed Income products, you had market
dynamics associated with billing, et cetera. So, there is place – are, rather, places that you can see growth in the
asset management line. Yes, they will be compensable, but we would see benefits of scale both from the asset
side and hopefully from the market side as you see different pieces being invested as you move forward.
I hope that helps to frame the answer to your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Yeah, that's really helpful. And just for my follow-up, I was hoping you could just speak to the sensitivity to lower
rates. It's a big area of focus for investors. You benefit from having the majority of your deposits in premium
savings where admittedly you have a bit of pricing flexibility. At the same time, the asset side is still very sensitive
to the short end. So, wanted to get a sense as to how you expect the NII trajectory to unfold as the Fed begins
easing and whether there's any appetite on your side to extend durations, maybe lock in some higher yields.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2024
It's a great question, and the answer is fully premised on what we see first with deposits, right? So, your sort of
first order condition as you look ahead into 2024 is what happens to the deposit mix. What I said on the call is that
we're encouraged – in my prepared remarks, we're encouraged by what we've seen to-date as of the beginning of
the January. If you were to assume that, that were to hold, the next question is, what is the pace of the interest
rate cuts that we see. If you see an instantaneous shock, we disclosed to you what that means, right? So, an
instantaneous 100 basis point shock lower will be negative, around $600 million, right? However, if it was more
gradual in nature, which is similar to what you might see in a forward curve, you will have offsets associated with
the reinvestment of the portfolio. So, that will offset the rate decline, right? Will largely offset those rate declines,
but it will depend. First order condition is, are deposits stable, is the mix stable, and that's what we've seen so far.
So, let's see if that holds. And then second, what is the pace of the cuts over the course of the year?

Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Yeah, thanks so much, and good morning, Ted and Sharon. Sharon, maybe just to start with a question on
Investment Banking, and good to hear about the tone improvement there. Sponsors have been less active than
corporates at least from the data we track, and we know sponsors have record dry powder, but higher interest
rates, current valuations have been a little bit challenging for them. So, just the question is whether they are in a
position to return in force over the next year. I think that's probably going to be necessary for full normalization in
Investment Banking, and then just what you're seeing when you talk about the pipelines that you have, which are
good, what are sponsors doing in those pipelines? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Sure. Overall, the pipeline is more diversified than we've necessarily seen in historical years. We expect to see
continued momentum in energy that we've seen over the past year. We see optimistic signs in real estate, and we
see optimistic signs in technology.
As it relates to sponsors, we would expect sponsors to come back. That will obviously take time, and I do think it
will likely take a couple of potential prints in certain places. And other things that will be encouraging will be on the
equity IPO side. What I'd say is we moved from a period of time that was window-driven, and that market is
beginning to build momentum. And so, the juxtaposition between the outlook for 2024 I think in 2023 is important
there as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Okay. Terrific. And then a question for Ted. So, I think you're pretty clear here. The strategic trajectory is not
changing dramatically, but we often get the question around stylistically what's changing. And so, you have a
different background than James, and I think everyone has their own management style, and you've run some big
businesses very successfully for Morgan Stanley. So, want to maybe just hit on briefly how you would
characterize kind of your style and just the ability to leverage your experience and what may change as a result of
that. Thanks.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2024
Well, I'd say that's a great question. James and I are much more similar than not. He brings to the table a positive
mojo to the business from the time that he took over as CEO when things were in, as you know, pretty rough
shape. And for now in his 15th year of leadership as Exec Chair, he brings that positive spirit to every single
interaction that we have, whether it's our operating and management committees, our risk meetings, these calls,
client interactions, cultural work with our newbies and folks that are looking to get promoted in the organization, I
think that spirit of positivity is something that has been contagious in the organization. It's something that I'm a big
believer in and has worked well inside of the Trading businesses, inside of Investment Banking, and I think you
can feel it throughout the Firm.
So, the reaffirmation of our partnership, our core values, and this articulation of the Integrated Firm, which is the
next step now, because we went from trying to build our way back to generating the kind of enhanced scale and
deeper moats through these gutsy acquisitions, that brought us to a place now where we can look around and
see how we can bring the Firm closely together.
I think the tone is one of determination. I've been at this place for more than three decades, and we had our
moment sort of before the abyss in 2008, and I think it's fair to say that the entire senior partnership, James, but
also the folks that came to the organization like myself, we are determined to not revisit anything that feels like
those days.
So, the calling card here is durability, is consistency. We want to put up consistent results. Part of what you see in
the strategic deck in the back, on back page, those are very clear numbers, and we will hit them. We'll hit those
numbers. It will take time. We will have to do all of the three yards and a cloud of dust work associated with
thoughtfully working our way to those numbers, such that when we hit them in a normalized environment, which
will be part of the next arrow on page 3 in the years to come, we will have done so in a way where we can
achieve full valuation on it because the view will be that they are not only achieved for a moment in time, but
sustainable. And that obviously is also the calling card of James' tenure which is that of consistency and
durability.
So, if the first is this positive mojo and a second is this ethos of consistency, rigor, durability, I think the third at the
end of the day has been to believe in what Morgan Stanley can aspire to for clients, and that is this Integrated
Firm that we are something differentiated in our two channels, very clear in what we do and what we don't do, and
that the cycle's very much a tailwind for us.

Christian Bolu Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Good morning, Ted, and welcome to the call. Good morning, Sharon, as well.
Maybe, Ted, for you, on the Trading businesses, Morgan Stanley has suffered some share loss over the last
couple of years, and your peers have been aggressively allocating capital to that business and gaining share. So,
maybe curious of how you're thinking about opportunities to grow those businesses and any plans to either invest
more capital or resources into that business.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 16-Jan-2024
Thanks for the question. Christian, good to hear your voice. I think we know that we have – we have achieved the
top three position in the Institutional Securities business over the last number of years. But, as you say, on the
margin, we have lost share to the number one and number two. And I think our view has been that, that is a trade
that we've been willing to make both to continue to toggle the organization to the kind of revenue and profitability
mix that you see today, but also importantly the preservation of capital which allows us today, irrespective of
where we are in Basel III endgame, to have a CET1 ratio that is well above 15%. As you've heard, I am with the
team much focused on the durability of the dividend. And so, there's been real focus on what shareholders want
and what the business model ought to be for folks that want a durable Morgan Stanley.
Now, that having been said, what you saw in 2020 was that we can be quite agile about getting capital resourcing
to the client base if the tailwinds are there. Part of the proposition of being a global investment bank is that if, for
example, balances start working in the prime brokerage context towards their 2021, 2022 highs, where we're
about 10% away from those figures, well then, perhaps capital needs to be put towards equities, namely the
prime brokerage business in behalf of clients. There may be other periods where the events space, which was an
allusion made on the previous question with respect to activity around financial sponsors, that that activity may
come back because, of course, at some point, these large assets need to trade and the sponsor community is
dependent, at some level, on the Street to engage in velocity.
So, there is no strategic decision at all to withdraw from the Investment Bank. I think what we would say in 2024 is
that there – it's not really a choice between Wealth and Investment Management or the Institutional Securities
business, we will engage in both activities, but we will not be looking to chase the ball simply to have wallet share.
The name of the game is to have an income statement that demonstrates operating leverage in each of the two
businesses and ultimately to get to a holistic return.
So, we are much focused on what the durability of that capital put to use is and where we can serve clients over a
long period of time. We're paying attention to it very carefully. And what I'm most excited about, Christian, is that
the cycle that's coming – the investment banking-led cycle is coming at a time when we spent years putting
together, and I know you've met some of these folks, our so-called integrated investment bank. What is
differentiated about this place is that we have bankers, equities people, and fixed income folks who work together.
They work together on client solutions.
What I'm proposing on our behalf is now we extend that proposition to the Firm where in the Wealth business, the
Investment Management business, and inside the Investment Bank we can work together around clients,
ultimately, to generate operating leverage and returns. And that is, for me, the most exciting part of the next
chapter, which is we've got the team, we've got the excess capital. But, again, I like the excess capital because
it's part of what has differentiated us from the group and allows us to weather whatever comes through on a Basel
III endgame.
I would add, if in fact the Basel III endgame outcome is more favorable than perhaps what the Street expects, we
will adjust accordingly. But we have tools, and part of that's the dividend, part of that's investing in the business,
part of that, obviously, is buying stock back but, ultimately, having a real capital cushion is something that
shareholders have come to expect from James, and that's something they should continue to expect from me.

And then maybe a – another one on Wealth Management margins, unfortunately, maybe for Sharon. I kind of
hear you, Sharon, very clearly that you think higher revenues will drive margins over time. But I guess – but if – I
guess, if I look at the business 2019 versus today, Wealth Management revenues are up 50% versus where they
were in 2019, but your margins have compressed. And again, I know there's one-time items in the quarter – or in
the year, but it doesn't seem to me like bigger revenues have driven operating leverage. So, what gives you
confidence that, going forward, revenue growth will drive meaningful operating leverage?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Really around the conversion, that's why I keep talking about the conversion, Christian. We brought the statistics
up last year. We've brought the statistics up again this year in terms of seeing conversion from workplace, about
seeing net new assets coming in and then seeing those assets migrate, new clients giving FAs time, all of those
things are able to give us more durable asset management-based revenue as we move forward.
So, to your question, and I think Steve asked a similar question, the NII will fluctuate, obviously, based on rates
and on consumer and customer behavior. And so, the goal, while that has been something that we – we say,
don't forget the bank, don't forget the margin you'll get from that, over time, the goal is to have a more sustainable
trillion dollars of assets coming through both Wealth and Investment Management. Those assets will earn fees to
some portion of it, and we see the migration into fee-based, right? We have 50% of advisor-led assets sitting in
fee-based accounts. That's the ultimate proposition from seeing an expanded margin and seeing the benefits of
scale.
And we have invested in workplace. We've invested in getting new channels and getting new participants. The
time is now to begin to see conversion. And we have evidence, factual evidence that I pointed to on this call, to
show you that we're making progress towards those goals.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward N. Pick A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Morgan Stanley
What I'd add, Christian, is, again, all goals being equally important, we will hit that $10 trillion number. So, part of
it is to allow for some of this latency, if you will, on assets held away, on assets working their way through
workplace. It's a space that we are a leader in. It's a space that is relatively embryonic in the Wealth business.
And we will allow for some time for those assets to convert, but the key, of course, is to have them in-house and
then as well to see that folks who are new workplace customers have assets held away in other existing
brokerage accounts that they bring them to the Firm as well.

Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning, and congrats to Ted on the new role. Since I only get one shot at this, I will ask on the long-term
targets. So, there were some slight changes here. We lost some pluses, and we lost a [ph] less than (01:04:12)
on the efficiency ratio, although in fairness we gained a plus on the client assets. So, was that a reflection of –
these are long-term targets, so, I'm guessing it's not really a reflection of the current environment. So, what drove
the tweak there to maybe signal some reduction in some of the upside scenarios?

And how – you've referenced the fact that you need the environment to normalize. How should we be thinking
about progression towards these targets and what specific non-environmental actions you can be taking in order
to move the ball there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward N. Pick A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Morgan Stanley
Yes. Excellent question. And a lot of time given to consideration on pluses and the like. This for me was sort of an
easy call. The page is one that we all own, and getting to 30% margins is a number that we want to achieve. And
at that level, having hit something that is approaching $10 trillion assets, we're going to be in a really great place.
And that would be a reasonable time to say, hey, how about more, and we would say, okay, well, clearly we're
going to continue to grow assets because the asset number, way that TAM is, is gigantic. James has mentioned
that $20 trillion at one point. There are client assets that will keep us busy for many generations to come.
Whether the pre-tax margin of Wealth should go above 30% at that point, before or not, I'd like to get to the 30%,
and I want to get there durably and thoughtfully. And the mid-20s is a range that you've seen us trade at, the
business to work well at. And we believe we can when economic conditions normalize, as Sharon has described,
and as new assets get put to work, some combination of money markets and T-bills coming into the market again,
workplace coming through the funnel, all three channels working on the back of increased transaction activity and
new issues and the like, we should slowly and durably work our way back to the 30%.
Efficiency ratio, as you know, is just another way of saying 30% margins for the enterprise. Now, by definition, the
Investment Bank, which has more capital and more underlying risk, should have margins that exceed 30% over
time. So, it's fair to say that if we're hitting 30% margins in Wealth Management, we certainly should be at an
enterprise efficiency ratio of 1 minus 70, 30% as well. So, the 30%-plus could be a way of thinking about it, but I
wanted to set up numbers where the team knew that they are specific and that we needed to hit them.
And then finally with respect to returns on capital, this gets to the importance of our being stewards of that capital,
what we pay out in the form of dividends, what we buy back, and durably how we run the place. So, we thought
that 20% ROTCE, which is something we hit during the COVID years, but of course, those were against
macroeconomic conditions which were unusual and highly favorable, that we can do 20% in a normalized
environment.
So, this may be on the margin, and James liked it too when we talked about it. Stylistically my view was, and the
team shares it, that $10 trillion of client assets, we should get there and just keep on going. But the other three,
effectively in removing the pluses, it's simply reaffirming that those numbers will be hit. We will hit 30% pre-tax
margins in Wealth, 70% efficiency ratio for the Firm, and 20% ROTCE. It will take time. There will be the
challenges you would expect in making that happen, and of course, we need economic conditions to line up in a
favorable way. But over time, those are the Firm-wide goals, and we wanted to be very specific about that for you.

Okay. Well, it looks like you have a heavy lift after following James Gorman's [ph] true path (01:09:03). What is
your message to the wealth managers and investment managers, that half of the company that you haven't run in
the past? So, you've proven yourself in the half of the company that's clearly capital markets and Wall Street
banking, but what's your message to the other half of the company at a time when they've had a step-down in
their growth rates, new asset flows on Wealth and outflows in Investment Management?

Edward N. Pick A

Well, thanks for the question, Mike. The Wealth business is actually in my blood. My dad and my father-in-law
were both brokers once upon a time, and I grew up studying that business as a kid. And I think it is absolutely that
which has differentiated Morgan Stanley during this 15-year period. The ability to integrate Smith Barney and
build out something that is truly special has been existentially, as you know better than most, but also thematically
exactly what the Firm has needed. In no way has it actually worked to the disbenefit of the Investment Bank. As
you know, the history of our merger from 1997 was largely about social issues, but the industrial idea wasn't
necessarily off at all. To build a world-class wealth manager would be something that would have enormous
barriers to entry and if run well and run in a first-class way, could deliver value to clients in a differentiated
manner.
And what we have done, thanks to the leadership of Andy Saperstein, with Jed Finn, and then in the Investment
Management business with Dan Simkowitz now moving over to Investment Bank, and Ben Huneke and Jacques
Chappuis running Investment Management today, is we've got effectively the full funnel. We've got the soup to
nuts self-directed, the traditional advisory channel, and this new channel, workplace, working as one.
I've spent time working some of the Chairmens and hitting a branch here in midtown and spending some time with
folks that are actually making the engine work, and I think it's fair to say that we at one point were calling the
Wealth and Investment Management business the ballast which was the right word because we wanted to convey
durability. But I'd submit to you, Mike, and hopefully you'll appreciate the spirit in which I say this, I think it's
actually the engine. I think this will be the engine for further Morgan Stanley growth.
If opportunities were to come before us in the years to come, of course, we could staple them on and do
something inorganically. As James alluded to, perhaps that would be outside the US where I've spent a whole
bunch of time. But in running the actual organic business as it currently stands, we are truly a group of one. And
as you know, having spent time inside the knitting of MS, what we're most excited about, Mike, you as a student

of corporate culture and these investment banks, I think what you would be most excited about is just how well we
all get along. There is zero friction in the leadership ranks across infrastructure, across Wealth and Investment
Management, and across the Investment Bank.
So, the beauty of where we are today is that all of us, the shareholders and custodians of the Morgan Stanley
idea and the Morgan Stanley culture of first-class business in a first-class way, are very much focused on growing
both pieces of the Firm. And this leading wealth and asset manager has a lot more room and will grow, as I said,
to the $10 trillion of assets. And at the same time, I don't see any reason why we can't continue to pick up high
quality, durable wallet inside the Investment Bank and generate operating leverage in that business, too.
