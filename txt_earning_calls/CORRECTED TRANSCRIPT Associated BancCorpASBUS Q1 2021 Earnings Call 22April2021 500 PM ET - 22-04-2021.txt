Q1 2021 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2021
Thank you. Welcome to our first quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining me today are Chris Niles, our Chief Financial
Officer; and Pat Ahern, our Chief Credit Officer. Before discussing our results for the first quarter, I should note
that this will be my last time leading the quarterly earnings call for Associated. Next week, I'll be passing the baton
to Andy Harmening, who'll be stepping in as President and Chief Executive Officer on April 28.
Andy is a highly regarded banking leader with more than 25 years of experience and a track record of driving
profitable growth and operational excellence, improving customers' experience, and spearheading innovative
digital products. I'm proud of the progress the Associated team has made as we pursued our vision of becoming
one of the Midwest premier financial institutions. And I'm highly confident that Andy will take Associated to our
next phase of success and continue our profitable growth trajectory. I look forward to working with Andy as he
takes over and serving in an advisory capacity to support the company.
Let me now turn to our first quarter results. It's almost trite to say that the past 12 months have been unlike
anything we've experienced before. But during the first quarter of 2021, we've seen steadily increasing availability
of COVID-19 vaccinations throughout our markets, businesses have started to reopen, and encouraged by these
trends, our frontline teams are back in front of clients and working directly with our customers.
We've also continued to invest in and deploy technologies to meet our customers' banking needs when and
where they need us. With the economy showing signs of improvement, credit dynamics have continued to
improve across all of our portfolios. Our customers remain liquid, continue to pay down their credit lines and are
positioning themselves for the expected economic recovery later this year. As we celebrate our 160th year as a
company, we see many signs of a strengthening economy in our markets.
The first quarter's highlights are detailed on slide 2. Our first quarter earnings per share were $0.58, up 45% from
the fourth quarter. We saw a strong fee income trends in the first quarter. Mortgage banking income, capital
markets and wealth management all grew. Taken together, this strength in fee income offset the impacts of
LIBOR compression and mortgage refinancing activity which weighed on our net interest margin.
We also continued to see record levels of checking account deposit inflows, driven by additional government
stimulus. While this added liquidity, also compressed margins, we continued to grow our lowest cost deposits,
which accounted for 65% of total deposits at the end of the quarter. This liquidity positions us to meet what we
expect will be rising loan demand later this year.
Shifting to credit, we've been very pleased with the rapidly improving credit environment in early 2021, which
speaks to the strength of our markets in the Upper Midwest. Non-accrual loans were down 23% quarter-over-
quarter, while net charge-offs fell to just $5 million or down about 83% from the fourth quarter. We also posted a
negative provision for the quarter. Together, charge-offs and the negative provision drove a net reserve release of
$28 million.
We finished the quarter with strong capital and repurchased $18 million of common stock during Q1. Our tangible
book value per share increased to $16.95 as of the end of the month, and all our capital ratios improved year-
over-year.
On slide 3, we've provided a summary of our quarterly pre-tax pre-provision income, which has remained
relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. Adjusting for the branch and other sales activity, the quarter-over-quarter
change is even flatter.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2021
Turning to slide 4, we highlight changes in quarterly loan trends. Compared to the first quarter of 2020, average
first quarter loans increased $1.2 billion or 5%. On a sequential quarter-end of period basis, we saw solid growth
in our specialty lending and construction portfolios, along with renewed PPP activity. However, we continued to
see liquidity-driven pay-down activity impact our general commercial portfolio driven by lower line utilization.
Similarly, while mortgage warehouse and our own mortgage banking group benefited from the ongoing refi wave,
the same activity drove our residential mortgage and HELOC balances lower during the quarter. We continued to
enjoy strong mortgage originations, but as we've discussed previously, we've been reluctant to add low-rate
mortgages to our balance sheet. Looking forward, we remain optimistic around loan growth going into the latter
part of this year, specifically on commercial real estate lending, we expect construction lending to continue at a
strong pace and to drive increasing average CRE balances by 4% to 6% during 2021.
In addition, while we expect most of our outstanding PPP loans from rounds one and two to be paid off or forgiven
during the first half of the year, we've seen good traction on round three PPP activity, where we've supported
nearly 5,000 customers as of today. We expect round three originations to peak in Q2 at about $320 million. In
total, we expect to have supported over 13,000 small and medium-sized businesses with more than $1.3 billion in
loans. We remain optimistic about commercial loan demand in the back half of the year and still expect full-year
commercial loan growth, that is CRE and C&I combined, excluding the PPP loans of approximately 2% to 4%.
With respect to residential mortgage, we continue to expect balance contraction from the ongoing refinancing
activity. However, we expect any revenue contraction will be offset by incremental mortgage banking fee income
as we saw in Q1.
We'd also like to update you on our new auto lending initiative. We're expanding our consumer lending platform to
add indirect auto lending to our product set. To date, we've hired over 40 people from KeyBank, including all the
senior leadership, and expect to end the year with a total of 55 to 60 full-time equivalent employees as we build
out this business. We expect to begin originating indirect auto paper by the fall, with production of $200 million or
more in 2021, adding to and diversifying our total consumer portfolio.
We expect the portfolio's net yields to exceed those in our residential mortgage book as we achieve scale. We
expect the indirect auto financials will be more or less run rate neutral by year-end, with income derived from Q4
loan volumes offsetting the ongoing costs. We expect this business to be accretive in 2022 and, of course,
beyond. We aspire to grow our indirect auto outstandings into a multi-billion dollar loan portfolio over time.
Moving to slide 5, we continue to see all-time record deposit levels for Associated customers, reflecting our ability
to retain our core customers in a low rate and largely remote banking environment. Our retention rates have been
improving now for seven years and reflecting more than half of attrition over that time period. Our customer
interaction and call center survey data continues to suggest our customers have been well served despite the
challenges posed by the pandemic.
I'm particularly excited to tell you that we are currently in first place and leading the Upper Midwest region in the
J.D. Power Retail Banking Study and we expect to be recognized by J.D. Power as number one for the Upper
Midwest when final results are released next week. These positive customer dynamics are reflected in the strong
growth of first quarter average deposits, which were up $2.5 billion or 10% over the first quarter of 2020. This
growth reflects strong trends in our lowest cost deposit categories, which grew by approximately $3.5 billion from
the same period a year ago, while we continued to reduce higher cost network and time deposits by over $1.3
billion.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2021
From a quarter-over-quarter standpoint, end-of-period noninterest-bearing checking and savings were up $834
million and $383 million, respectively, from the fourth quarter, driving our low-cost deposits to their highest levels
ever. At the end of the first quarter, low-cost deposits accounted for approximately 65% of our balances, marked
by steady growth in checking and savings categories specifically.
Turning to slide six, we had previously indicated that dollar net interest income would be reduced by day count,
LIBOR and refinancing pressures during Q1. And in fact, first quarter net interest income was $176 million, down
$12 million from the fourth quarter. As you can see from the chart on the right, the most significant drop in our
realized yields was in our residential mortgage portfolio, which came down by 21 basis points reflecting the impact
of prepayments and refi activity on the books.
The declining asset yields were partially offset by continuing improvement on the interest expense side where the
additional influx of low-cost customer deposits combined with lower levels of borrowing continued to drive our
interest expense lower. While the 10-basis-point quarterly drop in margin was more than we had expected, as we
look forward, we continue to expect our net interest margin to gradually expand over the course of the second
through fourth quarters.
Slide 7 shows a breakdown of the specific factors that impacted net interest income in Q1. As we indicated on the
prior slide, key factors for the quarter were mortgage refinance-driven impacts such as premium and origination
cost amortization, which depressed net interest income by approximately $9 million for the quarter. However,
these costs were offset by an increase in net mortgage banking income over the course of the quarter and we
expect mortgage yields to rebound as the current refinance wave slows in Q2.
On the commercial side, our LIBOR-based loans were impacted by day count, the LIBOR rate compression in
February and March and slower PPP forgiveness relative to Q4. While these impacts played a significant role in
Q1, we expect them to moderate as we move through the year. Further, we expect spreads to widen on our
LIBOR-based commercial loans as we continue to implement new LIBOR floors into our new and renewing loans.
This will happen over time or in conjunction with other refinance, repricing or credit actions, including the
anticipated migration to SOFR or other indices later this year.
We also still have over $140 million in consumer CDs, with weighted average rates above 2% set to mature by
the end of the third quarter. Given the first quarter's margin, current rates, and ongoing refi activity, we're revising
our margin outlook for the full year to 2.45% to 2.55%.
Turning to slide 8, first quarter non-interest income came on at $95 million, up over 11% from the fourth quarter,
reflecting the positive side of the mortgage refinance wave, expanding fee-based revenues, and strong capital
markets activity. As can be seen on the right side of this slide, mortgage banking income was up $9 million
quarter-over-quarter as we recovered much of the MSR valuation we wrote down last year in the declining rate
environment. We anticipate Q2 2021 will reflect continued strength in mortgage banking income, but we expect
this activity to moderate as we move later into the year.
Capital markets fees came in at $8 million, an increase of 38% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting an active
syndications and risk management market. Wealth management fees also increased slightly for the first quarter,
buoyed by strong equity markets. We note that the sale of Whitnell are closed on March 1 and we still ended the
quarter with over $12.5 billion of assets under management and more than 20% year-over-year growth rate.
As a further positive, we've seen increasing card activity and purchase levels throughout our customer base,
including record credit and debit card spend in the month of March. We also recorded gains on the sale of

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2021
Whitnell to Rockefeller, the further disposition of branches during the quarter, and other investments which totaled
nearly $6 million. Given the above, we are updating and increasing our full-year fee income outlook by $30 million
to reflect noninterest income expectations of $310 million to $330 million in 2021.
On slide 9, we highlight our expenses. The first quarter came in at $175 million, a slight increase from the fourth
quarter. Personnel expenses rose by $6 million for the quarter, driven by increased compensation and incentives,
higher mortgage commission expense, and the addition of the team we brought in to support our new indirect
auto lending initiative. As a partial offset, other core expenses continued to trend lower, driven by a reduction of
expense following the sale of Whitnell and an additional branch sale that closed during the quarter. After
combining the added expenses tied to compensation and incentives, mortgage commissions and the indirect auto
initiative, we're revising our initial full-year 2021 expense outlook from approximately $675 million to between
$690 million and $695 million.
The allowance update is shown on slide 10. We utilized the Moody's March 2021 baseline forecast for our CECL
forward-looking assumptions. The Moody's baseline forecast assumes additional stimulus, a continuing low rate
environment and widely available and effective COVID vaccines. Following the net reserve release of $11 million
in the fourth quarter, we posted a further net reserve release of an additional $28 million in the first quarter of
2021. This net release was driven by gross reductions in our allowance for all of our core business units with a
$15 million gross reduction in our allowance related to our general, commercial and business lending portfolio, a
$9 million reduction in our CRE allowance and a $4 million reduction in retail lending.
As of March 31, our total allowance was $404 million, down from $431 million in the prior quarter. Similarly, our
ratio of reserves to loans declined to 1.67% from 1.76% during the quarter. We expect the allowance for loans to
drop back down to approximately CECL day one levels by the end of 2021.
Our quarterly credit trends are presented on slide 11. Potential problem loans, non-accrual loans and net charge-
offs all declined during the quarter. Our key COVID commercial exposures also continued to decline, notably oil
and gas, retail and restaurant exposures all declined year in the quarter.
After peaking at $1.6 billion in the second quarter of 2020, our quarterly active loan deferrals have continued to
decline and fell to a total of just $37 million across all our core business units in the first quarter. Total deferrals
now make up just 15 basis points of total loans at quarter-end. We've continued to see positive trends here. Very
pleased with where we've ended. Most customers who received deferrals have not needed additional assistance
and have been able to resume making normal payments. Assuming the positive credit dynamics continue, we
would expect a very nominal net provision for the year.
As shown on slide 12, our regulatory capital levels remain strong. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased 31
basis points from the fourth quarter, and has grown 140 basis points from the first quarter of 2020 as we
conserved capital in light of economic uncertainty. We'll continue to target TCE levels at or above 7.5% and CET1
at or above 9.5%.
And so on slide 13, we recap our updated guidance for 2021. We're revising our net interest margin guidance
down to reflect the ongoing prepayment dynamics to reflect a full-year margin of approximately 2.45% to 2.55%.
We're revising our non-interest income guidance up by $30 million, reflecting our positive fee income trends. We
now expect the full year to come in between $310 million and $330 million. We expect this additional strength in
our fee businesses to outpace the downward pressure on the margin.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2021
We're revising our expense guidance upward to approximately $690 million to $695 million, driven by additional
incentive and compensation expense, additional mortgage commissions, and additional personnel expense to
support our new indirect auto initiative. Given the credit trends we continue to see and assuming the economy
continues to perform positively as we generally expect, we now believe that 2021 full year provision will be very
nominal.
Finally, given higher levels of profitability, we expect our annual tax rate to normalize in the 19% to 21% range,
assuming no change in the corporate tax rate.
With that, I'd be happy to take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first
question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good afternoon, guys. Thank you for taking the question. And I guess before we get started, so Phil, best of luck.

Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Thank you, Scott.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah, you bet. First question just the – sort of the nuance of the factors in the fee improvement, I think just doing
the math, it looks like a lot of the improvement we kind of already captured it in the reported first quarter numbers.
Just curious how you guys are thinking about the remainder of the year, is there any sort of core improvement to
the way you're thinking things will trend? It certainly sounds like mortgage will stay strong at least through the
second quarter, but just sort of on a go-forward basis, curious how you guys are thinking about that fee
momentum.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So mortgage banking is going to remain strong for a while, as you said. Our capital markets business
should continue to perform very well. We think that consumer spending is going to drive debit and credit. We
already saw record levels and I would imagine we're going to start breaking records month after month going
forward. We, of course, do think that we're going to have significant loan demand in the back half and that will add
some fee income as well. So we feel very good about our noninterest income outlook, which is why we raised that
guidance by $30 million for the year.

Yes, Scott. So those are presented on slide 3 of the tables. There's $18 million at the end of the year, roughly $6
million from the first two rounds and $12 million from the new round here in Q1.

question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Hey. Good afternoon and best of luck, Phil, on the next chapter. This is [indiscernible] (00:22:52) for Casey Haire.
Just wanted to touch on auto, what kind of credit box are you looking at for this product, maybe can you tell us a
little bit about the FICO and potential loss rates? And I appreciate, I think you mentioned $200 million by the
fourth quarter – or in the fourth quarter. As you build out to get to make this a several billion dollar item, kind of
what are you thinking for 2022 for this product?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So, little early to give you that much specific detail yet. I can tell you that given our own credit appetite that
you're probably familiar with or Casey is that we're going to be operating in the higher credit quality area in the
prime and near-prime ZIP code. We've hired, as I mentioned, the team from KeyBank and we've also actually
bought some of the intellectual property from KeyBank to be able to jumpstart this business and operate within
what was their, we think, relatively conservative and successful credit box. So, more detail to come as we get this
going. We still have work to do on systems to be able to stand up the business, but we'll give you updates as the
year goes on. As far as where we're going to be next year, probably a little too early to give you that information,
but we'll certainly share that as the year goes on.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Okay. And separately just on capital, you're still well above your CET1 ratio. I guess what's holding you back from
maybe doing a little bit bigger buybacks going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, nothing is necessarily holding us back. We have a significant authorization still remaining from the board.
And as you know, we have a new CEO starting next week. So how we implement future buybacks will be
reviewed. And as always, we will be thoughtful about how we deploy that capital, doing it in an opportunistic way
and beyond that, we also never tell anyone exactly when we're going to do it.

Okay, fair. Thank you.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris McGratty with KBW. Please proceed with your
question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Thanks for the question. Maybe, Chris, for you, I'm kind of interested in more on the outlook for NII and
maybe I missed it, but given the downward draft in margin, I guess excluding the PPP, how should we think about
the trajectory of net interest income from current levels [indiscernible] (00:25:57)?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yes. So we do think the quarterly NII has bottomed. We do believe, as I draw your attention to page 7, the net
interest walk-forward dynamics, we believe the mortgage refinance-driven dynamics will abate and turn from the
strong negative they were this quarter to, with the sort of decrease in premium amortization and origination cost
amortization, move to a better level. We believe the commercial and business lending volumes will drive that to a
more positive place.
Obviously, we'll have a few more days in future quarter day counts and we continue to believe we will manage the
interest expense lower as we move through the year. And you sort of bring that all together and we see a positive
bridge to Q2 and a further positive in particular bridge into Q3 when we expect we'll see more of the loan growth,
particularly on the commercial side.
I would note that our commercial and business core customers are at decade-low line utilization levels. And so
what you have is a mix going on where our traditional core yield and spread customer base is at a low point and
we think as we move certainly into the third and certainly into the fourth, they will return to a more normal high
borrowing levels, maybe not normal immediately, but they will start to normalize. And that spread will start to
reemerge, which is what we typically would see during the recovery or expansion cycle.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. That's great color. Thank you. And on the provision, just given where we I guess started, how negative it
was and the constructive comments, I hate to parse words, but nominal provision would suggest that there's a
meaningful positive provisions and I'm just trying to get a sense of the element of conservatism.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, what I said was very nominal. So, look, credit has improved dramatically and from CECL day one through
the first two quarters, we were ramping up our reserves. You've seen us start to release now in the fourth quarter
and the first quarter. We're getting remarkable outcomes in credits that we were concerned about, stuff that we
thought we had lost content in has been fully repaid. We've seen that now twice just in the last month, sizable
credits. So the provision is going to be very low. How is that?

It's line utilization. We're sitting right now, Jon, at about 32%, which is the lowest it's ever been. We would
normally run in the mid-40s. So I mean, if nothing else, since things tend to revert back to where – to the mean,
there's a significant amount of untapped outstandings there that I believe you're going to start to see come on
pretty hard as we get into the later part of the year. With the business activity that we're seeing and the
conversations we're having with our customers around the Upper Midwest, inventories are going to have to start
to build, receivables are going to start to be generated and that stuff is going to have to be financed. So we do
believe that line utilization alone is going to drive significant pickup in C&I as we get into the year.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
I guess it ties to the next question, the period-end noninterest-bearing in savings and money market growth, so
much higher than your average is. Every bank has experienced it, but do you expect that to come back down
when the line utilization starts to pick up or do you expect this stuff to stick around for a while?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, a lot of it's sitting in retail accounts, of course, with all the stimulus money that went out. So I expect
consumers will start to spend money and that those dollars will come down. Our commercial borrowers aren't
sitting on all that money. It's mostly out on the retail side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And then just a random one, but you talked about the J.D. Power ranking.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Where were you in the past? I mean we don't have to go back to 2009, but what...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
We were kind of average. I mean, we were – we did fine, but we weren't a standout on that measure. And we've
made huge efforts over the years to really become a customer-facing and customer-centric organization. And I
have to tell you, that on my last earnings call, it's kind of gratifying to be able to say that we're going to be number
one in the Upper Midwest for retail customer satisfaction.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
I remember the first call, I think it was January 2010 and it's kind of a mess. So this is something to be proud of,
Phil, for sure. So well, thanks for everything, Phil. Good luck.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Please proceed with your
question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Good afternoon. And I remember that call in 2010. It was a mess to Jon's point and the bank's significantly
healthier today on your last call, Phil. So, enjoyed working with you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Thank you, Terry.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
I guess just circling back on the indirect auto and I apologize, my phone line broke up a little bit when you were
talking about that business. Could you just run through, I guess, did you evaluate any other lending verticals or
was this the team presented itself and you had an interest, the incoming CEO, his bank has a strong history in
that business, did that come into play? And then just the last part, the expenses, and I appreciate the update, will
there be incremental expenses next year that we should contemplate as we model out 2022?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yes. Great questions. Probably little early for me to give you much guidance on 2022 expenses, but I can tell you
that and as we talked about, we have built a conservative credit book here for many years, which also is a
relatively low-yielding credit book. I mean those things obviously go hand in hand. We've been looking for another
asset class to enter that we were comfortable with that has higher yields attached to it. And so we settled in on
the indirect auto lending business because after home lending, in its various forms and the credit card biz, it's the
next asset class for consumers that makes a difference, just based on the size of the market and the size of those
purchases for the average household.
So we had actually settled on pursuing this business. The KeyBank team presented itself fortuitously as we were
thinking this through and so we went after that aggressively. And all of that was underway actually before the
board hired Andy. So it's fortuitous but coincidental that he's coming from a bank that does have a large presence
in the indirect auto space.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
That's great. That is it on my list. Thanks, everyone. Thanks, Phil.

Thank you.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Young with Truist. Please proceed with your
question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Sorry for another follow-up on the indirect auto. But first of all, would that be
a regional book and really kind of cross-sell within the core customer base initially and then walked out further or
how do you kind of look at that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Actually, our intention is to be active in originating this indirect auto paper from the Northeast all the way through
to our footprint. So that's the initial footprint that we're looking at and that lines up basically with the team that
we've hired from Key.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Right, okay. And then maybe just a philosophical question there, we've seen a lot of banks exit that business or
get out back when losses were a little higher a couple of years back and there were some worry or concern there.
So is there anything that you all view differently when you were kind of reviewing it, whether it be a scale issue or
CECL impacts, anything like that that kind of led you to believe this was a good business to be in, whereas others
have kind of exited at different times?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. As I was describing to Terry a moment ago, we do feel the need to seek some asset classes with higher
yield and something that could make a difference. We think that conservatively and properly run, this is a perfectly
fine business that will generate appropriate RAROCs. But critical to making that decision was finding an
experienced team with a proven track record of success to run it for us and that's what we were able to find with
the KeyBank team.
If you think about the history of this bank expanding outside of its footprint into other areas, for example, our loan
production offices that have focused on commercial real estate in places like Dallas and Michigan and Ohio and
other places, we are always very careful to make sure that the most important aspect was find the right leadership
team to run those operations with experience in those markets. And it's a different asset class than commercial
real estate, but the same philosophy applies here.
We have found a great senior leadership team and we have found they have the ability to bring along significant
amount of the rest of their team with us. So we're not trying to, as novices, get into this business. We're bringing
experienced people on to help us do that. It's also true that many of us here, whether it's myself or Dave Stein or
others in previous organizations have been involved in the business. So although I wouldn't certainly call any of
us experts compared to the people that we brought on, we have significant familiarity with it.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2021
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And maybe one last one, if I could sneak it in just on kind of the potential infrastructure bill, you talked
about the positivity and kind of outlook in commercial and I guess, ramping production. Have you had a lot of just
anecdotal conversations where people are getting prepared or ramping up supplies, et cetera, for that already or
are people kind of taking a wait-and-see approach?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
No, our borrowers who are in that space, for example, we have a decent-sized portfolio of heavy civil contractors
that we run out of Minneapolis. They're, of course, eager and willing and anxious to get going and we're there to
support them. So yeah, I mean, our customers are gearing up. I mean this is still – it's still conversation right now
in D.C. We would certainly expect to see something happening and our customers expect it to happen as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. That is all for me. Thanks and congrats, Phil, on your time.

Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your
question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hi, guys. Just a couple of follow-ups. First, so looking at the guidance, I think it implies costs are going to actually
come down from the first quarter run rate. So are the auto build-out costs already embedded in there or like where
are the – I guess, where are the savings coming from that would allow you to have down costs through the
remainder of the year vis-à-vis the first-quarter run rate?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. So we've already hired more than half of that team during the course of the first quarter, so some of those
costs are already in there and our guidance, of course, takes into account all of the costs for the rest of the year.
Know that our first quarter expenses usually are a little bit higher just from compensation activity and incentive
activity and such. So, yeah, I mean, at $690 million to $695 million, it's a little less than the $700 million run rate,
but that would be not unexpected given the normal seasonal pattern of our expenses.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Good. All right. And then just on the margin guidance of 2.45% to 2.55%, are we talking there a reported
margin, like including the impact of the PPP fees or are we thinking sort of off that sort of core base of, I've
estimated around, 2.32% or so excluding the PPP fees?
