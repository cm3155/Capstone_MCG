With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, I will cover a number of topics. First, I'll briefly
discuss our first half 2021 operating results. Second, I will cover recent balance sheet trends. Third, I'll review our
issuance program. And finally, I'll discuss our continued strong liquidity and capital position.
Slide 3 summarizes our results for the second quarter and first half of 2021. In the second quarter, we reported
net income of $6.2 billion. And for the half, we reported $14.1 billion, both higher than comparable periods in
2020, driven by significant reserve releases.
On slide 4, we show average balance sheet trends over the past five quarters in constant dollars. On this basis,
we have grown our balance sheet by approximately 1% over the last year, as we continued to support our
consumer and institutional clients as they manage through the COVID-19 health crisis while also maintaining a
strong balance sheet.
In the second quarter, deposits continued to grow, reflecting continued engagement with our consumer and
corporate clients in a period of elevated liquidity. Loans increased sequentially, driven by growth in ICG, while
consumer loans remained under pressure, driven by elevated payment rates.
Trading-related assets and liabilities grew, reflecting a continuation of strong client engagement. And long-term
debt decreased, as we continued to optimize our balance sheet, given our strong liquidity position and deposit
growth.
Slide 5 presents trends in our loan portfolio on an average basis in constant dollars. Total Citigroup loans
decreased 7% year over year. In our consumer franchise, average loans declined 4% year over year, as high
levels of liquidity continued to drive elevated payment rates.
In our institutional franchise, average loans decreased 8% year over year, as strong growth in Markets and
Private Bank was offset by repayments and reduced demand for loans in Corporate Lending. Sequentially, total
loans grew in TTS markets and the Private Bank, and Corporate Lending repayments slowed.
On slide 6, we show credit quality trends in our GCB and ICG loan portfolios. In ICG, credit quality remained
broadly stable. In the second quarter, non-accrual loans declined sequentially to $2.6 billion, or 64 basis points of
total loans, reflecting portfolio upgrades and repayments.
In GCB, overall credit trends improved, given high levels of liquidity in the US and improvements in international
consumer credit performance after losses peaked in the first quarter. And with credit reserves of $21.5 billion, we
believe we are well prepared for expected credit losses across both our consumer and institutional portfolios.
Turning to slide 7, we show trends in average deposits over the past five quarters in constant dollars. Total
average deposits increased 5% from the prior-year period, reflecting continued client engagement in a period of
elevated liquidity.
Now let me cover our Parent Benchmark Debt Issuance Program on slide 8. So far this year, we have issued
roughly $11 billion. Going forward, we'll continue to maintain the flexibility to issue a mix of tenors, currencies, and
structures, as we prudently manage the liquidity profile of the firm and support our clients.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 30-Jul-2021
On slide 9, let me cover our issuance, maturity, and redemption expectations. We previously expected issuance
of $15 billion to $20 billion, but we now expect issuance at the low end of that range, all in our Parent Benchmark
program, as we see elevated levels of liquidity in the bank. And we will maintain the flexibility to optimize our
funding through opportunistic redemptions.
On slide 10, we show the composition of our long-term debt outstanding. During the second quarter, our total
long-term debt increased by approximately $9 billion to roughly $265 billion, reflecting an increase in non-bank
debt, partly offset by a continued reduction in bank debt.
On slide 11, we provide an update of our LCR metrics and drivers. Our average LCR decreased modestly to
113% this quarter.
Turning to slide 12, let me summarize our key regulatory capital metrics. Our CET1 capital ratio increased
modestly to 11.9%, with net income largely offset by buybacks and dividends.
And our SLRs were 5.9% and 6.8% for Citigroup and Citibank, respectively. The decline in Citigroup's SLR from
the prior quarter was largely driven by the expiration of the temporary SLR relief.
Moving to our last slide, let me summarize several key points. The franchise continued to perform well through the
pandemic. We earned over $14 billion of net income in the first half, including a credit reserve release of roughly
$6 billion.
We maintained a strong capital position with a CET1 capital ratio of 11.9%, an SLR of 5.9% and a surplus above
our TLAC requirement. We also maintain a strong liquidity position with an average LCR of 113%, over $970
billion of available liquidity resources, and we are comfortably in compliance with the NSFR rule, which became
effective on July 1.
While we expect continued macroeconomic improvement, our capital and liquidity position us well for a range of
scenarios. And we continue to have the flexibility to deploy these resources in ways that deepen and expand our
client relationships and support the broader recovery.
Before we move on to Q&A, let me touch briefly on LIBOR. We appreciate the flexibility afforded by the IBA in
their extension of most tenors of US dollar LIBOR until mid-2023. As it relates to a legislative solution, the recently
enacted New York State law to address the phase-out of LIBOR as a benchmark rate is clearly a positive
development, as is the similar proposed federal legislation.
With regard to this subset of our preferreds, which we have mentioned on previous calls, while we are continuing
to evaluate alternatives, we don't have any further updates at this time.
With that, Mark and I will be happy to answer your questions.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 30-Jul-2021
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Scott Cavanagh of APG.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Cavanagh Q
Analyst, APG Asset Management US, Inc.
Good afternoon, guys. Thanks once again for having the call, two questions for you. First, looking at overall asset
quality and earnings momentum, we've seen, as you and your peers said, the improvement in the economy, the
ongoing strength in credit quality has definitely been a tailwind for bottom line earnings. But when we think about
the second half and going into next year, how should we think about the potential continued benefit from reserve
releases given your second quarter levels were still elevated to the day one, albeit lower than the first quarter of
2020?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Scott, good afternoon. You broke up a little bit. You said how should we think about in the second half what, just
repeat that part again, please?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Cavanagh Q
Analyst, APG Asset Management US, Inc.
Sorry, potential future benefit of reserve releases given the ongoing improvement in the economy, given the
absolute levels are still elevated to day one, there's the possibility that we go – the correct levels are below that,
so how should we think about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Got it, great question. And look, you're right, we have seen – on the heels of 2020, we have seen the economy
and the outlook improve, and that's been an important factor through quarter one and quarter two as we've seen
reserve releases play through. We've also, by the way, continued to have very strong client engagement and
strong underlying indicators around the prospect for a strong recovery that we feel good about.
As it relates to your question specifically on additional reserve releases, there are a number of factors that come
into play there. So one is the continued outlook for the macroeconomic indicators, how GDP, how unemployment
is likely to evolve. The second is how the portfolio mix changes. And as you know, we are starting to invest in
bringing on or acquiring new customer accounts and reactivating card activity with customers, and so that's going
to be a factor as loan balances begin to build. And then the last factor would be kind of the downside scenario that
we assume as we run these different CECL models that we have. And so hard to say with precision where this
ends up for the year. The way the indicators have been evolving, I would expect that we would see additional
reserve releases, but hard to call that precisely.
In terms of where we started on day one, whether that's the long-term level, those factors come into play again,
so what the portfolio looks like relative to what it looked like then, the outlook on the economy, et cetera, et cetera.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 30-Jul-2021
Scott Cavanagh Q
Analyst, APG Asset Management US, Inc.
Okay. And my follow-up question is on the issuance front. What are your current plans for future agreements?
You entered the affordable housing bond with great success. And then could you elaborate on the recent ICMA
debate about looking at the lookback period that's commonplace in the US green and sustainable bonds and the
potential for rolling your long-term assets within that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure, Scott. Hi there. It's Mike. Look, so we were happy with the programs that we brought in ESG, both green
and affordable housing. That's an area that's obviously important to the firm. We're going to continue to explore
opportunities to issue in that space. Of course, as I think about the issuance for the year and what we've done so
far and what we have left to do, it's a limited amount, but of course, we'll continue to explore opportunities, talk
with our investors, and really determining what the need is, both across tenors, currencies, as well as types,
including ESG.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Your next question is from Hima Inguva of Bank of America.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hima B. Inguva Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Great, thank you very much. And as usual, Mark, Mike, and Tom, thanks a lot for doing the call.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hima B. Inguva Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
We appreciate it. So my first question is around China, with all the regulatory crackdowns that are being talked
about. If you could, maybe elaborate a little bit on exposure in China, considering you've announced plans to exit
Retail Banking in Asia. That would be very helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure. Hi, Hima. How are you? Thanks for joining. Look, as you would imagine, we continue to monitor that
situation very closely.
While we have announced that we're exiting Retail Banking in Asia, we are continuing our very strong
performance in our ICG businesses around the world. We're not exiting any countries out of our ICG business.
And as such, we continue to serve our multinational companies and our local champions through this ICG
business that we have. And we don't anticipate any impact from some of the Chinese regulatory crackdowns, as
you characterize them, that have been in the press as of late.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 30-Jul-2021
Our total exposure in China, which we do disclose in our 10-Q, so it's out there in our first quarter 10-Q, is
approximately $20 billion. And that includes about $12 billion of funded loans and about $3.5 billion of funded
loans out of our consumer business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hima B. Inguva Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it, thank you very much for clarifying that. And the second question is around your perhaps issuance needs.
Maybe if you could elaborate on how we should think about it, remainder of the year, considering all the changes
that were made this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure. Hi, Hima. So no immediate need. As you know, we would typically, depending on market conditions, get out
in front of the call opportunities that we have, if it was economical. But we don't have calls for quite some time.
So it's really now about how our balance sheet evolves. And that of course is going to be a function of overall
economic activity. And then of course, markets are favorable, so we will consider that too.
So as always, we leave ourselves room to be opportunistic, and we'll take that into account and look at how the
balance sheet evolves. But again, nothing that's going to be driven by calls, just given we don't have anything in
the near future here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Your next question is from Arnold Kakuda of Bloomberg Intelligence.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arnold Shoichi Kakuda Q
Analyst, Bloomberg LP (Research)
Great, thanks for holding the call, guys. Really appreciate it. So it seems like – reading from the press, it seems
like you've reinstated a mask mandate in the US. So just curious in terms of if you have maybe some more
insights from your global footprint where there's been – the Delta variant has kind of been more of an issue versus
the US. So is that kind of what you guys are seeing? Or is it just more response to the CDC updated guidance?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah, sure, Arnold, good to hear from you. We obviously have a global footprint, and frankly we are handling this
pandemic as the local environments that we operate in would require. And so every market, every country we
handle uniquely, based on the data and not on any targeted date for when we want to get back into the office or
when you should or shouldn't wear a mask.
And so in the case of what you've read recently, it is in response to what everyone's seeing come out of the CDC.
We obviously want to adhere to the guidance that they provide. And what's most important is ensuring the safety
of our employee base. And so we'll continue to be led by data, whether it's data around returning to the office or
data around wearing face mask or whatever, because that's the right thing to do.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 30-Jul-2021
Got it, thank you. And then moving on to issuance, so it seems like you're lower than peer issuance has helped
your bonds outperform peers this year. And then you further kind of moved your target to the lower end of the
range.
So I'm just curious in terms of we've seen some of your peers have elevated issuance. If I can put it into two
buckets, one, maybe where the balance sheet expanded a lot during the pandemic, and so maybe with the SLR
relief going away, then you'd issue some other. In other cases, an opportunity opening up in prime brokerage, so
peers aggressively going after that market share.
So where do you guys kind of fit within that? Are there other things that you guys are able to do to kind of offset
some of these increased issuance pressures that maybe others have had?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure, Arnold. So when we think about issuance, and we've always talked about this, we like to maintain a lot of
flexibility. And we do that by ensuring we have multiple funding levers at our disposal, both in the bank and in the
non-bank.
Just starting off with the bank, clearly we've seen deposit growth over the past year. And so the need for any bank
issuance really is diminished, just given that good deposit growth that we've seen. And obviously, that's an activity
where it's a funding source, but it's also accommodating our client need.
When you think about the non-bank, it's similar that we have different funding sources. Of course, we have
financing activities, but we also maintain a commercial paper program. We have our client note program in
addition to of course our Parent Benchmark.
Now, in terms of need, as you've seen with TLAC, even after the expiration of the temporary relief, we end the
quarter roughly $16 billion, which is just about double where our targeted range had been. And if you look at our
liquidity levels, we've maintained good liquidity levels as well.
And so when you think about the need that we've had and how we've been funding, especially our non-bank
positions, we did use some of that liquidity in the quarter to fund that need, but at the same time, we saw good
client engagement in our note program. And keep in mind, that note program is really a client facilitation activity,
so it has the benefit of meeting our client needs while at the same time providing us funding, which is attractive
because it's a diverse investor base. It's retail and high net worth clients. And again, it's a diversification from our
Parent Benchmark program, and of course we still over the course of the year and in the quarter did come to the
market for that Parent program. And so really, it's about having the flexibility to source funding from different
avenues. And as I said, we've been in a good liquidity position, same with TLAC, and so that has afforded us the
flexibility to really optimize our sources of funding while meeting our client needs.
You mentioned Prime Brokerage, and of course, obviously our resources are going to be supporting our clients.
And of course we then turn to what is the most optimal way to fund those positions, and that's of course what I
just described.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
The only thing I'd add obviously is in the equities space in particular, we've seen very good progress straight
through the second quarter here. We're focused on getting the most out of the resources that we've dedicated to

the business. Overall, we're up almost 40% versus the second quarter last year, and prime and delta one are up
similar levels. And so good strength there, good client balanced growth there, and as Mike suggests, we're well
positioned to fund the opportunities as they present themselves as we do more with our clients.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Your final question is from Robert Smalley of UBS.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Smalley Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi, thanks very much for taking my questions and thanks for doing the call, two different questions. First on asset
quality, we're all waiting for loan growth. We're starting to see some of the beginnings of it. But number one, are
you concerned about the competitive environment at all? And number two, given that corporations and
consumers need to be in relatively good shape, are we setting ourselves up for an adverse selection type of
scenario where the first borrowers are the ones that really have needs?
Second question on deposits, you had big deposit growth last year, not so much in the first half. Could you break
that down a little bit, corporate versus consumer, what you're doing there to put a lid on deposit growth? And are
you doing that with a view toward the SLR? Or is the SLR just a coincidental indicator off the back of that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure. So why don't I get started on the loans piece, Robert? Thanks for the question. And then I'll touch on the
deposit question, and I'm sure Mike will want to add in on that as well.
So look, in the second quarter, we did return to sequential growth. And we saw that particularly in the ICG
business, in the Private Bank, in our trade loans – or with our trade loans in TTS and parts of our Markets
business. And we started to see as well increased spend in our North America Branded Cards business. And feel
pretty good about growth in loans playing out toward the end of the year as it relates to the Cards business.
And in part, that's because of what we're seeing in the way of the trend in payment rates. While they're still high,
we think they're going to trend in the direction that would support some loan growth at the end of the year. But
also the activity that we're ginning up with the marketing dollars that we're putting to work around bringing on or
acquiring new balances. And so we feel good about the prospect of loan growth toward the end of the year.
We also feel good about the underwriting that we've done. Many of these customers we've had for a long time.
We know the behavior patterns of those customers. We know that we have customers that are in a temporary
transactor state, so to speak.
And so as the stimulus starts to wind down, we would expect they will revert back to revolving activity, and that
will drive those loan balances. And this is a portfolio, both on the Branded Cards business as well as the Retail
Services business, and I stress that, because you have a mix of behavior that plays out when you have a portfolio
of the size that we have.
And so we do feel good about the prospect of loan growth. Obviously, the recovery and the pacing of that will be
an important factor. But the trends we're seeing in GDP forecast, the trends we're seeing in unemployment
forecasts all support that that should play through and that we should be well positioned to capture the benefit of
that loan growth.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 30-Jul-2021
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure. And on deposits, clearly we saw, as the Federal Reserve putting a lot of liquidity in the system, the industry
deposit rates growing quite rapidly.
But from our perspective, clearly we have ample deposits to fund our growth just based on what our need is. Now
obviously, we've been deploying some of that excess liquidity into securities. But also I'd say it's not about the
absolute level of deposits. We're working with our clients in meeting their needs as well as looking at the value of
those deposits and looking at the returns as well as the liquidity value associated with that activity.
If I think about consumer, we saw strong deposit growth there, particularly in the US, which allows us to continue
to execute on our strategy. Our overall consumer deposits were up 14% on the year. And when you look at North
America consumer, that was up 18%. And within that, checking balances were up 24%.
So we're very much focused on the types of deposits that we're taking in as well. And if you look at our broader
businesses and our institutional business, we continue to grow deposits there as well. Securities Services, again,
that's been driven by higher assets under custody. And if you look at Private Banking, we continued to grow and
deepen those relationships as well.
In TTS, down slightly, but that is also a function of optimizing that deposit base in the context of the overall client
relationship.
So it's really about focusing on meeting our client needs and really being thoughtful about how we take in those
deposits and the value of those deposits in terms of their deployment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
The only thing I'd add to that, Mike, is that – so you're right, relationship being the key word there. And that's how
we think about managing the deposit growth and momentum that we've seen. And that's critically important.
The deposit levels – to the other part of your question, the deposit levels do put pressure on the G-SIB score.
They do put pressure on SLR. And the regulators have referenced the importance of maintaining capital levels
throughout the industry, so to speak.
And so we're hopeful that their continued focus on the implications of this excess liquidity that's in the market and
these deposit levels and what they mean for these important factors that they continue to focus on that and that
that plays out in a way that allows them to maintain their objective of balanced or maintain capital levels.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 30-Jul-2021
Operator: We did have another question come in from Kevin Maloney of BlackRock.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin James Maloney Q
Analyst, BlackRock Advisors LLC
Thanks for having this call, guys. It's greatly appreciated. On the Card portfolio, have you increased marketing
expenses or developed new programs? It seems like some of your competitors are beginning to go that route.
And also, the corporate card, which I believe is mostly in Asia, is that going to be sold when you sell the
businesses?
And lastly, I think there's about $16 billion of loans in Asia in the Card portfolio. Can I just assume that's all going
to go away when the business is sold?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure, so let me try and take those. So first, we have increased our marketing and acquisition spend as it relates to
Cards as we see the recovery start to take hold, and you can see that referenced in our supplement, which
speaks to that expense very explicitly. We've also kind of looked at and launched, I should say, additional
products. Our cash-back card is out there to attract new customers that kind of respond to those types of rewards,
but we've also kind of continued our efforts around Flex Pay and Flex Loan, which also will generate interest
almost immediately as those balances grow. And so we are actively engaged with acquiring new balances, as I
mentioned earlier.
In terms of the corporate card, which I think was your second question, the corporate card is part of our TTS
platform, which is part of our ICG business. And so as I mentioned earlier, while we're exiting Asia consumer
businesses or markets, we're not exiting any of our ICG business activity in Asia, and that would include our
commercial card activity, which is part of that TTS franchise.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin James Maloney Q
Analyst, BlackRock Advisors LLC
Okay, good. So the $16 billion that's in Asia, some of that will obviously be retained. Is that the takeaway I should
get from that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
So as I mentioned earlier, I gave China as an example. There are Consumer loans of about $3.5 billion that we
have funded there. That would be part of whatever exits we make out of that market, and that would be true for
the consumer balances that we have in the other countries, the other 13 markets that we've referenced. And so
that's kind of as those exits occur over time, we would expect that to move along with it.
