Héctor Grisi Checa
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Begoña. Good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us. Let me just share with you what we
will focus on today. First, I will talk about our Q1 results within the context of the strategy we outlined at our
Investor Day. José will review our financial performance in greater detail, and finally, I will conclude with final
remarks.
Before we start, let me briefly remark that during the first quarter, the financial system has experienced situations
which have confirmed that our strategy and unique business model are key factors that allow us to deliver solid
and resilient results even in times of market volatility, as we have demonstrated today through our first quarter
performance.
As we announced at the Investor Day, we have entered a new phase of shareholder value creation. We are
focused on maximizing value creation, aiming for the first time ever to deliver double-digit growth in tangible net
asset value per share, plus dividend per share with solid capital generation and efficient capital allocation that will
allow us to improve our profitability and provide more returns to our shareholders.
And we will achieve it, thanks to, first, our unique combination of local leadership and our global scale and
network that very few others can replicate. Our business model based on customer focus, scale and
diversification, which provide us growth, cost and profitability, competitive advantages, which is underpinned by
an ambitious transformational plan that is already making Santander a digital bank with branches.
Today, we delivered a solid Q1 with great progress in all our strategic objectives. TNAV + DPS improved 5% in
the quarter. A strong capital generation increased our fully-loaded CET1 ratio to 12.2%, and disciplined capital
allocation improved the percentage of RWAs that create value, and return on tangible equity reached an
extraordinary 14.4%.
In a difficult environment, we are growing customers and volumes. Deposits increased 6% year-on-year, which
drove a double-digit revenue increase with good cost control. At the same time, we have maintained very solid
liquidity ratios as a result of our conservative financial management strategy, and our credit [ph] quality remained
(00:03:13) stable with cost of risk well below our target, in line with a medium/low risk profile of our business.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2023
These trends resulted in a profit of €2.6 billion, the highest in the last five quarters, while profitability improved.
And we also delivered strong capital generation. All in all, we are on track to reach our 2023 targets. I will provide
more details later.
Moving on to the income statement. Firstly, as we usually do, we present growth rates both in euros and constant
euros. There was no material difference this quarter. Secondly, in January, we recorded a €224 million charge
related to extraordinary banking tax on revenue in Spain, €202 million accounted in Spain and €22 million in [ph]
DCB (00:04:05). Excluding this impact, profit rose 10% compared to the same quarter last year, 8% in constant
euros. Additionally, we have positive and negative one-off impacts in Brazil, which do not affect profit. To better
explain the business trends, they have been netted in the other line P&L. José will go in more detail on this,
please.
And thirdly, the most notable movements in the quarter were strong top line performance supported by NII and
higher fees, supported by our global and network businesses. Cost have started the year in line with expectations,
growing 1 point below inflation. We demonstrated the sustainability of our results with double-digit growth in net
operating income, which rose to €8 billion.
From a credit quality perspective, loan loss provisions continued to normalize. José will go into lot of detail on all
of these points later. This is a great start of the year. Good business dynamic start translating into double-digit
revenue growth. We think on increasing year-on-year across our regions and global businesses. We are
implementing our One Transformation project, which is helping those improve the efficiency ratio to within the
range of 44% to 45% that we established for 2023, and which makes us one of the most efficient global banks in
the world.
Our cost of risk remains contained in line with our target of keeping it below 1.2% at the end of the year. Our
RoTE grew quarter-on-quarter to 14.4%; 15.3% if we do not annualize extraordinary banking tax in line to which
our year-end target. And we generated capital equivalent to 17 basis points after having completed the second
share buybacks program to reach a fully-loaded CET1 ratio of 12.2%. In summary, very positive trends which we
expect to consolidate in the coming quarters as we progress towards the 2023 financial targets that we provided
during our 2022 annual results presentation.
As we announced at our Investor Day in February, we are building a digital bank with branches that makes our
customers' lives easier, with processes and products that are simpler and more attractive to them. These,
together with our global network, are helping us to improve the levels of productivity, revenues and cost. This
approach, combined with a disciplined capital allocation, are the cornerstone of our value creation model.
Now, I will dedicate some time to explain how are we progressing. Our customer focus is driving volume and
revenue growth across the group. We are progressing well in the initiatives that will help us to improve the way we
serve our customers and let me explain some of the most relevant ones. We're also taking advantage of our
network effect to better serve our multinational corporates and SMEs through our regional coverage model that is
growing at very high rates. Multi-Latinas and Multi-Europeans are increasing revenue 53% and 72% year-on-year,
respectively.
We're also moving fast in the construction of our branch of the future to offer a best-in-class omnichannel
experience across all the group. A good example of this is significant advances made in the digital onboarding
processes in Mexico. We have a program that aims to better serve our customers through the use of data, which
targets 80% of our customer base. It would help us to personalize our product offering, improving interaction with

our customers and provide them with the best user experience. We have developed a common mobile app across
Europe as a tactical solution, while we implement the common front across all the group, which is already live in
Spain, Portugal and Poland and will be also released in the UK in the end of 2023.
Customer reception has been [ph] stronger demonstrated (00:08:18) in Portugal, where we have improved from
number five to number two by customer satisfaction, that is NPS through the mobile channel since the app was
released. Our efforts to become a fully customer-centric bank are allowing us to grow the number of customers,
loans, deposits and transactions for active customer at a very significant pace, as shown on the right side of the
slide.
But customer focus is not enough. Simplification and automation are also needed, and we are making a good
progress in simplifying our product offering and fully automating our front- and back-end operations. This is
reflected in our leading position in efficiency and significant growth of 10% in net operating income per customer
year-on-year.
As we have discussed, One Transformation is improving our local bank operations. We are bringing our 160
million customers onto a common operating and business model, while converging into a common technology.
We are simplifying our product offering to improve our customer experience and reduce the cost.
We also have already simplified our product catalog by 42% since we started the project two years ago. We are
reducing also administrative and operational task in branches. We aim to optimize around 80% to 90% of the
overall customer-related processes and we are progressing well.
Spain, for example, has already optimized 40% of the processes in scope for 2023 and is expected to provide
significant improvements. We are leveraging our global technology capabilities to accelerate digital transformation
in Europe, to make our processes fully digital end-to-end.
Finally, we are migrating our core banking system to the cloud, a project which we call Gravity, making it more
efficient, modern and scalable. This should result in the annual efficiencies of around €150 million upon full
implementation with a 67% return on investment and a payback of three years.
Overall progress at the group is at 30%. Once we have completed Gravity in Santander UK for our corporates
platform, migrations in CIB and Chile are expected to be concluded before the end of 2023. These are just a few
examples of our ambitious transformation program that will bring Santander's operations to the next level.
Moving to our global and network businesses, the revenue is growing above the group average and already
represents 39% of the group's total revenue. Several actions and initiatives to drive revenue growth are already in
full swing. CIB is still growing strongly after record highs in 2022. We are strengthening the centers of expertise
with value-added products and services, developing global and regional platforms, focusing on our areas of
strength, such as energy, transition, infrastructure, our projects, straight finance, among others.
In the US, we are reinforcing CIB coverage teams, strengthening product capabilities and fully leveraging the
integration of APS to expand our ability to distribute risk assets. Wealth Management and Insurance revenue
grew 43% year-on-year. We are working to maintain the positive trends by scaling up alternative and institutional
products and promoting collaboration between Wealth Management and CIB, offering private banking and asset
management products and services to our CIB clients and vice versa.

In PagoNxt, which is also growing strongly, we have progressed with the migration of Santander Payments in
Spain to our Payments Hub platform and already manages a significant part of the payments in Europe. Merchant
acquiring expanded its innovative value-added services, which is reflected in 27% year-on-year growth in total
payment volumes.
Auto revenue fell, affected by new lending and the performance of our leasing business in SCUSA, as well as the
negative sensitivity to interest rates. We have recently announced an agreement with Stellantis in Europe to
become its key financing partner with, first, to increase the outstanding portfolio by 30% to €40 billion by 2026. At
the same time, we continue to leverage relationships with OEMs, importers and mobility providers to grow our
businesses in North and South America.
We further strengthened our balance sheet and capital position. Our level of risk profile remains medium/low and
is proving to be predictable based on our diversification. Cost of risk stood at 1.05%. Provisions continued to
normalize year-on-year as expected. LLPs performed well in the quarter, as provision dropped 3%, mainly driven
by South America and North America.
At the same time, we delivered strong capital generation. Our CET1 ratio reached 12.2% after having absorbed
the full impacts from the second share buyback program and the extraordinary banking tax in Spain. José will
provide more details in a moment.
We will continue to leverage our transformation plan to deliver increased profitability and shareholder value
creation and profitability. As I mentioned earlier, our RoTE closed at 14.4%, up 100 basis points in the quarter. If
we do not analyze extraordinary banking tax in Spain, RoTE would have been around 15.3%.
Earnings per share grew to €0.15, 11% higher than the 2022 quarterly average, supported by strong profit growth
and lower number of shares following the buyback programs. Additionally, in the quarter, we delivered 5% growth
in shareholder value creation as a result of our disciplined capital allocation and share buybacks.
At current share prices, buybacks continue to be one of the most effective ways to generate value for our
shareholders. We completed last Friday the second 2022 share buyback program, having repurchased around
7% of our outstanding shares in the last two years, which provides a return on investment of approximately 21%
to our shareholders. These results demonstrate that Santander has a strong model and risk management
capabilities that work very well even in the toughest environments.
José will go now into more detail on the group's performance in 2023. Please, José.

Thank you, Héctor, and good morning, everyone. Following our sales presentation, I will go into more detail on
the group's P&L, risk profile and capital performance. Starting with the income statement, I will explain the
account line by line in the following slides, but let me make a few initial comments.
As it has been mentioned, we had some one-off results in the quarter related to the reversal of tax liabilities in
Brazil for €261 million; €211 million in NII and €50 million in tax recovery. And two provisions made to strengthen
the balance sheet totaling €474 million, which net of taxes is €261 million. So, these movements had no impact on
profit and we have decided to net them in the lines of the underlying P&L and ratios to facilitate comparisons with
previous quarters and to better understand the underlying business dynamics to frame them against the year-end
guidelines we gave at the Investor Day.

Additionally, the P&L includes the extraordinary banking tax in Spain, which did have an impact on attributable
profit. On the right-hand side, you can see the upward trend in profit quarter-on-quarter, 23% if we exclude the
banking tax, which was driven by top line growth.
Going into detail on the main lines and starting with the quarterly trends in constant euros, we maintain our strong
revenue improvement. In the first quarter, revenue was 3% higher than in the fourth quarter of 2022, €1.5 billion
higher than in the first quarter of 2022, boosted particularly by NII, which increased €1.2 billion, but also by fees
almost €300 million more.
We have the balance sheet with very positive sensitivity to interest rates, mainly in Europe, which, coupled with
healthy volume growth and an active margin management, led to strong NII improvement in the last few quarters.
Therefore, the first quarter 2023 was a solid quarter despite lower day count and seasonal factors in the
Americas.
We had good fee income growth supported by valued-added products and the network effect. Trading gains, a
small portion of our total revenue, rose driven by customer base CIB transactions. And here it's important to take
into account that 97% of our CIB revenue is customer driven. And finally, other income increased as the fourth
quarter was affected by the deposit guarantee fund contribution. Group NII rose 14% year-on-year, supported by
volumes, interest rate increases and moneys management – margin management as I just said.
In terms of volumes, loans were up year-on-year with double-digit growth in DCB and South America. North
America rose 6% and Europe was stable with falls in Spain and Portugal, mainly driven by prepayments of
mortgages to individuals. Overall loans grew 3% backed by consumer and mortgages.
Likewise, deposits increased 6%, with Europe growing 4% and South America, North America and DCB growing
around 10%. I will go into more detail on our loan and deposit structure later. Interest rate hikes mainly benefited
Europe, Mexico and the Corporate Centre, the latter driven by higher liquidity buffer remuneration.
On the other hand, Brazil was impacted by a change in mix towards lower risk products. And Chile and DCB were
affected by the negative sensitivity to interest rates. Group net interest margin improved from 2.45% to 2.63% as
we continued to actively manage our margins. We are very disciplined managing the cost of deposits and the
repricing of loans. After the market movements at the beginning of the year, our deposit betas are on track with
the numbers provided at the Investor Day. So, we expect this positive NII performance to continue in 2023.
Turning to net fee income, it rose 7% year-on-year, reaching more than €3 billion, which is explained by more
customers and more transactionality with them in retail banking; CIB which stood out with a 16% growth in all
regions but especially in Europe; very positive trends in PagoNxt and cards. And in Wealth Management &
Insurance, we had a good performance in private banking and insurance and volumes in asset management
recovered in the first quarter with a net new money of €1.7 billion.
Finally, in auto, volumes growth across the board continued. However, fee income in Europe was affected by the
new insurance regulation in Germany. The evolution of fees reflects the improvements we make to our model to
be more capital light.
Moving on to costs, the first thing to highlight is that despite inflationary pressures, costs continued to increase
below the rate of inflation. This was the case mainly in Europe, where costs in Spain, the UK and Portugal fell

around 3% to 4% in real terms as salaries in Poland and Latin America tend to be more directly linked to changes
in inflation.
Our efficiency ratio is one of the best in the sector at 44.1%, having improved both year-on-year and quarter-on-
quarter. Outstanding performance in Europe, improving its efficiency ratio by 6 percentage points year-on-year.
We will continue to deliver on our cost and efficiency targets as we expect to further reduce our cost per customer
and, as a result, continue to improve the net operating income per customer as Héctor just explained.
Credit quality remains robust and the cost of risk is well under control. Loan loss provisions grew year-on-year,
driving the cost of risk to converge towards the through-the-cycle average as expected. The main changes by
countries were the following. Improvement in the cost of risk in Spain and Mexico. Credit normalization in the US
from the very low levels we saw in 2021 and in 2022, but the behavior in the first quarter was much better than we
thought. Poland increased its loan loss provisions impacted by higher Swiss franc mortgage provisions. And
finally, in Brazil, we had higher loan loss provisions year-on-year on the back of individual consumer lending, as
well as overall portfolio growth. On a quarterly basis, loan loss provisions fell and the three-month cost of risk in
the quarter was 4.4%.
This performance was supported by the high quality of our portfolio. The non-performing loan ratio continued to
improve, falling to 3.05% from 3.26% in March 2022. The main improvements came in Spain and DCB in part due
to portfolio sales in the period and as well as Mexico. The portfolio distribution by stages remained stable.
On the right-hand side, there is a brief overview of our loan portfolio structure. Around 80% of loans are mostly
concentrated in mature markets. And if we look at the segments, our mortgages have low-average loan-to-values.
The consumer lending portfolio is well-collateralized short term and has high returns. And the SME and corporate
portfolio is well-covered as well as over 50% has guarantees.
Finally, high weight of our corporate investment banking portfolio is investment grade.
Finally, let me comment briefly on our exposure to commercial real estate, which is controlled and diversified
across countries. Our exposure to CRE is 6% of total group's drawn and committed exposure. This is
concentrated in the US, the UK and Spain, accounting for 75% of the total. Over half corresponds to social
housing in the UK and multifamily in the US.
The NPL ratio is 1.6% below the group's total NPL ratio. In the US, we have a total of €21 billion of total drawn
and committed exposure, with an average loan-to-value of between 50% to 60%. Office CRE is just €2 billion and
it has an occupancy rate of 92% compared with around 80% for the sector as a whole.
Let me also go into more detail in Brazil and the US, two countries that have raised some questions in the past
quarters. In Brazil, the Brazilian economy has been performing well in recent years, and interest rate hikes were
implemented promptly and decisively to contain inflation growth in early stages. This environment accelerated the
credit cycle and increased cost of risk in 2022. From now on, we expect interest rates to remain stable and
probably start to come down after the summer.
Additionally, during the last few years, we have been working on improving our portfolio mix in order to structurally
reduce our cost of risk. We have enhanced our customer profile. The weight of new vintages with the best ratings
has increased. We have been more selective in new business to increase our exposure to lower risk secure
portfolios like mortgages, agro or payroll. All in all, given our risk management, the enhanced portfolio mix and

new lending profile, we expect to remain on target. Excluding one-offs in 2023, cost of risk should remain stable
compared to 2022.
Regarding the US, despite the bumpy start of the year in the country, the messages we gave at Investor Day
have not changed. We expect normalization of the cost of risk to continue throughout 2023, but remain below pre-
pandemic levels. We actually had a better start of the year than initially anticipated in terms of credit quality, which
was supported by a stable used car prices and better late-stage delinquency payments. Our focus in auto at the
moment is on quality and profitability over volumes. Moreover, we were able to further increase the share of auto
loans funded by deposits.
We have demonstrated that our conservative structural risk management and solid liquidity place us in a very
strong position to face very challenging scenarios. At the end of the quarter, our liquidity buffer comprising high-
quality liquid assets exceeded €300 billion, 97% of which were level one assets. Two-thirds of this liquidity buffer
is in cash, which is equivalent to 20% of our deposit base.
Our liquidity is strong and stable with ratios well above regulatory requirements. The group LCR remained in line
with year-end at 152% and the NSFR around 120%. The ALCO portfolio represents 6% of total assets, which is
below industry average. The duration of the available-for-sale portfolio is very low and the current mark-to-market
of the whole held-to-collect portfolio would have an impact equivalent to only 2% of our fully-loaded CET1 capital.
This demonstrates that impact from the change of the value for bond portfolio and capital would be very limited
even in a very adverse scenario.
Customer deposits are our primary source of funding and are mainly based on sticky retail deposits in our core
markets. These diversified and stable funding structure supported year-on-year growth as deposits rose with
positive performances across almost all countries and segments. The quarter-on-quarter decline in deposit
balances is explained by the seasonal drop in CIB clients deposits, while retail remained stable in the quarter;
some customers using savings to prepay mortgages given the rising interest rates in Europe.
And we have seen some flows from current accounts, time deposits and mutual funds. We have not seen any
unusual deposit movements in recent weeks following the [ph] troubles with (00:28:43) banks in the US and
Europe. In fact, we actually saw net inflows in the group in deposits in February and March of over €2 billion.
Regarding capital, we ended the quarter at 12.2%. Let me give you some color about the variations in the quarter.
24 basis points of organic growth, which was basically driven by the strong profit generation in the quarter,
partially offset by risk-weighted asset growth. This includes a negative 4-basis-point impact due to the
extraordinary banking tax in Spain, 25 basis points drop from shareholder remuneration, which includes the total
impact of the second 2022 share buyback program, 15 basis points, and the accrual of the cash dividend, 10
basis points, for the first quarter taking into account a 50% payout. 11 basis points were related to the update of
the regulatory framework, mainly following the EBA's clarification of its interpretation of CET1 minority interest
calculation. And finally a positive 7 basis points from markets basically available for sale.
So we have increased our fully-loaded capital ratio while delivering on our capital productivity targets as you can
see on the right-hand side of the slide; improved front book RoRWA to 2.8%, continued asset rotation, and
increase the percentage of risk weighted assets which deliver returns above the cost of equity. All in all, a
disciplined capital allocation which, combined with our model, gives us confidence in the sustainability of our
commitment to remuneration to our shareholders.
Now, I will hand it back to our CEO for the conclusions. Thank you.

Héctor Grisi Checa
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, José. To conclude the presentation and open the Q&A, I will briefly outline some final remarks [ph] of
our vision (00:30:38) for the coming quarters. Growth in customer volumes, robust revenue performance, double-
digit NII growth driven by positive sensitivity to rising rates in most countries and customer margin management.
Fee income grew at high-single-digits, driven by our CIB payments and payment businesses. We expect this
trend to continue in the coming quarters, mainly in Europe and Mexico.
We are implementing our One Transformation plan. Our aim is to serve our customers more efficiently and faster
process automation and simplification, supporting our efficiency improvements. We will accelerate One
Transformation further in the coming quarters. We have already identified business opportunities across the
group, which will enable us to maintain strong global network businesses revenue.
Finally, we have a solid balance sheet in terms of liquidity, solvency and risk profile. We will remain focused on
maintaining a medium low-risk profile and on capital efficiency and asset rotation to ensure a solid capital ratio.
So, as we embark on our new strategy phase, [ph] all this plan (00:31:50) should increase revenue and improve
the efficiency and profitability of our banks with the overall aim of supporting shareholder value creation and
sustainability in profitability.
As previously explained, our outstanding results in the first quarter puts us in an excellent position to meet our
2023 financial targets. However, we may meet them in a slightly different way than initially anticipated, depending
on the evolution of the macro environment. We are convinced that we are going to achieve our 15% RoTE target,
but probably through a higher contribution from Europe and Mexico and a potential lower contribution from the
US.
Finally, we're also optimistic regarding our medium-term targets that we announced at the Investor Day. As I told
our shareholders at the annual general meeting, these targets are specific, ambitious and achievable. We have
the vision of where we want to go and the right strategy together. And we have the best team in place to put it in
motion. So, I am convinced that we will progress quarter-by-quarter to achieve our targets. Thank you very much.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We already have the first question from Ignacio Ulargui from BNP Paribas.
Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Ulargui Q
Analyst, Exane BNP Paribas
Hi. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my questions.
I just have two questions. The first one is on the outlook at group level for NII and fees. If I just look to 1Q, you
have made the guidance provided by the bank in Investor Day and for 2023 of double-digit revenue growth. But,
as the year goes by, I think that that target gets challenged a bit. So wanted just to get a bit of your thoughts on
where should we – particularly on NII, where should the acceleration coming?
And based on the comments that you made at the end, Héctor, a bit of what would be the outlook for the US NII
after the performance of the first quarter? The second one is on cost of risk. Have seen a decline in NPLs in
Brazil, just wanted to be – to get a bit of your thoughts about how should we expect cost of risk evolving from here
in Brazil and whether we have [ph] seen uptick (00:34:30) in NPL or it's just a seasonal effect? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Hello, Ignacio. Thank you very much for your question. Okay. First of all, as I basically discussed, it's quite
important to understand that we will achieve what the numbers that we set at the Investor Day and also our
guidance, given that with the combination that the group is giving you, okay? So, as I basically said, we're going
to be a little lower in Brazil and the US, and we would be much better in Europe and in Mexico, okay? So, it's
quite important to understand exactly the combination and the [ph] work we're (00:35:09) managing the group to
get to the levels that we want, okay?
So, Europe is the one that is going to give us the strongest performance for the full 2023, okay? Mexico should be
up, what we call, low-double-digit, okay? And we expect also, as I said, weaker performance in LatAm with
exception of Mexico, the US and DCB. The US is down mid-single-digits. DCB will be low-single digits decline and
Brazil is basically mid-single-digits growth back-ended. And we expect improvements towards the second half of –
towards the end of the year, okay?
On the cost of risk, I will have José basically give you some ideas.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. So, if I may complement the NII in Europe, we have not seen the full repricing of our portfolio, obviously,
because as you know mortgage is repriced every 12 months. So, we still have a long way to go in the repricing of
mortgages in Spain. Again, they are 12-month Euribor-based and in Portugal is six-month Euribor-based. So, we
still have, again, a way to go to reflect the full impact of the repricing or the rebasing of our portfolio in Europe.
In terms of cost of risk in Brazil, as I said during my presentation, we expect cost of risk to remain fairly flat in
2023 relative to 2022 excluding the one-offs. The cost of risk in the first quarter was 4.4%. The €474 million

provision that we took in Brazil in the first quarter to strengthen the balance sheet was used more or less one-
fourth for one-off cases for specific cases, and the rest it was just to strengthen our balance sheet. So, in that
sense, the 4.4% of the quarter is clean. It excludes one-off cases and it reflects the true asset quality evolution of
the quarter.
So, for the rest of the year, as the interest rates are expected to remain high, we expect a better performance of
our individuals portfolios because these are very short term and, obviously, most of them have matured already
and we have been adding high quality new vintages, but we might expect some more challenging evolution in the
corporate sector. So, again, all in all, excluding one-offs, more or less flat year-on-year.

Operator: Next question from Francisco Riquel from Alantra. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Francisco Riquel Q
Analyst, Alantra Equities Sociedad de Valores SA
Yes. Hello. I wanted to ask about, following the recent turmoil in the sector, I wonder if you, as a management,
have changed anything within the group in terms of liquidity and interest rate risk? And/or if you expect any
regulatory changes in this front in general?
And more specifically, I wonder if you can elaborate a bit more the fall in deposits during the quarter. You
mentioned seasonality in CIB, so you expect to recover those deposits in the coming quarter. And also, if you can
update your guidance in terms of the deposit betas by the end of 2023. You were previously guiding for 25%, 30%
in Spain, 40%, 50% in the UK, above 50% in the US?
And just lastly, last question in terms of the ALCO portfolio in Spain if you have changed your plans. You were
aiming for €16 billion on average in 2023 in terms of size. You are already above, I have seen in the slides. So,
you can also update on this. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Francisco. First of all, let me tell you, given the turmoil and everything, the group is actually
responding quite well, okay? We have seen all the levels in deposits basically maintain themselves. Individuals,
probably, is the most important part in which 85% – 80% to 85% of our deposits are basically individuals, families,
etcetera, which are basically very solid and very stable, okay?
In that regard, also, with all these times, you'll always be prudent about how you manage things, but I can tell you
that our units are performing really well in that sense, okay? In terms of the deposits, it's always cyclical. The
decrease in deposits was mainly in CIB, as we described. It was actually not very meaningful to the total size of
the portfolio, and we expect basically to get them back and it's the normal flow of the business, okay?
In terms of the betas, I will have José give you a little bit of detail on that.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2023
Yeah. So, Paco, in the first quarter, we had a drop of around €21 billion in CIB deposits in Europe, but that was
seasonal. If you look at the fourth quarter, we had quite a strong increase. But, again, this happens every quarter.
This quarter was a bit more – a bit higher than in previous quarters because we also grew a lot in deposits with
our customers in Europe in the fourth quarter, so associated basically with year-end balance sheet performance.
So this is not recurring, and this is seasonal and – but, again, it doesn't really affect the structure of our deposits.
We obviously always try to take advantage of the opportunities. We had an opportunity in the fourth quarter, took
advantage of that, is normalizing a bit in the first quarter, but I would expect this seasonal behavior to happen
every year.
Betas, where are we? So, let me tell you where we are. In Spain, we have a – in retail banking, beta today is 6%
yield. Average yield is 22 basis points. In CIB in Spain, European branches and global CIB, betas are between
80% to 100%. So, in Spain, if you look at the whole of the Spanish balance sheet, the cost is 80 basis points with
a beta of 25%. And this is – we guided for the year to between 25% to 30%, [ph] where still this will hold
(00:42:11), because, again, most of the CIB business has already repriced, and we expect a slow increase in the
repricing of retail banking, so still within the 25% to 30% for the year.
US, beta is 35% at a cost of 1.67%; betas were a bit higher in the first quarter, not significantly higher and very
much in line with the average of the system. In the UK, beta is 25%, and in the first quarter, betas were 30% to
35%, we guided to around 50% for the year. So, if we look at our interest rate sensitivity relative to the figures we
gave at Investor Day, very much in line with Europe and the US, and probably a better outlook in the UK.
Finally, ALCO, yes, we expected more or less €16 billion average in Spain. We are already there. We might be
above – a little bit above that, but it basically depends on the opportunities we see to gradually increase the size
of the portfolio. Remember that we are very, very far from a neutral ALCO portfolio. We have a negative balance
sheet, which is what we want to have. We gradually want to close that negative sensitivity. So, actually, buying an
ALCO portfolio or rebuilding an ALCO portfolio in Spain is not just a matter of 2023, it's probably also a matter of
2024 and even 2025. So, again, we will react to what we see are the market opportunities.

Carlos Joaquim Peixoto Q
Analyst, CaixaBank BPI
Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my call – the question, sorry. So, the first question was
actually the NII and I'm sorry if it's a bit of a recap on previous ones, but I was just wondering if you could give us
again the outlook for NII in both Brazil and the US. And I was also wondering if you could confirm just to make
sure that [indiscernible] (00:44:31) that there is the €210 million one-off positive effect in Brazil NII in the quarter.
And then second question would be actually on fees and, basically, the discussion that we have seen in a
European level regarding [indiscernible] (00:44:52). And I was wondering if you have – if you can give us some
visibility on the potential amount of fees that could be impacted if there were to be an investment ban being
introduced at European level. Thank you very much.

Global Head-Shareholder & Investor Relations, Banco Santander SA
Hi, Carlos. Begoña here. Sorry to do this to you, but you need to repeat all of your questions. The line was
terrible. We couldn't understand a word here. So, can you start again maybe slightly slower and see if it goes
better?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos Joaquim Peixoto Q
Analyst, CaixaBank BPI
So, trying again. Hopefully, you'll help me better. So, as I was saying, on NII, the question was really on the
outlook for the US and Brazil, if you could recap it. And also I was asking to confirm whether there was a €210
million positive one-off in the Brazilian NII just to make sure that I got that number right. And then the second
question was on a potential investment ban in Europe, what type of impact would such ban would have in fee
income for Santander.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. You want me to give you exactly how do we see the NII, okay? It's exactly the guidance that we give is
€211 million, okay? No. Sorry about that. Please.
So Brazil is mid-single-digit growth, okay? We're talking 8.9%. And then the US is 6.1%, it's down mid-single-digit
[ph] drop (00:47:02) – mid-single digits, okay? That's exactly the number.

Sofie Peterzens Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Yeah. Hi. Here is Sofie from JPMorgan. Thanks for taking my question. I know there has been a lot of questions
already on net interest income, but could you kind of give a little bit more detail around when you expect net
interest income to peak in your core European market?
NII was slightly down in the UK. Do you think we've seen peak NII, and net interest income will kind of on a
quarterly basis not improve further. And when do you expect net interest income on a quarterly basis to peak in
Spain and when do you expect it to peak in Portugal?
And my second question would be around the cost of deposits in Mexico. They increased almost 1% quarter-on-
quarter. Could you just detail what drove this increase in cost of deposits in Mexico? And then my final question
would be, on core equity tier 1, you saw 11 basis points of regulatory capital tailwind in the first quarter. How

should we think about any further tailwinds or headwinds on the capital side to come? And could you kind of give
details on the magnitude of any potential headwinds or tailwinds to come? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Sofie. Okay. Really quick. As José was explaining to you in terms of NII what we see in Europe, we're
still not where we believe we're going to be. Mostly, the majority of the portfolio will be reprice in probably April
and May, okay? So the portfolio is still repricing, and we're going to see those impacts mainly in Spain exactly at
that time, probably through the mid – through the cycle of the year and towards the end. This also is going to
depend on what's happening with the deposit impact and how the market is basically going to react towards that.
So, in that sense, we'll see that.
In the UK, we're basically seeing things stable, okay? We basically see that we're still basically building up the
way the portfolio has been going. And also Portugal, we expect also to continue better towards the end of the
year, okay? Also, the terms of what you were talking about, growth in deposits in Mexico, you're right, it's still
lagging behind, okay?
The growth in customers in Mexico is starting to peak. What is important to do in Mexico was actually to change
the onboarding that we had with clients, okay? And that was part of the things that we needed in order to compete
head-to-head against our competitors. So, in that regard, you're going to see an increase on the deposit base in
Mexico in the following quarters given also the new payrolls that we have contracted that are coming into the
portfolio.
Also, you're going to see a very good increase in time deposits as basically the market has turned very
competitive, and we have also been focused on profitability. What we've been doing in Mexico is mainly maintain
our deposit base of individuals while the costly deposits from corporates were basically leaving them aside also to
have much better margins, okay?
In terms of capital, José, would you like to comment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Yes. Yes, Sofie, as you said, we had, the [ph] Q&A from the EBA (00:51:18) was a positive 13 basis points. We
had 2 basis points negative from other updates, model updates and regulatory updates, basically, in corporate
investment banking. We would expect, I don't know, just a few basis points per quarter of negative headwinds
from regulatory models for the rest of the year, very, very small charges per quarter.
In terms of organic capital generation, if you do a simple math in the first quarter, the share buyback corresponds
to two quarters and we had the full impact of the Spanish tax, which was 4 basis points, so the first quarter only
corresponded 1 basis point. So, if you do a, let's say, clean organic capital generation, we generated 10 basis
points, 10 to 12 basis points in the quarter, which is what we have always said, that we organically generate 10 to
15 basis points per quarter, and that's what we expect for the rest of the year.

Operator: Next question from Ignacio Cerezo from UBS. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Cerezo Q
Analyst, UBS AG (London Branch)
Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I've got one in the US and one in Spain. The one in
the US is, if you can elaborate a little bit on the cost of risk drivers in the future, breaking it down between
probability of default loss given default, what kind of measures are you taking to alleviate basically the increased
installments on the auto business in particular for clients that gives you comfort basically that, again, provisions
are not going to go above pre-COVID levels?
And the one in Spain is if you can give us a little bit color in terms of the breakdown of your deposit base between
retail, corporate and large corporate, what kind of behavior are you basically seeing in each of those segments
from a customer point of view, how pushy, especially the retail side actually are being these days in terms of
chasing additional remuneration? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Ignacio. Let me explain exactly what's going on in the US, okay? In terms of cost of risk, we expect
the cost of risk actually to be better than we expected at the beginning. What we saw a little bit in some of the
vintages from 2022 started to being a little bit more complicated than we expected. But it's quite interesting to see
that, normally, when you see customers in those vintages starting to get delinquent for more than 90 days,
usually, we repossess between 90% and 95% of the autos, okay?
What's been happening and it was being quite surprising, is that whenever we see the clients going delinquent
beyond 90 days, we see that they basically are calling us, restructuring and start paying us back. So we have
seen a decrease of repos from around 90% to 95% to around 59% to 60%, okay? That's basically 30 points.
That's why you'll see the cost of risk is getting much better in the US, okay?
To your question, basically of going back to pre-COVID levels, what's going on there is that we have changed the
mix of the portfolio. Pre-COVID, we had a lot more in subprime and deep subprime. Today, we have a much
larger part in the portfolio of prime and near-prime in the business. So that's why the portfolio is never going to go
back to the levels [indiscernible] (00:55:04).
Also, in 2019, we had [ph] Bluestone (00:55:07), okay? If you remember, we actually eliminated that JV back in
2021. That was, basically, very complicated in terms of cost of risk. So that's another part of that. The portfolio is
actually much better because of that, okay? So, in that sense, we believe that the cost of risk in the US, even
though is normalizing because it's going back to pre-COVID levels, is not going to be as that that it used to be, but
is much better than we expected at the beginning, okay? To conclude.
And in terms of the breakdown in deposits, I don't know, José, if you would like to [indiscernible] (00:55:44).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Yes. So, Spain, the – in Spain, the Spanish business, we have €246 billion in deposits; individuals and SMEs is
€229 billion; corporate clients €18 billion. When we look at the public perimeter, that it includes the branches and
CIB, in the branches we have €15 billion and in global corporate investment banking €38 billion, for the total is
what you see in the accounts of €301 billion. Thank you, Ignacio.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos Cobo Catena Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (Spain)
Hi. Thank you for the presentation. Yeah. And just a couple of questions, because most of the doubts have been
cleared. But on the UK, we've seen how cost of deposits also is starting to accelerate. And if you could elaborate
a little bit on the structural hedge and when do you foresee the peak in net interest income because you've said
this year is going to be more of a flattish NII if I understood correctly. Does it mean that we still have to see the
benefits of the structural hedge going forwards in 2024 and 2025, or how do you expect NII to combine
competitive dynamics and the structural hedge upside?
And the second one, if you could just explain a little bit better what caused this change in the EBA criteria to have
that positive impact on capital, just to understand the rationale. Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Okay. I'll take the two of them. Let me answer the second one first which is easy. What basically the EBA has
ruled that minority interest in local currency does not need to be adjusted with the exchange rate, because
obviously if capital is eventually used – let's say Brazil, if capital is eventually used in Brazil, it will be used in
reais, not in euros.
So, before these, the interpretation was that the capital needed to be adjusted through the exchange rate, and
now, obviously, because the capital will be used in local currency, doesn't need to be adjusted. That's a net
between positives in some countries like Brazil and slightly negatives in some countries like Mexico where the
currency has appreciated, net-net 13 basis points.
UK, okay, so in the UK, yeah, we still have around €100 billion structural position, which will help NII going
forward. We would expect mortgages to go down this year more or less around 5%. So, volume's a bit down in
the year, but very positive NII sensitivity to rates, and we still think rates might go up a little bit. So, we would
expect NII to go up mid-single digits, probably it'd be more than mid-single digits. So, that's the expectation for
this year in the UK.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2023
Martha Sanchez Romero Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
Good morning. Thank you very much. My first question is about the NII from your euro balance sheet. The
problem we have is that transfer prices across the different constituents of that balance sheet make it very difficult
to track your NII performance and compare it with your peers. So, you guided at the Capital Markets Day that you
would make €1.7 billion of extra NII in the euro balance sheet this year through that curve at the time. Could you
please update that number today and how it breaks down between Spain, the Corporate Centre, the digital bank,
other Europe and Portugal?
The second question is on the US deposits. That was one of your – expanding your deposit base was one of the
pillars of your plan to improve profitability there. That is now becoming more and more expensive. Where do you
see the cost of deposits in the US by year-end? And what are you doing to differentiate yourselves and being able
to raise deposits without having to pay too much more than your competition? And just a quick one. If you could
update us on the UK on what do you see for mortgage margins, please. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Oh, sorry. I'll take the first one. Martha, I will get back to you with a breakdown. But basically, [ph] solely
(01:01:04) euro balance sheet, it's not that difficult to do the sensitivity. But I will get back to you. The sensitivity
remains the same. Remember, we said, €1.7 billion using the forward rates – forward curve rates as of
December.
In the first quarter, the curves have remained – after having moved up and down, they are basically where they
were at the end of December. So, we would still expect for the next 12 months a sensitivity similar to the one that
we have experienced in the first quarter and in line with that guidance we gave because, as Héctor explained, we
would see the [ph] re-appreciation (01:01:52) of our mortgage books in Spain and in Portugal to gradually gain
speed throughout the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, José, Okay. Let me tell you, Martha, about the US deposits, okay? The US basically accumulated
better, has reached around 35% and the cost is around 1.67%, okay? The high interest rates reflected on the
saving accounts have been showing improvements on the time deposits. So, what can tell you is the majority of
our deposits in the US basically is individuals, okay? That's the bulk of them, okay? And they have proven
themselves very stable. We have really not lose any deposits at all in the individual side.
We have seen a little bit of movements in the mid-corporates, okay, which we are basically diversifying deposits,
but nothing material in that sense, okay? What is important to tell you is that we don't foresee really high
increases on that. I mean, there is a lot of competition in the market. Both our deposit base has been, even with
this situation, maintained itself very stable. So, we don't foresee that we're going to have a huge increase, even
with the competition from some others, players that we have seen in the market, okay? And we are not changing
our assumptions at this time in the way we see the deposits in the US, okay?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
And the final question is UK mortgage margins. Yeah, the margins for that specific business are under pressure.
We would expect slightly weaker margins in the mortgage business going forward. Right now, we have a market

share of 11.3% when we look at stock mortgages in the UK, but when you look at the first quarter, we have
originated, on average, around 6% or 7% of the market because we are focusing only on high-quality mortgages
that obviously have slightly lower margins. But, again, the combination of all our structural position, volume growth
and margin management in the UK should lead to mid- to high-single digits in NII in 2023.

Operator: Next question from Andrea Filtri from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrea Filtri Q
Analyst, Mediobanca SpA (United Kingdom)
Yes. Thank you for taking my questions. I have one question and two quick clarifications. The first is, essentially,
if we take your Q1 numbers and the clean underlying number you provided and we just very basically add up to
the end of the year, we would reach €11 billion profits in 2023, while consensus is well below that. Where do you
see consensus being too conservative on the estimates for 2023?
On the two clarifications, the first is on Brazilian cost of risk. You indicated a flattish evolution excluding one-offs. I
just want to make sure I understood correctly that the €474 million charged on provisions this quarter is not a one-
off and so the guidance you're giving is at 4.4% to 4.5% cost of risk in 2023.
The second is, again, on the guidance you have given before. I didn't understand if it was related to NII growth or
volumes when you said Mexico up double digit, US down mid-single digit and Brazil up low-single digit. Thank
you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Okay. So, let me take consensus and cost of risk in Brazil and I will try to clarify that. With consensus below
where we think we might be, I think we are a bit more constructive on fees and I think the first quarter shows very
good performance of fees basically on the back of the contribution of our global businesses. You've seen in the
presentation that our global businesses, CIB, Wealth Management, PagoNxt, they're doing very, very well.
Also cost of risk, we guided for lower than 1.2% cost of risk. We are at 1.05% in the first quarter, probably the
market is a bit skeptical about our capacity to keep cost of risk under control. So, those, I think, are the two – it is
a bit on NII, but it's not significant and a bit on cost. So, generally, I think it's provisions and fees.
Cost of risk in Brazil. So, the €474 million is not in the P&L and that has been used to reinforce our balance sheet
in Brazil. Around one-fourth of that for one-off cases and the rest is just a generic strengthening of our balance
sheet in Brazil. So, the 4.4% cost of risk in the first quarter is clean in the sense that it doesn't have any one-offs
for specific cases.
From now on, as I said, I would expect if interest rates remain at 13.75% until after the summer, probably we are
going to see cost of risk drifting upwards because of the gradual deterioration of the corporate sector, but by no
means in excess of the cost of risk we had last year. So, that's why we are saying more or less cost of risk in line
with 2022, excluding the one-off which is already excluded in the provisioning number in the first quarter. I think
that clarifies my comments. And then on Mexico?

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2023
Héctor Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. On Mexico, what I can tell you is that you're going to see very good growth in terms of NII, okay, because
of – you are positive in the sensitivity there. Also, what you're going to see is very positive growth in terms of fees
because we are growing clients in a very good way, okay? Mainly credit cards is one of the main drivers. Also,
CIB is an important driver of fees, okay? And also, you're going to see that the cost of risk is actually very much
under control, okay? So, you're going to see an all in all very good performance in the country given that particular
situations and also that the economic situation in the country is doing very well.

Operator: Next question from Britta Schmidt from Autonomous. Please go ahead.

Britta Schmidt Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Yeah. Hi, there. Good morning. I've got a couple of questions on the deposit development in Spain, the decline.
Can you maybe split the trends between corporate and retail deposits there? And also a question, a follow-up
question on the cost of deposits in Spain, there was a quite a meaningful increase Q-on-Q. Do you swap any of
your deposit base? And is that included in the number?
And then lastly, of course, there was also loan yield expansion. Regarding the management of your net interest
income in Spain, do you look more at the customer spread or do you look at the individual costing of the balance
sheet? And then a couple of follow-ups on Brazil. Could you just clarify that last year's cost of risk, excluding one-
off, was around 460, 470 basis points [ph] I think (01:09:43)?
Another question on the Polish FX saga, do you expect there to be more provisions to come for the Polish Swiss
franc mortgages? And lastly, one question on the regulatory outlook. Do you expect there to be any [ph] rethink
(01:10:00) either in Spain or on a global level of deposit insurance charges and the funding of deposit insurance
funds? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Okay. So, deposits in Spain, as I said, €21 billion, €22 billion drop from corporate deposits; flat, slightly down retail
deposits in the quarter. Basically, when you look at early mortgage repayments, they are very much aligned. And
if we look at February and March, as I mentioned, positive trends in both retail and corporate deposits because
again, the €21 billion drop was associated with the year-end balance sheets of our corporate deposits.
I'm not sure I understood your second question well. Your question was if we swap deposits or...

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2023
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
No. We don't. Obviously, no, no. We don't swap the deposits. We manage net interest income – sorry, interest
rate risks through the asset side, not through the liability side. How do we manage NII if I understand correctly?
Do we look at customer margins or how do we manage that? I don't understand well your question. But obviously,
again, interest rate risk management is mostly managed through the asset side. And we look at the overall net
interest margin of our interest earning assets. Brazil, the cost of risk?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Banco Santander SA
Cost of risk is around 4.58% and excluding the one-off that we had, okay? And thus – and in terms of the
mortgages that you asked for Poland, up to now, the portfolio basically is 48% reserved, okay? That's exactly.
And we are actually looking at what we're going to do depending on how the portfolio evolves, okay? But we are
now at 48% coverage of the total portfolio.

Operator: Next question from Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alvaro Serrano Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
Hi. Very quickly, hopefully two questions for me on provisions on the US, I know you touched on an earlier
question on it. But I just wanted to understand the car prices so far have been better [indiscernible] (01:12:34)
year-to-date. And [indiscernible] (01:12:38) data, that's also doing slightly better and the NPLs were down. So,
why didn't – the provisions in a seasonally lower quarter, they didn't go down as much. Is there a lag effect here?
How quickly do second-hand car prices feed into the model, maybe some handholding there? And I don't know if
you can be more specific on your updated views for the full year cost of risk in the US.
And on Brazil, I don't know if you've touched on this, but should we expect any more top-ups or one-offs in Brazil
beyond the recurrent cost of risk that you've already touched on, José? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Banco Santander SA
Alvaro, in the provisions on the US, okay, it's very important that you understand that. I already explained exactly
how the vintages are performing. The other – the previous vintages are basically performing quite well, okay? The
thing is, there are a couple of things. First of all, if you remember with the stimulus, we actually dropped quite a lot
the amount of provisions that we had. What we're having right now is we're having to make some of the
provisions that the portfolio needs to have in order to basically be in the same level that we need to be with IFRS,
okay?
IFRS, as you understand, the new definition of default that was put in place two years ago didn't hit us as much in
the US because the portfolio was performing completely different, okay? So, when you turn that portfolio to IFRS,
the [ph] NOD (01:14:13), the new definition of default basically requires you to create a lot more provisions, even

though you may not need them because the portfolio is performing well beyond 90 days, okay? I don't know if I'm
explaining correctly because it's quite complicated.
So, what I'm trying to tell you, that IFRS does not prevent – I mean sees that the portfolio could be so irregular in
the way it performs, okay? So, normally, a portfolio in Europe beyond 90 days, et cetera, will be – I mean, go for
repossession. A portfolio in the US is not performing exactly like that, it's actually beyond 90 days is performing
much better and the client might pay you one installment, two installments and then would pay you – not to pay
you one installment and then would pay you again, et cetera, okay?
So, that's why you see those difference and the movements in the provisions on the car prices. Even though
you're right, car prices are better than the – are much better than we expected, and the Mannheim is actually at
better levels. At the end, cost of risk in the US is going to be around 2%, okay? It's exactly what we think.
And in terms of – yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
So, let me just – 2% compared with 3% pre-pandemic.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Banco Santander SA
Correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
All right. So, as we were saying, it will gradually normalize, but it is actually performing a little bit better this year
and it will not reach pre-pandemic levels because of the change in the mix that Héctor was referring to. But this
year, we would expect it to be around 2%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. And in terms of Brazil, it's exactly, Alvaro, as José just explained you. Rates in Brazil at around 13.75%,
okay, inflation is actually just below 7%. What José was explaining you, if the rates continue to be that way, there
might be the possibility that some of the big corporates or medium-sized corporates start to suffer, okay? We don't
see that individual portfolio would suffer, because it's shorter term, is managed in a different well, and is a little bit
inelastic to the rates. But the corporate portfolio in the mid-corporates mainly and SMEs could suffer because of
that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
But at the same time, individuals is improving. And you can see that actually in the first quarter, cost of risk
isolated up 4.4% because we are growing in high-quality retail loans and the old vintages are maturing very, very
quickly. So, even with that possible and we don't know, but it may happen, possible deterioration in the cost of risk
in the corporate sector, we would still expect to be in line with the guideline that we gave at Investor Day for a flat
cost of risk year-on-year, excluding one-offs. And, no, the answer is no. We don't expect any significant one-offs
for the rest of the year.

Fernando Gil de Santivanes d´Ornellas Q
Analyst, Bestinver Sociedad de Valores SA
Hi. Thank you very much for taking my question. Just two quick ones on liquidity and LCR ratios. How do you see
the year-end LCR ratios at a group level, Spain, Portugal and the US, please? And can you please remind us of
the TLTRO maturities that the bank has? Thank you very much.
[Multiple Speaker] (01:17:58)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Ah, no, okay. So, no, the LCRs, very difficult to predict, but around 130% to 140% in every unit at least. For the
group, it might be a bit higher than that because of the liquidity of the Corporate Centre. But when we look at
specific units, 130% or above. TLTRO, we have €25 billion left. So, we have repaid €65 billion. This €25 billion will
mature gradually until 2024. The €25 billion, €4 billion in Santander Spain, €18 billion in Santander Consumer
Finance, and €3 billion in Portugal.
