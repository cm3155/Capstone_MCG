Q2 2020 Earnings Call 24-Jul-2020
We will begin today with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, with some remarks about the company's progress
and results. And then Jeff Campbell, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our second
quarter financial performance. After that, we will move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Jeff.
With that, let me turn it over to Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Thanks, Vivian. Hello, everybody, and thanks for joining us on the call this morning. I hope everyone is safe and
well and your families are the same. Let me just jump in.
While overall results for the quarter clearly show the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, Jeff and
I will dive into our performance on a more granular level to give you a clearer picture of what's going on. When we
last got together on April 24, the global economy was basically in a freefall and we had no way of knowing if the
declines we were seeing in our billings would continue. We now realize that mid-April was when we hit the trough
in terms of second quarter spending declines. As we sit here today, there is still much uncertainty about the
economic environment as reopenings have stalled in a number of geographies and the status of government
support programs remains unclear. Nevertheless, I can give you a better sense of where we are and how the
COVID-19 crisis has been affecting us to-date.
Spending volumes overall have been improving gradually since April, and they were down about 40% year-over-
year to a decline of about 20% in mid-July. Non-T&E spending has been recovering at a faster pace than T&E
categories, and our small business customers have been the most resilient through the period. We've not seen an
increase in our total customer attrition levels from prior years. With regards to credit, we feel good about our risk
management capabilities and the progress we've made with the financial relief programs we rolled out to support
our customers as they navigate unexpected financial challenges during these unprecedented times.
We remain confident in our ability to effectively manage credit risk to achieve the best outcomes for both our
customers and our shareholders. All in all, I feel good about how we're managing through this period. Despite the
significant impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic had on our business, we were profitable in the quarter, and we
have a very strong capital and liquidity position and we paid our dividend to our shareholders.
Importantly, our customers continue to be engaged with our products and services and I'm confident that our
strategy of focusing on what we can control in the short-term while continuing to invest in areas that are key to our
growth over the long-term will put us in a position of strength when this crisis ends. Similar to the first quarter, Jeff
will discuss how the current climate is affecting various elements of our financial results, and I'll give a little more
color on what we're doing to manage the company through the present crisis while positioning ourselves to take
advantage of the growth opportunities ahead.
As a reminder, in Q1 we introduced four key priorities for 2020, supporting our colleagues and winning as a team,
protecting our customers and our brand, structuring the company for growth in the future, and staying financially
strong. We made good progress against this framework and we'll continue to use it as a guide through the rest of
the year. I'll go through each of these priorities and give you some highlights of our progress.
In terms of our first priority, supporting our colleagues and winning as a team, we've been operating on a fully-
remote basis globally since mid-March. Our frontline colleagues have continued to deliver outstanding customer
service, and our historically strong customer satisfaction levels have improved globally on a year-over-year basis.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 24-Jul-2020
More recently, like many other global companies, we're taking a slow and cautious approach to returning to our
offices and we're implementing comprehensive safety protocols as our buildings reopen.
I also want to spend a minute talking about the recent incidents of deadly violence against the black community
and the subsequent demands for actions to combat systematic racism. Like many others, we're taking a hard look
at our own practices across our business and developing a comprehensive plan to strengthen diversity and
inclusion within the company while also increasing our support to black-owned businesses and the black
community outside of American Express. As a first step, we made $3 million in grants in 2020 to several non-
profits that support the black community. And as part of our recently-launched Shop Small initiative, we pledged
$10 million over the next four years to fund a coalition with the US Chamber of Commerce Foundation, bringing
together the US black chambers to provide grants to black-owned small businesses. We view this as just the
beginning of a multi-faceted multi-year commitment to do our part to address issues of inequality and to promote
social justice.
Our next priority is protecting our customers and our brand. To ensure our future success, it's critical that we
continue providing a reliable, world-class experience to help our customers manage through these extraordinary
times. In recognition of our customer's evolving needs in this environment, we've enhanced our value propositions
on many of our consumer and small business products including adjusting our rewards programs and added
limited-time offers and statement credits in categories that are relevant for today such as wireless, grocery,
streaming services, business essentials and food delivery. Early results from these enhancements are
encouraging.
As I mentioned, we haven't seen an increase in total customer attrition levels over prior years. In addition, we're
seeing increased Card Member engagement in several of the new categories where we've added value including
streaming and wireless services. We're also building on our commitment to help small businesses around the
world as they struggle to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Last month, we announced our largest-ever
global Shop Small campaign which includes a commitment of over $200 million over the next three months to
help jump-start spending at small merchants in over a dozen countries globally.
Finally, we've had very good results in helping our customers who have required financial assistance during the
pandemic. Nearly three-quarters of those in our short-term pandemic relief programs have successfully exited the
program and are now current and paying their bills. Many of those needing more time have chosen to enter one of
our enhanced longer-term relief programs which provide additional flexibility in paying balances over time. These
longer-term programs are now operating in 20 countries around the world.
Our third priority is to structure the company for growth in the future. COVID-19 has had a major impact on the
way we live and work and some of the changes may last for some time, if not permanently. As we begin to see
what shape the new normal will take, our focus remains on our customers as we look to deepen our relationships
and take advantage of the opportunities that will help us grow our customer base going forward. In our consumer
business, we'll continue to enhance our value propositions to offer features, benefits and experiences that are
particularly relevant to our customer's changing needs. I'm not going to go into specifics now, but you will see us
continue to refresh our current products and launch new ones, focusing on categories that build upon and add to
our traditional T&E offers.
On the commercial side, we're seeing a significant increase in demand for our automated B2B payment solutions
as more customers look for efficient, secure ways to pay suppliers and manage their businesses remotely in this
environment. We continue to introduce a range of new B2B payment solutions for businesses of all sizes such as
last week's launch of American Express One AP for middle-market companies, our first proprietary accounts

payable automation offering which is built on a technology of last year's Acompay acquisition. Going forward, we
expect to see the trend towards digitizing the B2B payments process to continue and we will continue to invest in
these capabilities.
For our merchant partners, we're helping to meet their growing desire, along with consumers, for clean payments
by raising our contactless transaction thresholds in 60 countries around the world. Throughout this period, we're
continuing to look for more ways to embed American Express into our customer's digital lives. To facilitate the
increasing number of online transactions, earlier this month, we announced along with other major payment
networks that we'll begin technical preparations for the international expansion of Click to Pay, a simple and
secure digital checkout solution. We also continue to look for opportunities to extend our mutually beneficial
strategic partnerships such as the renewal of our long-standing relationship with British Airways that was
announced this morning as well as the extension of our agreement with Marriott during the second quarter.
Turning to internal changes, we expect to see an increase in the number of colleagues working from home going
forward which will influence how much real estate we need over the longer -term. In the second quarter, we made
decisions to accelerate the exit of surplus office space in several countries, and we're assessing our long-term
real estate strategy for a post-COVID world. Finally, as I'm sure you all saw, we recently announced that
American Express became the first foreign payments network to be licensed to clear local currency transactions
in Mainland China. This historic milestone is many years in the making and represents an important step forward
in our long-term growth strategy as well as in the overall development of the payments industry in China.
Our fourth priority is to remain financially strong. During the second quarter, we substantially increased our
liquidity to record levels and we further strengthened our capital position with capital ratios that are well above our
targets and regulatory requirements. These robust capital and liquidity levels will enable us to continue operating
through this uncertain period from a position of strength. Looking ahead, no one can tell how the COVID-19
pandemic will evolve or what its impacts will be on the global economy, so we will continue to focus on what we
can control – backing our customers, colleagues and communities; maintaining a tight rein on expenses while
seizing opportunities to invest in initiatives that will enable our long-term growth and remaining very transparent
with all of our key constituents about the trends we're seeing and how they are affecting our business.
That's a quick roundup of the progress we've made on the four priorities I laid out last quarter. These last few
months have been extremely difficult for everyone, and I anticipate we'll continue to face great challenges and
uncertainty in the days ahead. While we can't predict the future, I feel good about how we are managing through
the crisis and I remain confident that we are positioning the company to emerge from this period even stronger.
This is how we weathered crisis time and time again over our 170-year history, focusing on what we can control in
the short-term while positioning our company for the long-term and always believing in our customers, in the
power of our brand and in the resiliency and strength of our people.
I'll now turn it over to Jeff.

Well thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Just like I did last quarter, I'm going to talk you through a
very different set of slides from what we have used historically in order to help you understand how our business
is performing in this unprecedented environment which is obviously unlike any environment any of us have faced
historically. Since the biggest drivers of our financial performance in today's environment are volume and credit
trends, I will spend most of my time in these two areas.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 24-Jul-2020
Let's get right into our summary of financials on slide 3. As you can see, our results this quarter were significantly
impacted by the global pandemic and the resulting containment measures. Second quarter revenues of $7.7
billion were down 28% on an FX-adjusted basis driven by declines in spend, lend and other travel-related
revenues as a result of COVID-19. Net income was $257 million in the quarter. You will notice an unusual
effective tax rate this quarter of 58.7%. This is due to the combination of our lower overall pre-tax income and
some sizable discrete items primarily related to certain foreign deferred tax assets that were impacted by the
current environment. Earnings per share was $0.29 in the second quarter, down 86% from a year ago.
Turning to the details of our performance, I will note that as was the case on our last earnings call, quarterly data
just isn't that helpful given the rapidly-evolving environment, so we'll continue to show you our billed business
performance and certain other metrics with a bit more granularity on monthly and recent trends. Let's begin with
billed business which you see several different views of on slides 4 through 9.
Slide 4 shows you that worldwide billed business declines were the most significant, down around 40% year-over-
year, in the month of April when the US and most of our largest international markets were effectively shut down
due to COVID-19. Since then, we've seen steady improvement in essentially all spending trends. While certain
components of spend are now showing growth, our overall billed business volumes remain down year-over-year
given the significant role that T&E spending has historically played in our business.
In fact, you see on slide 5 that while T&E spending remains down 75% in the first part of July, our non-T&E
billings are actually up about 5% so far in July. This difference between the T&E and non-T&E billings
performance particularly shows when you look at our commercial business where you have the tale of two very
different customer types.
On slide 6, you see that spending from our small- and mid-sized enterprises, or SME customers, has held up
much better through this period than the spending from our large and global corporate card clients. The majority
of the spend from our SME customers is B2B spending. While the spend from our large and global corporate card
clients is predominantly T&E historically, I would also remind you here that spending from our SME customers
represents the majority of our commercial billed business.
You also see the impact of different mixes of T&E spend when you look at our international regions which have a
higher mix of T&E spend and, thus, are showing larger overall declines in volume, as you see on slide 7. Now as
you would expect, we have seen an increasing shift to online and card-not-present spending in the current
environment. This shift is most evident in the consumer business. And you can see on the right-hand side of slide
8 that for the non-T&E categories, consumer online and card-not-present spend is actually up about 25% thus far
in July.
And finally, as we all look for signs of where the most recent trends might take us, you see some impact from
various markets and states going through shifts in the opening of their economies. I would say though that these
impacts tend to be modest, as you see one example of on slide 9 which shows you the latest trends for our four
largest states in the US. More generally, it remains remarkable how much of the world is moving in a fairly similar
pattern. We are just clearly at a point where there's still uncertainty about where that pattern will go next and at
what pace.
Turning next to loans and receivables on slide 10. You see that total loans declined 15% and charge Card
Member receivables declined 36% year-over-year in the second quarter primarily driven by our lower spending
volumes. This dynamic of our balance sheet shrinking in weaker economic times is an important aspect of our
business model, as it fuels the extremely strong liquidity and capital metrics I will discuss later. Looking forward

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 24-Jul-2020
into the third quarter, if you assume some continued modest improvement in spending levels, I'd expect the
sequential trend in our balances to be fairly stable.
Moving on to slide 11, loan and receivable write-offs excluding GCP, these things grew just 8% in the second
quarter and clearly do not yet reflect incremental stress, since not enough time has passed for the impacts of the
current environment to flow through our traditional write-off credit metrics. It is worth noting that our delinquency
dollars are actually down year-over-year. You do see an increase in write-off and delinquency rates year-over-
year, but this is primarily due to the significantly lower loan and receivable balances, as opposed to there being
any significant change yet in these traditional credit metrics.
In contrast, our provision expense on slide 12 reflects the likely impact on future write-offs of the current stressed
environment, as we took an additional credit reserve build of $628 million in the second quarter. As you know,
macroeconomic forecasts are a key factor in determining the credit reserve build under CECL, particularly in a
volatile environment. So, turning then to slide 13, you will see the macroeconomic assumptions that were used in
our CECL reserving models for the first and second quarter.
This quarter, just like last quarter, you had a worsening macro environment. However, this quarter there was an
offsetting benefit mainly from volume declines, as you can see on slide 14. We ended the second quarter with
$6.6 billion of credit reserves, roughly $2.2 billion higher than the reserve level we had on our balance sheet after
we implemented CECL at the beginning of Q1. The increase is from a combination of the $1.7 billion of credit
reserves we added at the end of the first quarter as a result of the worsening economic outlook due to COVID-19
as well as the $628 million reserve build we took in the second quarter.
Today, our lending and charge credit reserves on the balance sheet represent 8% of our loan balances and 1% of
our Card Member receivable balances respectively. So how do we feel about this level of reserves in today's
environment? Based on what we have learned and seen over the last few months, we do feel good about our risk
management practices, the way we are managing risk through the current environment and the resulting level of
reserves we are holding. It all starts with the changes we have made over the last few years in our risk
management practices which gave us a solid starting position. When the pandemic hit, we quickly rolled out a
new short-term customer pandemic relief program or CPR, offering primarily one-month payment deferrals, which
we believe gave us better visibility into our customers' situations and then rolled out enhanced longer-term
programs for customers that need extended assistance as they exit our CPR program.
The nature of our charge card products also gives us very real-time visibility into our customers' situations. And of
course, like others, we are also helped by external factors such as the impact of unprecedented levels of
government stimulus and the broad availability of forbearance programs. Internally, one way we track what is
actually happening in our portfolio is through looking at the balances that are in delinquent status or in one of our
financial relief programs, including the temporary CPR program.
As you can see in the bar on the right-hand side of slide 15, the total of these balances was $5 billion at the end
of Q2, around $2.2 billion higher than the BAU level we had at the end of last year pre-COVID. Around the time
we reported earnings last quarter, this metric was up to a peak of $11.5 billion as we saw balances enrolled in the
customer pandemic relief program peak in mid-April. Since then, the majority of customers exiting the CPR
program have become current and the remainder either enrolled in one of our longer-term financial relief
programs or are in the delinquent bucket. Today, we have stopped enrolling new customers in CPR and only a
relatively small balance remains in the program. You will find the details of our CPM (sic) [CPR] (00:22:51)
program balances in mid-April and at the end of Q2 in the appendix on slide 30.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 24-Jul-2020
The increase in the longer-term financial relief program's balance over the past quarter reflects the effectiveness
of the enhancements we rolled out in April as we continue to work hard alongside our Card Members to help them
identify the right program for them so that they can retain their membership and get to a good financial outcome
for both our customers and our shareholders. Historically, we've seen that the credit outcomes of Card Members
that enroll in our financial relief programs are better than those that do not with around 80% of enrolled balances
successfully completing these payment plans.
And when you look at the delinquent and FRP balances on our books today coupled with our historical experience
with Card Member payment behavior, we believe that the reserves we have on our balance sheet are appropriate
based on what's happened so far. Now only time will tell what the ultimate level of write-offs will be given the
completely unprecedented nature of the global environment, but we feel good about our risk management
capabilities and the work we've done so far to manage our exposure.
Moving on to revenues on slide 16. Revenues declined 28% on an FX-adjusted basis in the second quarter. As
you would expect, given the spend-centric nature of our business model, revenue declines hit a trough with Q2 in
the month of April and showed steady improvement throughout the quarter. Looking at the details of our revenue
performance on slide 17, you see the impact of the continued strong Card Member engagement that Steve
discussed in the 15% growth in net card fees despite declines in all of the revenue lines due to the current
environment. We expect this solid growth to continue with some modest deceleration since we have slowed
proactive new card acquisition.
Other fees and commissions and other revenues were down almost 50% year-over-year due to declines in travel-
related revenue streams such as FX conversion fees, our business travel JV income share and commissions and
fees from our consumer travel business. These revenue streams are a modest part of our total revenue and
typically don't change much quarter-to-quarter in a BAU environment but continue to be down significantly year-
over-year in the second quarter due to the COVID impact on travel.
Turning to the details of net interest income and yield, I would move you ahead to slide 18. On the left-hand side,
you see that net interest yield on our Card Member loans increased 70 basis points year-over-year in the second
quarter driven primarily by mix benefits due to a faster decline in transactor loans relative to revolving loans as
well as our ongoing efforts to effectively price for risk. Moving to the right, net interest income declined 8% on an
FX-adjusted basis which was less than the loan declines we saw in the second quarter due to the yield benefits I
just spoke about.
Our largest component of revenue, discount revenue, declined 38% in the second quarter as you can see on slide
19. As expected, the contraction in discount revenue was larger than the decline in billed business due to the
much larger declines we saw in higher discount rate T&E spend versus lower discount rate non-T&E spend in the
second quarter. The divergence in T&E and non-T&E billing trends drove a 14-basis point decline in the average
discount rate in the second quarter relative to the prior year. Looking forward, if T&E spending remains
suppressed, we would expect a similar level of discount rate erosion in the third quarter.
Moving on to expenses on slide 20. We are continuing to break out our expenses between variable customer
engagement expenses which come down naturally as spend declines and benefits usage changes, and marketing
and OpEx which are driven by management decisions. Variable customer engagement expenses were down 47%
year-over-year driven by lower spend and lower usage of travel-related benefits. The year-over-year decline in
variable customer engagement expenses provided roughly a 60% offset to the revenue decline in the second
quarter, a bit more than I would expect to see going forward.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 24-Jul-2020
Moving on to marketing and OpEx. As we mentioned in our Q1 earnings call, we made the decision back in March
to aggressively reduce costs across the enterprise for the balance of the year but also to reinvest a portion of
those savings in our existing customer base. As a result, we've dramatically reduced our proactive marketing
efforts for new card acquisition and reinvested in value proposition enhancements resulting in a 16% decline in
marketing expenses in the second quarter. This outcome is a good example of what we've long said about the
flexibility we have around our marketing investment levels which can be pulled back as well as redeployed quickly
if market conditions and the universe of attractive opportunities change. Operating expenses were down 7% year-
over-year in the second quarter and we are on track to achieve our target of a $1 billion OpEx reduction year-
over-year cumulatively across Q2 through Q4.
Moving last to capital and liquidity on slide 21. Our capital and liquidity positions remain tremendously strong and
strengthened even further in the second quarter. We also saw healthy deposit growth of 16% during the second
quarter even as we adjusted pricing given the current rate environment as you can see on slide 31 of the
appendix. Due to the countercyclical nature of our balance sheet, our CET1 ratio increased to 13.6% and our
cash and investment balance grew to a record $61.4 billion in the second quarter. We continue to have significant
flexibility to maintain a solid balance sheet in periods of uncertainty or stress. And with our strong capital position,
we have the capacity and intend to continue to pay our dividend in the third quarter. We continue to have
significant flexibility to maintain a strong balance sheet in periods of uncertainty or stress. And our strong capital
position provides the capacity and we will pay our dividend in the third quarter and intend to pay it beyond subject
to our board approval and so long as financial conditions support it.
In summary, no one can know how the future will play out, but we feel good about how we are managing the
company for the long-term. This morning, we have been clear about how the current unprecedented times are
impacting us financially. Looking forward, we have tremendous capital and liquidity strength, the continued
engagement of our customers with our brand, and we're confident that we are focused on the right things to
position American Express to grow as the current challenges inevitably recede.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Vivian.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Go
ahead, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. I'm glad you guys are doing all right and thank you for the added disclosures in the deck;
those were great. I guess, Steve, you pointed out that conditions are a little bit clearer now versus last quarter. So
I'm curious what your views are on T&E and the size of the market and if your views have changed in terms of
there being any structural impact to the market. And then how can we think about American Express responding
to that long-term? Is B2B a realistic solution over the intermediate term? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Good to hear from you, Sanjay. Let me provide a little context first and then sort of answer the question. So when
you look at our overall spending, 70% of our spending before this crisis was non-T&E and growing faster than our
T&E business, and 30% was T&E. To drill down a little bit, our corporate card business was 9% of our overall
business with about 55% to 60% of that being T&E and not growing all that quickly. And then you look at our SME
business which has been the most resilient at this particular point in time, and that business makes up 75% of our
commercial business overall and is doing quite well, and probably close to 80% of that spend is non-T&E.
So when we look at what's going on right now, and we gave you obviously disclosure up till almost sort of mid-
July, we see growth in non-T&E but we see T&E as still being slow. We're seeing restaurants come back
obviously faster than you see airlines or hotels coming back. But I also think what you're seeing is there's an
unbelievable demand for people to travel. It may not be the same types of travel, but you are seeing people
driving to different locations, and albeit when they come back quarantining, but they are driving to different
locations. And so we're seeing obviously a little bit of an uptick in some of our lodging which would include Airbnb
as well and other entities like that. But I think as we think about this longer-term, and you only have to look at
what the airline executives said over the last week or so, I think my view has not changed on corporate travel. I
think corporate travel will take a while to come back, but eventually we'll get back to 2019 levels; you just won't
have all that growth that was happening in between.
I think the demand for consumer travel once consumers feel safe again, you will have this unbelievable pent-up
demand for people to want to get out and travel. In fact, our co-brand cards in our consumer business are actually
performing better than some of our proprietary cards. Now that may seem counterintuitive, but when you look at
our partnerships with Delta, Hilton, BA and so forth, these cards are performing better. Why are they performing
better? Well, they're performing better because 90% of the spending is not on the co-brand partner. 90% of the
spending – these are not store cards; these are all-purpose cards. And a lot of people, their psychology is they
save points for the big trip. The other part of the psychology is I want status and I can get status through
spending. And I think when this is over, status is going to be even more important as we move forward.
So I don't think from a timing perspective my view has changed. I think that will be driven by therapeutics, it'll be
driven by vaccine, it'll be driven by the distribution and production of vaccines. But I think that as we look at our
spending, we anticipate a slow climb back. And we're seeing our consumers – by definition, consumers consume
and there is a pent-up demand to consume and they will find other ways to consume, as we are seeing.

From a value proposition perspective, because I'm sure that's where people will go next, from a value proposition
perspective, part of our DNA has always been to constantly refresh our value propositions. And as we've talked
about, we've been talking about refreshing those value propositions from a lifestyle perspective. And so, while not
getting into specific details on value propositions for competitive reasons, what we've done in the short-term is
some stopgap measures in terms of various credits and extension of benefits and things like that which are doing
two things. Number one, showing our customers we're thinking about them, but number two is actually getting
more engagements in categories that we didn't have as much engagement in. We increased our engagement in
wireless and we increased our engagement in streaming.
But you will see us continue to morph our value propositions into next year by adding on to our premium value
propositions with more lifestyle non-T&E aspects and developing other value propositions for other products and
services. So I hope I gave you sort of a general view of how we're thinking about things.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I just wanted to understand a little bit on the credit side and the reserving that you did. I know you indicated that
you feel like you're in a good place. And so, when I think about the reserving levels, I'm looking at the $6.6 billion
versus roughly the $5 billion in the delinquency and financial relief programs that you've got. So is that how I
should be thinking about the forward look? As these financial relief programs either increase or decrease, the
reserve will flex around that? And maybe you can give us a sense as to how you're seeing those reserve buckets
between consumer and small business, because there's been a lot of questions around the small business
exposure and risk that you've got. Thank you.

Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Executive Vice President-Finance, Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. Two good questions, Betsy. I guess the numbers I would actually encourage people to think about are
since the beginning of the crisis between last quarter and this quarter, we've added $2.2 billion, $2.3 billion of

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 24-Jul-2020
reserves. And of course, that is based upon CECL accounting, which is really about a forecast of the future. And
that forecast of the future, I would tell you, well, we don't do our own economic forecasts. The external provider
that we use does incorporate into their forecast such things as government aid running out, such things as
perhaps more small business failures and/or layoffs. So, that all goes into that $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion CECL
reserve build as a forecast.
The reason we added slide 15, which is something we really closely monitor internally, Betsy, is because it's fact.
It's not a forecast; it shows you the actual experience that we have had through the end of June. And the number I
would actually encourage you to look at on slide 15 is the difference between the total dollars we had that were
delinquent or in a financial relief program before COVID-19. The difference between that number and the end of
July was $2.2 billion. And very importantly, I pointed it out in my script, our historical experience is that with
people we get into one of our longer financial relief programs, we generally over time are able to manage to get
about 80% of those balances. So we look at these numbers and say, boy, we feel good about our credit reserves;
we think they're certainly appropriate. I would point out, depending on what your future view is of the economy,
Betsy, if you think there's going to be several more shocks, government aid running out, then we will need all
those reserves. On the other hand, I think what slide 15 would say, if those shocks don't occur, we may not need
all those reserves. We'll have to see.
The last thing I'd say is, if you go back 90 days, this is to your second part of your question, Betsy, initially there
were a higher percentage of the dollars that were in the small business receivable and loan receivable balances
that signed up for CPR than there were consumer. 90 days on now, we actually feel really good about the small
business portfolio and, in fact, those numbers have come way down. And I think it's important to remember – and
Steve, you might want to talk for a second about this – I think people sometimes forget, they look at our small
business segment and they think, oh my gosh, that's restaurants and some of the harder-hit sectors; that's not
actually who our small business Card Members are.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. So, just the other point of that question is there's – in that FRP program, as Jeff said, historically 80% wind
up paying us. And when they do that now, they'll get their membership back and what have you. But out of that,
there's more consumer in FRP right now than there is in small business. But I think what's really important about
small business, you've got to look at the merchant business and you've got to look at the small business card
business. They're two completely different businesses. And while we have a huge preponderance of the
restaurants across the world, and particularly in the United States, from a merchant acceptance perspective only
3% of our small business customers are actually restaurants. The concentration of our small business portfolio is
professional services, legal, finance, insurance, real estate about 14%; construction about 10% and healthcare
about 5%.
So when you think about small businesses, there's a wide variety of small businesses and I think we tend to think
about small businesses as the restaurant and the local retail shop. We don't tend to think about small businesses
from a professional perspective. And there's a lot of people getting a lot of things done in their homes because
they're not going anywhere at this particular point in time. So we're seeing good activity in those segments. So I
think that's an important distinction between what our merchant base looks like and what our small business card
base looks like.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 24-Jul-2020
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to – Jeff, I share your comments on the discount fees
remaining strong at least here in the near-term. But your proprietary cards-in-force did decline for the first time in
quite a while. So I was curious. Is that just driven by slower acquisitions? And if you could maybe just provide
some more color on just what you're seeing in terms of attrition trends and what you're doing to drive retention in
this current backdrop. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Executive Vice President-Finance, Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, so maybe a couple of points. First, I'd just remind everyone the context here is that for a couple years, the
fastest-growing part of our revenue line by far has been net card fees. We feel really good about the level of Card
Member engagements that that represents. And even this quarter, in the face of all the challenges, that line grew
15%; that's point one. Point two, as Steve pointed out, when you look at our overall attrition levels, they have not
gone up at all and are flat to down to where they were a year ago which we think is a really strong statement
about the continued engagement of our Card Members.
What we did do is that we slowed our proactive acquisition because there's just not enough visibility into the
actual credit quality of applicants. So you saw our new cards acquired which is also disclosed in parts of the press
tables were down significantly year-over-year. The other thing you would expect us to be doing from a risk
management perspective is we have been very diligent about looking at people who are inactive Card Members
and canceling those cards. You don't want to have inactive cards sitting out there in the middle of a economic
downturn. So really, that combination of slower new Card Member acquisition along with some of the inactive
cancellations that we're doing are why when you look at that total card number you see the numbers you do. But
we feel really good about our attrition levels, we feel really good about our Card Member and I'd expect to see net
card fees continue to grow in the double digits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. I mean, the most important thing, so if you look at exactly the number you looked at, that's what you see.
The most important thing for me in looking at the business is voluntary attrition, and voluntary attrition levels are
down year-over-year. And from an acquisition perspective, you don't want to be the spender or borrower here of
last resort. And so we have been very, very circumspect about how we keep the channels going and what have
you and who we take in and who we don't take in. But what we've done is we've kept our channels open because
you've got to keep those channels open because you want to be able to turn them on at the appropriate time.
There will be a pent-up demand and I don't want to have to sort of regen all the channels that we have.
But the thing that I look at on a weekly basis, and we look at this by card level and card type but I'm not going to
get into it with you, but the reality is in managing the business I look at voluntary attrition, and that is down. And of
course, in a situation like we're in now where over time we've been feeding the card acquisition machine, you
don't feed it to the same extent that we've been feeding it. And so it is down significantly which is why you're
seeing the marketing expense go down, which is why you've seen us pivot our marketing investment from card
acquisition to Card Member value and Card Member engagement. So I'm not concerned at all about the
proprietary card numbers. Those numbers will come back up as we turn acquisition back on, but what I do watch
very carefully is the voluntary attrition numbers. And Jeff's point is right. I mean, we will cancel people because
you do not want contingent liability out there in the environment. If they hadn't been using you before, more than
likely you don't want them to be using you now.

Operator: We'll go next to Chris Donat with Piper Sandler. Go ahead, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Donat Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to ask about the impact of bankruptcies on your financial
statements. We've seen some corporate issuers and they'll identify American Express as a creditor. And we did
see in the variance analysis in the presentation that you had a $53 million write-off for receivables for a corporate
client. So, Jeff, can you just remind us sort of how those flow like in terms of recoveries? Do they show up in
different places in the income statement and how do they typically play out?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Executive Vice President-Finance, Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. So, Chris, the kinds of losses you're mostly referring to which are when a merchant goes out of business in
a situation where either the merchant owes us money or we're going to make good on certain Card Members who
didn't get their goods or services delivered, those are generally not going to appear as part of the credit provision;
they're generally going to appear in OpEx. Historically, that number has been completely insignificant. We've
taken some modest, I guess, in the tens of millions of dollars charges the last two quarters. We manage it very
closely. The one larger number you talked about if you – and very quick reading on your part – to get to the
variance explanation, you would also note that due to a little bit of a quirk in accounting, yes, we had a $53 million
loss with an international merchant. On the other hand, that's actually a merchant where we had some credit
insurance, so we would expect to more or less fully recover that loss. It appears on a different line item in the
P&L, so that's all carefully footnoted there in the appendix. So, look, we work closely with all of our merchants, we
watch this very carefully, but historically these just aren't big numbers for us.

Operator: We'll go next to the line of Craig (sic) [Eric] (00:48:45) Wasserstrom with UBS. Go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric Wasserstrom Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Thank you. It's Eric Wasserstrom. One question. Steve, it was interesting of course to see the renewal with –
that you announced today. Generally speaking, as you're approaching these co-brand renewals, how and to what
extent are the current trends influencing how these deals are being struck, if at all differently from the past?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. So, look, we've done – in the quarter we did a renewal and an extension. We extended our Marriott
agreement early in the quarter and today we announced the renewal to 2028 of British Airways, so let me just
give you the context on how I think about these things. If I was thinking about these renewals for a 12 to 24-month
period, I wouldn't do them. But I'm thinking about this business for the long-term. And in the long-term, these have
been terrific partners. British Airways has been a terrific partner of ours for over 20 years. Marriott has been a
partner of ours as they did the Starwood acquisition. We had Starwood for a number of years and we're very
happy about that relationship.
And the reality is is that this pandemic will end. And as I mentioned earlier, when I look at the Delta and I look at
the Hilton card, these are cards that are actually performing even better than some of our proprietary cards. And
the reason for that is you have two great brands together with great value propositions. So as we think about
these renewals, we think about them over the long-term; we don't think about them just at a short-term period.

And you see that in both of these renewals. There were upfront purchases of points and that's, in a way for us, to
help out our partners but also to help out our shareholders as well. So these are, again, long-term partnerships
that have tremendous value and we look at them over the life of these deals. And over the life of these deals,
these would be good things for our shareholders and good things for our customers. And so that's why we
extended both of these deals at this particular point in time.

Operator: Our next question will come from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Go ahead, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Mark Togut Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Thank you. Good morning. Steve, you've highlighted the surge for more kind of cardholder value in your
comments, and we've seen from most of the card-issuing banks the second quarter reports and even in the Visa
and Mastercard intra-quarter updates the strength in debit. And I'm wondering whether this isn't a time for
American Express to introduce a debit card to the extent we're in a multi-year search for value here, a tough
economy. Doesn't that play to the consumer value proposition that could be with us for a while?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
It's something that we look at on an ongoing basis. Economics are a little bit different in debit and the value that
you're able to put on a debit card given the economics are a little bit different. But we continue to look at ways to
fully service our customers not only from a lending perspective but a transaction spending perspective as well. So
it's something that we'll continue to look at, and if in fact we believe it will add more value then we will look to
proceed. It was part of why we did our deal with PayPal to link Venmo in. We felt that while we didn't need our
own debit product, the ability to have the transfer from Venmo to American Express and vice versa was good.
And, look, as we launch China, that will be both a debit and a credit market for us. So it's something that we
constantly look at, and as you can see there'll be two sort of flavors of that while not having our own-issued debit
card at this particular point in time.

Operator: Our next question will be from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominick Gabriele Q
Director & Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Thanks so much for taking my questions. As you guys look at your billed business growth numbers versus the
peer data, I think some of the spend growth trends reflect the prudence of your customer base to dial back
perhaps some of their discretionary spending. Can you just talk about some of the green shoots, if any, as to
where your customer base has been diverting their spending from travel to other categories and how that
spending behavior may have changed on a temporary basis versus more permanent? Thanks so much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. Look, I think that our spending base has been traditionally from a consumer perspective more high-end
consumer, more discretionary spending, more luxury spending. Over the last couple of months, it's been hard to
do that. It has been hard to take those trips, it has been hard to even go shopping for luxury goods. We've seen
more online spending. Obviously, people are eating out less and they're buying more groceries and what have
you, but we believe there is a pent-up demand within our consumer base to spend. I think what you're also seeing

is lots of spending from our perspective in sort of home improvement area with people like Lowe's and Home
Depot and things like that where our Card Members are spending.
The other piece of our overall spending really is as you think about our corporate spending. Our corporate
spending is down by 50%, and that's traditionally the T&E piece. The B2B piece is still relatively strong. So I think
while we look at it, we haven't really seen our consumers really break out a lot of their spending at this point
which, from my perspective, is not necessarily a bad thing because, number one, it gives us more opportunity sort
of down the road and we're more than holding our own obviously from a financial perspective both credit and
profitability and from a card value perspective with what they're doing. But I think time will tell if there are
permanent shifts in spending. But I think that, as I said before, our consumers like to consume and they will find
other ways to spend and they'll find ways to get more luxury goods and things like that.

Operator: We'll go to the line of Mark DeVries from Barclays. Go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark C. DeVries Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks. And sorry if you covered this in the prepared comments, but normally Card Member rewards kind
of move with billed business, but this quarter it was down a lot more. Was that a product of just lower spend in
T&E which has higher rewards attachment or is there something you did actively there to manage that expense?
And also, if revenues remain weak for a prolonged period of time, are there other things you're looking to do to
lower expenses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Executive Vice President-Finance, Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. So actually, Mark, you're sort of dead-on. Normally, people should expect rewards to move roughly in line
with billings. This quarter it went down more and that was driven by the fact that, you're correct, the higher cost
redemptions are the redemptions that people do for travel-related rewards. One of the shifts just like spend, as
Steve was just talking about, has shifted a little bit from travel into other types of spending. Well, we still have
rewards shifted from the higher-cost travel to other things, particularly some of the online things we do with some
of our partners. And so that's why for this quarter, you saw rewards come down a little faster than just the billings.
I don't know that I'd – I think that trend may have played itself out. We'll have to see.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
The other thing that we did about a year ago is we did a deal with PayPal to be able to burn points at every
PayPal merchant in the United States. And so we were starting to see PayPal kick up and it was all about
providing our Card Members with more and more options for rewards. And so, again, is that a permanent trend?
No, but I think we were starting to see that. So I think we'll have a little bit more balance and redemption going
forward as well.

Craig Maurer Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Great. Thank you. I wanted to go back to Sanjay's comment and ask that you retain these disclosures after the
pandemic, but just a suggestion. I wanted to ask if you're seeing any – I'm trying to think through what retailers
are doing now in response to what's going on. This seems like this might be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for
retailers to disintermediate their highest cost cards, meaning travel-based rewards programs, and try to
permanently push a narrative away from that. How are you thinking about that? How are you reacting to that? And
are you hearing any discussions of that from executives? And then just a numbers question for Jeff. Jeff, what
was the reserve coverage in the SME portfolio? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. So Craig, I haven't heard any of that. I think right now, retailers, restaurants and anybody else is trying to
welcome people with open arms. Now is not the time to be aggravating your customers in any way, shape or
form. And I think when customers are coming in to establishments, they go there with the intent to not only
support the establishment but to have a good time, and I'm not so sure they really want to be badgered or
suppressed or anything else. I don't see that, I have not seen that, I haven't heard that, I haven't heard that from
other card executives and I certainly haven't seen that within our own portfolios.
The other thing I would say is that I'm not seeing a big push on store cards right now either, which is probably not
the most creditworthy segment, so I haven't seen it. But, Craig, we're always looking for that and that's why we're
always trying to deliver value on both sides of the equation by driving in high-spending customers. And I just think
at this time, it's fool-hearted for a merchant to sort of give their customer any reason to not want to come back to
the store. So, haven't seen it at all.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Executive Vice President-Finance, Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
And, Craig, in response to your second question. As I said in my remarks, overall, you had 8% of our Card
Member loan balances reserved and about a little more than 1% on the Card Member receivable side and clearly
reflecting something else I said earlier. One of the things that has pleased us in the last 90 days is that when you
look at the reserve percentage on the loan side, which is where most of the exposure is, it's actually lower for
SME; it's at 7% than it is for consumer which is a little bit above 8%.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Executive Vice President-Finance, Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
90 days ago, to be honest, it was not clear to us that's where the trend was going to go, but that makes us feel
pretty good. On the receivable side, on both the SME and consumer side, it's around 1%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. Just one other point on that. There was early on coming out of the pandemic, you saw a group of
merchants that were adding on sort of, regardless of how you paid it, anywhere from a 3% to 5% COVID
surcharge; they were actually calling it a COVID surcharge. They got ripped in the press and they got ripped by
their customers. If your costs are going up, raise your costs, but don't surprise somebody at the end. So I think
people right now are just happy with people coming in to their store albeit what that means coming in to a store
these days, whether you're eating out in the street or you sort of drive by, pickup for shopping. So I just don't see
that happening in the short- to medium-term.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks. So, Jeff, in terms of the state disclosure and you think about consumer T&E, how impactful is sort of your
top one or two markets, New York or California, if we see one of those open up or slow down, just to get a
sensitivity of what that could do to T&E?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Executive Vice President-Finance, Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, so you're correct. The states we chose to show in the slides are our four largest states, Texas, Florida, New
York and California. I don't think we've given the exact numbers, Don, in a while by state. I'd kind of step way
back. Remember, we're a global company. The US is only two-thirds of the business to begin with. And of course,
we are spread across all 50 states so no one state opening or closing at various levels is going to have a material
impact on our trends. The other point I will come back to, Don, that I do think is not completely intuitive to people
is when you look at the varying rates states have opened up, there's a little bit of difference between states. If you
look at that chart, there's New York. New York is still down a little bit more than in Texas or Florida but it's a pretty
modest difference. So the most important thing is more where is the overall global economy going, at what rate do
we make some real medical strides here, and our business will respond.
