Thank you, Carmen. Welcome and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us on today's call as we
review our fourth quarter and full-year 2020 results. Our earnings release and investor presentation are available
at columbiabank.com.
Amidst the turmoil in 2020 caused by the pandemic, social unrest, turbulent financial markets, and contentious
election cycle, Columbia achieved another record year. Pre-tax, pre-provision income of over $270 million was
our best year yet, eclipsing the record set just last year by $25 million. The pandemic drove our provision expense
for credit losses to an all-time high, yet full-year net income and EPS were still very strong at $154 million and
$2.17, respectively.
During last quarter's call, we mentioned that our pipelines were rebuilding. Our bankers' business development
activities during the quarter exceeded expectations, delivering a record $468 million of loan origination with

deposit [ph] size (00:02:08) to a new high of $13.9 billion. We were very proud of the resiliency, adaptability, and
dedication our employees [indiscernible] (00:02:17) in 2020. Our business activities continued in a near-normal
capacity, with bankers winning new client relationships and completing important operational initiatives that
immediately improved our operating leverage. They accomplished so much more than simply remaining open for
business during COVID.
On the call with me today are Aaron Deer, our Chief Financial Officer; Chris Merrywell, our Chief Operating
Officer; and Andy McDonald, our Chief Credit Officer. We'll be happy to answer your questions following our
prepared remarks. I need to remind you that we may make forward-looking statements during the call. For further
information on forward-looking comments, please refer to either our earnings release, our website, or our SEC
filings.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Aaron to review our financial performance.

Aaron James Deer
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Clint. 2020 earnings of $154 million and EPS of $2.17 were materially influenced by the economic
impact of the pandemic on our net interest margin and credit loss provision. The steep decline in interest rates at
the end of the first quarter was offset by a higher volume of lower yielding earnings from PPP loans and
investment securities, both [indiscernible] (00:03:35) during the year. Interest income was further supported by the
interest rate collar implemented at the beginning of 2019. Expenses were carefully managed to $345 million,
which was the lowest level since 2017, the year of the Pacific Continental acquisition.
Fourth quarter earnings of $58.3 million and EPS of $0.82 were an increase of $13.6 million and $0.19,
respectively, on a linked quarter basis. Quarterly pre-tax, pre-provision earnings increased $8.3 million to $70.4
million with the rise driven mostly by a combination of accelerated loan fees from the payoff of PPP loans and a
recapture of credit loss provisions. But there were other favorable operating trends in the quarter that contributed
to the upside and helped to offset continued pressure on core asset yields.
Total deposits ended the quarter at $13.9 billion, up $270 million from September 30, and $3.2 billion over the
past year. The quarterly increase was most of the interest-bearing demand was spread throughout our footprint.
The annual increase was attributed to federal stimulus, including PPP loans, as well as reduced spending and
higher savings by both retail and commercial clients. Our cost of deposits declined to 1 basis point during the
quarter to 5 basis points, which was down 21 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in
deposits created additional liquidity, and we moved a significant amount of our excess cash into investment
securities during the quarter, but we're being mindful of potential deposit outflows heading into 2021.
As a result of these investments, our securities portfolio increased $928 million to $5.2 billion. Despite this
considerable growth, the composition and duration of the portfolio did not change materially. The investment
securities yields climbed just 1 basis point to 2.21%, where I should note the fourth quarter yield benefited from –
in the early repayments on two Fannie Mae CMBS funds. Without these one-time payments, yield would have
been 2%.
The net interest margin improved 5 basis points on a linked quarter basis to 3.52%. The increase stemmed from
the acceleration of $4.9 million of PPP loan fees due to paydowns or forgiveness by the SBA. This added 14
basis points to the margin. On a standalone basis, the PPP portfolio yield was 4.46% and benefited the margin by
5 basis points. In addition, the bank had a $1.7 million recovery of interest on a nonaccrual loan that paid off,
adding 5 basis points, as well as the two early payoffs of investment securities I just mentioned that contributed

$2.5 million of interest income, or 7 basis points to the margin. For the year, the net interest margin decreased 59
basis points through decreases in loan and investment yield of 69 bps and 28 bps, respectively, as well as greater
liquidity on the balance sheet. PPP loans only contributed 2 basis points of the decline, as accelerated fee
recognition offset [ph] the low 1% (00:06:41) interest rate.
Total loans ended the quarter at $9.4 billion, down $261 million from September 30, driven by $302 million of
payoffs in the PPP portfolio. Excluding PPP loans, balances rose $40 million to $8.8 billion. New loan production
has brought on an average tax adjusted coupon rate of 3.36%, which compared to the overall portfolio, excluding
PPP loans, of 4.05%. Noninterest income increased $1.1 million in a linked quarter basis to $23.6 million, due
largely to higher mortgage banking revenues stemming from strong volumes, improved sale execution, and a
one-time benefit of roughly $1 million from a change in our sale methodology. Noninterest expense decreased to
$815,000 on a linked quarter basis to $84.3 million, largely due to a $1.3 million recapture of provision for
unfunded loan commitments.
Our noninterest expense ratio declined to 2.05% for the quarter, and our operating efficiency ratio decreased 3
points to 53%. We expect our quarterly noninterest expense run rate to be in the mid to upper 80s in 2021. The
provision for income taxes increased $6.8 million on a linked quarter basis to $16.8 million, representing a 22.3%
effective rate, which was elevated given the higher level of taxable income in the final quarter of the year and the
true-up of our full-year effective rate to 19.8%. We expect our 2021 tax rate to be in the range of 19% to 21%.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris.

Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. As Clint noted, fourth quarter loan production of $468 million
was a new quarterly record, propelling full-year production, excluding PPP loans, to $1.4 billion. Total loans
declined from $9.7 billion to $9.4 billion, mostly due to the payoff of PPP loans. Line utilization remained stable
during the quarter at 46.6%. When compared to the end of 2019, total loans increased by $684 million, primarily
due to open PPP loans of $662 million as of the end of 2020.
During a year of unprecedented challenges, our bankers' focus on relationships with our clients resulted in loan
levels consistent with those before the pandemic. This is a win, and credit goes to everyone throughout the
company for pulling together to move our clients' businesses forward in a time of significant need. Excluding the
impact of the PPP portfolio, loans grew by $40 million during the quarter. Growth was centered in the C&I and
CRE portfolios, which increased $64 million and $35 million, respectively, during the quarter. Record production in
both portfolios was offset by payoffs and continued low line utilization, CRE growth in warehouse and retail
segments, and C&I growth in rental and leasing and public administration segments were offset by declines in
agricultural loans. Mortgage loans increased by $46 million, mostly due to the purchase of a $50 million portfolio
at the end of the quarter.
Residential mortgage activity continued at an accelerated pace during the fourth quarter, driving noninterest [ph]
loan revenue higher by (00:10:15) $1.3 million on a linked quarter basis. The quarterly production mix was 55%
fixed, 41% floating, and 3% variable. The overall portfolio of mix now stands at 7% PPP loans, 48% non-PPP
fixed rate loans, 32% floating rate, and 13% variable. PPP loans were $652 million at the end of the year, with
over $300 million of payoffs and paydowns since the forgiveness portal opened in mid-August. If that wasn't
enough, we've opened our new portal for round two of the program on January 19, and once again experienced a
large volume of applications. Our bankers and back office teams are actively working with our clients to ensure
that loans are funded as quickly as possible, and we are seeing great results.

Deposits grew by $270 million during the quarter, and $3.2 billion during the year, to end the year at $13.9 billion
as Aaron mentioned. The deposit mix shifted from 62% business and 38% consumer as of September 30, back to
our typical 60%/40% business/consumer split at December 31. The decline in business deposits was attributed to
our normal seasonality. From a product perspective, deposits as of December 31 were evenly split between
noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing.
As part of our brand strategy, we completed the consolidation of two branches during the quarter, and we
continue to evaluate our distribution system as we move forward.
And now I will turn the call over to Andy to review our credit performance.

Thanks, Chris. This quarter's ACL totaled $149.1 million, reflecting a $7.8 million from the third quarter comprised
of net charge-offs totaling $3.1 million and a provision release of $4.7 million. The lower required allowance was
the result of an improved economic outlook, offset by management adjustments for COVID-related exposure in
the commercial real estate segments of the portfolio, specifically restaurants, office, retail, and hotels.
Consistent with my comments last quarter, the momentum and path of the recovery will continue to be threatened
by the coronavirus pandemic. While downside risk has narrowed, numerous risks still remain, such as the fourfold
increase in COVID cases throughout Q4, the slow rollout of the vaccine, [ph] faster decline in (00:13:09) GDP
over November and December, and continuing localized lockdowns in our footprint. Our model assumes
annualized gross domestic product to decline in the first quarter of 2021 by 2.8% before rebounding and ending
2021 with a fourth quarter increase of 3.2%. The unemployment rate is predicted to end 2021 at 6.6%. As a
reminder, we use IHS Markit for our economic forecasts.
As I noted previously, we continue to [ph] apply over latest (00:13:52) quarter of what we consider high-risk
commercial real estate and downstream potential impacts of permanent job losses at a significant Northwest
employer. These amounted to a combined $11 million in Q4, an increase from $5 million in Q3. Much of this
thought process is driven by the lockdowns which occurred during the fourth quarter in our footprint. We ended
the quarter with an allowance relative to period-end loans of 1.58%. Adjusting for the PPP loans, the allowance to
period-end loans increases to 1.7%.
NPAs for the quarter were relatively unchanged at 21 basis points. However, as you know, I like to adjust for PPP
loans, and I agree this provides a more consistent comparison as we move forward. With this adjustment, NPAs
do not increase but decline by 2 basis points, so again, relatively unchanged.
Past due loans for the quarter were 28 basis points, compared to 15 basis points last quarter. And net charge-offs
were annualized at 13 basis points for the quarter versus 8 basis points last quarter. Our impaired capital ratio
improved modestly from 25.3% to 23%, thanks to a decline in substandard assets. In summary, while our credit
metrics improved for the quarter, I would still characterize them as stable.
On the risk-rating front, loans rated watch or worse declined $129 million during the quarter. We saw watch loans
decline $57 million, going from $393 million to $336 million. Special mention loans declined $57 million to $297
million, and substandard loans saw a decline of $15 million. At year-end, we had approximately $321 million in
substandard loans. These changes decreased our watch and below-risk ratings from 11.1% to 10.1% of total
loans. Again, very stable metrics.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
Okay. Deferrals. At the close of the quarter, we had $147 million in active deferrals or roughly 1.7% of our
portfolio, excluding PPP loans. This is up modestly from $114 million deferrals at the end of the third quarter. I
would note that about 23% of these loans are criticized, classified assets.
The deferral bucket is comprised of $50 million in clients with first deferrals and $97 million of clients with second
deferrals. Approximately 45% or $44 million of the second deferrals are related to an Oregon State deferral
program. Unique to our footprint and others doing business in Oregon, there's a statute that allows borrowers with
loans secured by real estate in Oregon to obtain a deferral simply because they have real estate domiciled in
Oregon. This statute expired December 31, so these borrowers will begin making payments again this month
unless the Oregon legislature amends and extends the statute.
Most of the deferrals continue to be in the hospitality portfolio, which accounts for $39 million of the active
deferrals. As mentioned before, this is consistent with our strategy relative to the sector and does not cause us to
be any more concerned than when we entered the pandemic. The remaining balance of the deferrals are really
spread out across a wide variety of businesses. The foreclosed, identified back in April of 2020 as being some of
the first to be impacted by the pandemic, which includes our dental, retail, hotel, healthcare, restaurants, and
aviation portfolios, amounted to about $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2020, or roughly 24% of our loan portfolio.
If we exclude the dental and healthcare portfolios, this number drops to $1.2 billion, or 13% of our portfolio, as of
December 31, 2020. The largest portfolio we identified again was our dental portfolio. As previously discussed
throughout 2020, we believe the impact on this portfolio to be truly transitory. When we look at the credit metrics
for this portfolio, that story varies out.
Past loans represent 97% of the portfolio. Special mention and substandard loans actually declined in the fourth
quarter. We have only one loan on deferral for $715,000. Past dues are only 1 basis points and nonaccruals are 2
basis points. We will likely be removing the pandemic-impacted portfolio for our 2021 reporting.
The next largest segment we identified as having high risk relative to the economic disruption caused by COVID-
19 is our retail portfolio. We have approximately $512 million in retail-related exposure, excluding PPP loans. It's
comprised of commercial real estate and commercial business loans, and represents about 6% of our total loan
portfolio. The largest part of our retail exposure comprises commercial real estate loans, which account for
approximately $452 million of the total, or roughly 88%. Again, to give you an idea of the types of retail properties
we finance, the most common are small four-to five-bay strip centers located in suburban communities and
standalone single-tenant properties. In addition, the portfolio contains grocery-anchored centers and mixed-use
properties. We are not in large downtown core metropolitan areas nor do we finance regional malls or big box
retailers.
For the entire retail portfolio, 95% is [ph] tax-rated (20:32), of which 5% is watch, which we also categorize as a
[ph] tax (20:36) category. It is a slight improvement over last quarter and continues a positive trend. While this
trend is encouraging, we remain cautious given government-mandated COVID closures and government-
mandated deferrals.
Okay. Deferrals in this segment are up slightly from the third quarter from 1% to about 1.3%, with half on their first
deferral and the other half on their second deferral. However, it is still a significant improvement from earlier in the
year than deferrals accounted for 16.4% of the portfolio. Using add origination values, the average loan-to-value
for the portfolio is 50%, with 98% of the portfolio having loan-to-value less than 75%. We have stress-tested this
portfolio for an equivalent decline in value as seen during the Great Recession. The average loan to value rises to
63%, with about 76% of the properties having a loan-to-value less than 75%. Obviously, we were pleased with

how this portfolio is performing, but we remain cautious, and our expectation is that we will see weakening in this
portfolio throughout 2021.
Let's discuss hotels next. We have $327 million in hotel loans, representing about 3.5% of our loan portfolio.
Again, to give you an idea on the type of hotels we financed, most have one of the following flags: Holiday Inn,
Best Western, Choice, Marriott, and Wyndham. In total, flagged properties comprise 77% percent of the portfolio.
The average loan size is $1.5 million. Today, we have $39 million on deferral, which is down from last quarter
when approximately $62 million was on deferral. However, $31 million of the $39 million is on its second deferral.
For us, this is not surprising as we are executing on longer-term strategies. We do expect deferrals will continue
to decline in this category.
For the fourth quarter, we actually saw some healing in this portfolio. Loans rated special mention and
substandard declined from $180 million to $145 million as the leisure travel properties performed well in 2020. It
appears that since folks do not go to Hawaii, Puerto Rico or Europe, they chose to go to the Pacific Coast,
national parks in Idaho and Oregon, as well as other recreation areas [indiscernible] (23:37). Similar to the retail
and commercial real estate portfolio, we continue to do stress testing on this portfolio as well. The average loan-
to-value for the portfolio based on originated appraised value is 54%, with 97% of the portfolio having a loan-to-
value less than 75%. On a stress basis, about 55% of the portfolio has a loan-to-value less than 75%.
Let's move on to the non-dental healthcare portfolio, which is about $254 million in total, excluding PPP loans.
Similar to the dental portfolio, we saw the impact of the pandemic here to be transitory. Problem loans have
remained steady at around 1.4% of the portfolio for the last three quarters, and this is down from 2.1% at year-
end 2019. Past dues are consistent at 10 basis points, and payment deferrals have declined from $107 million to
$250,000, which really only represents one client.
Next up is restaurants and food services. This, of course, is a portfolio that has been very impacted by
government actions attempting to control the COVID-19 pandemic. After having been forced to close in the spring
of 2020 and then again in the late fall and early winter of 2020, we anticipate further weakening in this portfolio
throughout 2021.
We have approximately $173 million in this portfolio – booked in this portfolio, excluding PPP loans, with two-
thirds comprising commercial real estate loans. Today, 82% is watch or better, down from 86% at the end of the
third quarter. Thus, watch and worse loans increased $5 million to $35 million. In absolute terms, not big
numbers, but directionally it demonstrates the effects of governmental action. We granted 157 deferrals for about
$66 million in this portfolio. Today, we have 12 payment deferrals for about $8 million. Last quarter, this portfolio
add $16 million in deferrals.
Similar to the hotel and retail segments, we see this area taking some time to heal, and we are not surprised by
the negative migration. Certainly, the current round of PPP funding will greatly benefit this segment. We do stress
testing again on this portion of the portfolio; and on a pre-pandemic basis, the average loan-to-value is 58%, with
94% having a loan-to-value less than 75%, again, on a pre-pandemic basis. Under our stress test scenario,
average loan-to-value rises to 73%, with only 55% having a loan-to-value less than 75%.
The last portfolio I'm going to discuss is our aviation portfolio. Now, it's comprised of both direct exposure to
domestic airline carriers, as well as entities that lease airplanes and engines to airline carriers. In total, the
portfolio was about $140 million, with about $96 million being direct exposure to US domestic airlines, and the
remaining $44 million exposure to lessors.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
Today, most of the portfolio is rated watch, which is consistent with last quarter. Given the longer duration for
recovery in this segment, risk ratings are highly dependent on borrowers' liquidity and run rate or, as we call it,
burn rate positions.
Of the domestic airlines we have exposure to, they have raised over $53 billion in additional capital to assist them
through this pandemic. As such, this additional capital, combined with expense reduction efforts, results on our
borrowers having between 18 to 35 months of burn rate. This is not including $6.5 billion more that was recently
announced in additional payroll support agreements with the US Treasury Department. Based on the current burn
rate, the airlines with the majority of our exposure have sufficient liquidity to get them into the fourth quarter of
2022. Most of the domestic airline exposure is secured by aircraft, with a free stress loan-to-value of 69% and a
current loan-to-value really closer to 74%. However, on a stress test basis, our loan-to-value rises to 89%.
As for the leasing portfolio, which again is only $44 million, 50% of the exposure is in Asia, 26% in Europe, and
8% in South America. The rest is in North America and the Middle East. The majority of the portfolio consists of
narrow body aircraft with an average age of 8.7 years. We view the younger, more fuel-efficient aircraft as the
most in demand post-pandemic. Based on origination values, our average loan-to-value for this portfolio is 74%
and are based on what we believe to be today's value probably closer to 78%. And on a stress basis, it rises to
91%.
Similar to the domestic airlines, many of the lessors have been able to access the bond market and securitize
unencumbered assets to bolster their liquidity positions. We estimate our lessors to have raised over $3 billion in
liquidity as now through the third quarter. So, while the climb back to profitability and, more importantly, positive
cash flow for this industry will be protracted, it continues to attract the necessary capital to bridge them to a return
to profitability, which we do not anticipate until 2023 at the earliest.
Okay. With that, I'll turn the call back to Clint.

Thank you, Andy. Despite the challenges of 2020, we remained focused on supporting our communities
throughout the year. We extended our community impact by tailoring our efforts to meet the unique challenges of
the year, combining fundraising, company contributions, and important dividend, generated nearly [ph] $4 million
(30:20) in economic support across our footprint. This is a testament to our employees' dedication to the
communities where they live and work.
I'm particularly proud of the $315,000 they've raised for Walmart's winner drive during the holiday season. Nearly
$1.5 million have been raised to support more than 60 shelters over the [indiscernible] (30:44) six-year history.
Our teams also supported community through a Pass It On program where we saved more than 350 small
businesses over $600,000 to provide [indiscernible] (30:57) for someone in the community who was impacted by
COVID-19 or the economic downturn.
This is just a few examples of the ways our team expressed their dedication to our communities in 2020. I'm
proud of their continued support and the commitment they demonstrated in the midst of a very challenging year.
Lastly, we announced our regular quarterly dividend of $0.28 this morning. This quarter's dividend, we'll be paying
on February 24 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 10.

...check back in on the – just the expenses, and I got Aaron's sort of guide of mid-upper 80s run rate, but just kind
of thinking about the mix of that and catching up to where you sit on kind of investment versus management of
expenses and just kind of the intricacies. I know that it's an ongoing investment, but just trying to get to where –
anything new you're launching or what the spend you've had in years past. Just trying to catch up with that
dynamic. Thanks.

That kind of touches several areas. I'll let Aaron get into the detail of it, and then as appropriate, Chris might jump
in. But just to start with, one of the things, and I think you caged your question in this fashion, is that we've never
stopped investing in our business and in the future of our franchise, and that investment can be in from additional
technology, can be reopened in the quarter or our newest NeighborHub in Boise, that's an investment at
community.
Also, there's a fair amount of disruption that occurred across the – across our three-state footprint, and it's with
some of the large national banks that are consolidating operations amid COVID, and remote work has been a
dynamic that has caused folks to maybe reconsider the companies that they work for. And we continue to remain
an employer of choice broadly across our markets. And so we've had the opportunity to look at new teams.
So, as those opportunities present themselves, we'll continue to take a long-term view and make the investments
that we think will drive additional returns down the road for our shareholders. And so, now, I'll step back and let
Aaron add his details.

Yeah. Jeff, as you saw in the press release, we did have the $1.3 million recovery book provision from side
commitments in the fourth quarter. So, that's obviously something to keep in mind when you're thinking about
where the run rate guidance is for next year. In addition, there's always kind of normal year-end true-ups, a variety
kind of ins and outs on that front. One of the largest of those, we had a $700,000 reversal of a medical accrual in
the fourth quarter, so that obviously won't carry into the first.
And then, as you know, you always kind of have some higher approach generally in the comp side, [indiscernible]
(35:33) cost, those sorts of things headed into the New Year [indiscernible] (35:35). Also just as a year-over-year
reference, we called it in the early part of 2020, we recognized $2.2 million in credit for FDIC assessments. Those
benefits have obviously gone away.
And then as the year goes on, we're hoping that [indiscernible] (35:55) our bankers are excited to get back out in
front of clients and off of Zoom calls. And so we could see some increase in travel [indiscernible] (36:04) costs
and that sort of thing. As Clint said, always investing in new personnel and new technology is just kind of an
ongoing part of our business. And I don't know if Chris has anything to add in terms of kind of special items on
that front.

Christopher M. Merrywell A
Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
No, probably just more – Jeff, you've followed us for a long time and know that we have a pretty consistent
methodical process around our branch system and other parts of the network. And we've been knocking down
square footage for years, for decades. And we'll continue to look at that. We'll continue to do it. There's a piece
now that's been brought into play with all of the consolidations in the industry, or the closures. We're looking at
that from an opportunistic standpoint. And what does that mean? We're seeing business that we're able to pick
up. So, there's a revenue play on the side too from these branch consolidations, especially on more of the world
communities and things of that nature. So, again, we'll look at that. We'll look for opportunities, but I wouldn't see
us changing from our current direction of consistency, if you will, on that.
As far as people, there's certainly disruption in the industry when mass consolidations are announced and things
like that, it creates anxious employees, and we're an employer of choice, as Clint mentioned. And so we'll
continue to look at the – where those folks come available. And if the investment makes sense and the
opportunity is there, we'll certainly continue down that path. But it's been a very disciplined approach over the
history of the bank, and I don't see that changing.

Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Appreciate it. That's good coverage. One last one, just maybe for Clint. It's been a while on the acquisition front
and some of that certainly by design but also perhaps by the market. Any update on your appetite within that?
And my guess is it's more stored – steered towards lift-outs and other, but maybe give us an update of where
you're – how you're thinking about acquisition going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. It's still very much a part of our DNA. When we look at the individuals that have been part of our acquisition
and integration teams over the last 10 or 12 years, I'd say that we've had some folks that have retired. But I'd say
that a lot of our key leaders and those types of activities, probably 80% to 85% of them are still with us. So, it's
definitely a skill set that we still possess. We spend a lot of time modernizing our platforms and things over the

last few years, and really started looking towards what the M&A market might hold about this time last year, and
then COVID hit and kind of shut everything down. I'd just say that our history of being active in M&A is still part of
the part of our strategy. And you know what, I think that there's just nothing specific, but I just think in general with
– and there's some pent-up demand, and I think there's an increased sense of urgency relative to the rate
environment and need to improve operating leverage and grow revenue. And so I think that that's going to
accelerate as we get further beyond the pandemic. And our goal is always to at least be part of the conversation.
So, when somebody reaches the point where they're ready to find a partner, our goal is always to at least have
them pick up the phone and give us a call. So, I don't know if that's helpful, but that's kind of how we do it.

Jon Arfstrom Q

Yes. That means I get to ask 20 questions, by the way. I mean, the queue is light behind me, so I'll start. But
anyway, maybe Andy, a question for you. Appreciate all the commentary on the stressed portfolios. If you had to
consolidate all of that, are you more optimistic/ less pessimistic or do you still have things that keep you awake at
night? It feels like things are better and it kind of looks like that from your economic factors in your reserving, but
give us a big picture of your consolidated thoughts on that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew L. McDonald A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. So, I think, obviously, the general healthcare portfolios played out like we thought, and so we feel very
good about those. The hotel portfolio has performed exceptionally well, I would say. And I think that has to do with
the fact that we have more leisure-related hotel exposure than we do business travel, and I alluded that in my
comments.

And then, yeah, I have to be pretty happy with the rest of the portfolio. But the two that I continue to be concerned
with, and I think this is consistent, is restaurant and retail, and that really has to do with the government closures
and our footprint. And many of those are small businesses. And I think it will have a very detriment – so many of
them got closed early in the year. They got closed at the end of last year, and they remain closed now, or if
they're open, it's very limited, 25% of what they could do prior to. So, those two segments are the ones that I
continue to have, I guess, more focus on and concerned than the other segments which I think is performing quite
well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, okay. The path on – maybe this is a Aaron, Andy question, but the path to get back to maybe where the
reserve was as a percentage of loans earlier in the year, is that just a natural evolution of the economy lending
and things getting more comfortable?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew L. McDonald A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, honestly under the CECL model, we emphasized a large amount of reserves in the first half of
2020. And as I have discussed earlier, our provision, I think, was really relatively unchanged. As we go throughout
2021, I don't see a whole like any really big changes in that other than I see net charge-offs materializing in the
latter half of the year and into 2022, and that will bleed down the reserve. We won't necessarily have to replenish
that if the economy continues to move in a positive direction. And so, to your point, yes, it will be a natural
evolution of how the reserve works.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, okay. Good. Aaron, maybe one for you. You put a little bit of cash to work this quarter in securities and I
think I understand that. But talk to us a little bit about what you expect on the margin, some of the puts and takes
on the core margin. I think, with your new loan yields, you're suggesting continued modest pressure, but maybe
with some of these loan growth production numbers the potential to outrun that. So, maybe kind of walk us
through what we should think about in terms of how we model it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Sure. So, Jon, we – so, we reported a 3.52% margin for the fourth quarter. The PPP impacted that in the quarter,
all in, including both the interest earned on those, the normal amortization amounts, and the accelerated
amortization of fees is included in that 5-basis point benefit. We also had 5-basis point benefit from the interest
recovery that we had on a nonaccrual loan of $1.7 million. And then there's two CMBS pre-pays that added about
7 basis points. So, you can kind of take out all that, I guess get some measure of maybe where the core will be,
though I wouldn't say that it's not entirely uncommon to have some pre-pay benefits on the portfolio just given that
we do have a number of portfolios that kind of match those characteristics.
But as you noted, going forward, the rate where new production is coming down relative to the portfolio will be
detrimental to the margin. In the third quarter, excluding all the kind of PPP noise, the rates on the loan portfolio
was 4.15%; in the fourth quarter, that dropped down to 4.05%. New production coupons are around 3.40%. So,
it's – there's going to be a continued headwind there.

Similarly, on the securities portfolio, excluding the benefit of those pre-pays, the yield on that broker spread at 2%,
just as in the portfolio when we had a very busy quarter on that front, as you noted, with having brought about
$1.1 billion in new securities. The yields on that was 1.26%. So, again, it's going to – in a continued way and
things going forward, so long as we continue to remain in this extremely low rate environment, hopefully we have
seen a little bit of lift in the [ph] tenure (47:37) recently, and hopefully that sticks and continues to build, and
hopefully the – ultimately we get higher rates on the short end as well if we continue to progress through the
economic recovery as expected. But we're not counting on any benefit from that any time soon. But I think we
kind of take where the new stuffs is coming on and, yeah, that should give you a sense of the kind of pressure
that will probably likely continue to see through here, notwithstanding all the additional noise that we're going to
see from PPP.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, good morning, everyone. On the new money yields at – on the loan side at $340 million, I guess I'm a little
surprised at how low they are. Is that just a mixed issue this quarter where we might see a little bit higher rate
going forward or is that just kind of the new – that's where the competition is?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Matt, this is Chris, and you're kind of sad there at the end tells me that we're all kind of thinking the same
way maybe. A lot of it is the competitive environment, the massive amounts of liquidity are out there, the
challenges of when you find good credit is – it's extremely competitive. And so, we steer away consistently from
anything that involves structures that we're uncomfortable with, terms that we're uncomfortable with, but we're
going to have to compete on rates sometimes in that. And so, some of it also is the mix, you bring on some large
deals during the quarter, those come on at a little lower rate generally. And going forward, I would anticipate that
we're probably looking at this for a while, and it's going to take a little sorting out as competitors are entering or
maybe pulling back from the market based on how their portfolios perform. But I would expect that the competition
continues, especially for high-quality credit deals.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q

Okay, makes sense. And then on the – as it relates to the disruption in your markets, are you at the point where

Yeah. Have you already identified teams at this stage? And if so, are you looking for a certain type of specialty
lenders, or is it just your general commercial banker with seasoned books of business?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Sure. It's always in process, and we go with the philosophy of we're recruiting all the time, and you never know
when somebody is going to be ready to make that move. And so, if we know the individuals, we know the markets
that they're in, we've got a good idea of their books and what they do, then we'll be opportunistic when the time is
right.
Now, there – and we've got special fees and things of that nature that is certainly to the core of how we operate,
and if we can locate somebody, they are interested in joining us and they bring a new niche, we're absolutely
interested in that. If it's somebody that fits into an existing niche that we knew we've been competing against, we
know them, we respect them, we [ph] know about (00:51:44) quality bankers, we'll add them into that piece. Some
of our markets were pretty widespread between metropolitan areas and rural areas. As you get farther away from
the metropolitan areas, you tend to get more generalists. And some of them however do [ph] have specialties
(00:52:03). And so, it's kind of a long way around, and we're open to any and all, and we're constantly looking.

Hi, Jacque.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jacquelynne Bohlen Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I was just curious on the driver of the loan purchase this quarter. Was that driven by – looking to [ph] some of the
runoff (00:52:57), or was it just an attractive portfolio that came across your desk?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Kind of both. It's more of we have a portfolio of mortgage, and it's – a fair bit of that obviously is paying down
given how rates are, so it was a little bit of refilling of that, but – and I would just highlight that we're also producing
a great deal, and what we're producing doesn't always necessarily match what we want to hold on our own
balance sheet. So, the amount that we've purchased is certainly far below what we actually produced and sold
during the quarter. I don't know if Chris has anything to add to that, but...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jacquelynne Bohlen Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. So just balancing kind of overall competition within that portfolio with the driver?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A

Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jacquelynne Bohlen Q

Okay. And then touching back on the M&A topic, I'm just wondering if you could provide us a refresher with what
you're looking for in terms of a partner in terms of maybe how small or how big you might be looking to go, and
also if Northern California still remains of interest to you?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. It's – we say it's got to be a cultural fit, and we've said that [indiscernible] (00:54:23) one of our criteria. We
start with the balance sheet and look at their business model, because if it's a very different business model than
what we have, it's probably going to culturally be very hard to bring the two organizations together. There's – the
sizing is a bit of a moving target, if you will, because I think it depends on if it's a bank that has a really good niche
that is additive to what we do, it could be on the smaller side, and that would give – it'd be something that maybe
we could look at and build upon.
An example [indiscernible] (00:55:22) from a size standpoint that Pacific Continental fit into this, but Pacific
Continental has a national healthcare platform. That's very complementary we felt at the time, and three years
later, it's proven itself out that it's very complementary to what we were doing in the healthcare front in our existing
market. So if there's a bank that's on the smaller side that has something like that, that would be [indiscernible]
(00:55:54) fill-in, and there are some fill-in opportunities within our existing footprints that might cause us to look
towards the smaller side of it.

There's obviously ones where you have a lot of market overlap and it gets better operating leverage and – but
those are going to typically be on the larger end of it. And then as it relates to all of those things, if it provides
entry into a new market, that's also something that we would evaluate and has to be that cultural fit first and
foremost, but then what else does it bring to us, entry into a new market, it's something we'd take a very close
look at. And specific to Northern California, we've been studying that market for several years now. We like that –
what we've learned about the market. It's very similar in a lot of ways to [indiscernible] (00:57:09), and even as
you get into the more metro areas of not necessarily San Francisco proper, but in and around the Bay Area and
those markets, they're pretty similar to Portland, Seattle. So, this is something that we think is still of interest. And
we continue to just learn more as much as we can about the market and who the quality bankers are in that
market.

please.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, everybody. It's great to see the acceleration in originations in the quarter. I'm just curious where
you're seeing growth, is it from existing clients that are continuing to invest? Is it new clients from the PPP
program or the new [indiscernible] (00:58:18) or even the neighborhood concept? And just kind of the pulse of
your clients as we entered 2021, do you kind of get the sense that they're ready to invest in expansion CapEx and
we could see accelerating growth throughout the year, or your client is still a bit cautious given the uncertainty?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, David, this is Chris. I can tell you, I think it's a mix in there. [ph] They look at (00:58:44) some of our
markets and they haven't had governmental closures and things of that nature, so they're operating much
different. The originations are purely across the footprint. Those are in companies that didn't experience a
downturn or things of that nature. They are being opportunistic as you said, and they're looking to make
investments. Now some of it's purchasing their own building, things of that nature, but I'd tell you it's a mix
between current clients and new. Now, we were one of the institutions [ph] did (00:59:24) in the first round of
PPP, we did not [ph] extend it (00:59:28) as a marketing tool and we didn't take on non-clients in that manner.
However, we are seeing people coming to us after the fact and things that we are winning during the fourth
quarter has come from just our bankers' efforts and their continued effort to stay in front of prospects.
We brought on some other investment types of things that are ultimately turning into opportunities, which has
been good to see. As you start looking towards the year, I think it's a little bit of a mix there, too. You've got – if
you look at the second round of PPP and what the requirements were to enter that, there's a lot of companies out
there that are doing [ph] very well and are not eligible (01:00:18) to reapply. They're going to have different

opportunities to seek out investments or whatever it may be for their business, then those that are reapplying [ph]
this go around (01:00:29) that really need that stimulus and that support, so we'll have to see how this next round
really plays itself out.
I think the story really is the momentum that we had talked about building, we saw a lot of it hit in the fourth
quarter. I'm typically always cautiously optimistic that we can continue that, a lot of our bankers, a lot of our back
office [ph] loan ops (01:00:57), things of that nature. Our sleeves are rolled up and working extremely hard right
now on the second round, and that's a distraction. But again, there is also new business that's out there at the
same time, so we're really balancing that out and trying to keep the momentum from the fourth quarter going. But
there is a bit of a distraction, and that's going to continue for a little bit here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And then just on the fee income front, the countercyclicality of some of these business lines has been a
huge help in a challenging environment. Just curious how you think about fee income, is there [ph] any other
initiative (01:01:36) that you'd be interested in expanding into, whether organically or through M&A? And just how
you think about fee income and potentially expanding that fee income contribution?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. This is Aaron. I'll start just because I do want to highlight that during the quarter, we had [indiscernible]
(01:01:58) that there was almost $800,000 fair value adjustment on the mortgage loan pipeline. So just that
[indiscernible] (01:02:06) volatility, but – and I don't mean to take away from the tremendous activity that we've
had in mortgage, because that team has just been doing a fantastic job. But beyond that, I'll turn it over to Chris to
add anything else on the [ph] seafront (01:02:21).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, I think there's – are we looking for other areas, that's always something that's under consideration. We've
explored a lot of things, haven't found anything that's truly a fit that goes to – doesn't change who we are, who
we've been. And with that said, we have [ph] CD financial (01:02:41), we have our trust group, and those teams
continue to grow and improve.
2020 was off to a tremendous start, and then the pandemic hit, and a little bit of a dip in the middle there, but they
closed the year strong. And what we're seeing in that business is a real demand for people to participate in
financial planning and look at possibly business sales and things of that nature as we start to come out of this. So,
optimistic in that area, the mortgage group continues to do a great job as [ph] was (01:03:23) mentioned. It's a
little bit more rate contingent. As rates start to rise, that'll certainly change the refinance aspect of that. But to
date, it hasn't – that hasn't happened and they continue to come in, so optimistic there as well.
I think when you look into some of the things like card revenue and some of the other fee-based types of
situations, it's a little bit up in the air still. As the economy opens up, as the vaccines become more prevalent, as
people basically – where I'm going is as people start to spend money, we should see those return. Just don't
know yet if that's going to return to pre-pandemic levels, or is something going to be different. How has consumer
behavior changed? The rest of it, I'd say, is kind of business as usual. We still participate in kind of swaps and
other fee sources such as that. But again, always open to looking and considering something that we're not

currently doing or how we could possibly expand what we're currently doing in the investment world or something
of that nature.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay, that's helpful. And then just – could you just talk about your asset sensitivity here? You guys are naturally
asset-sensitive. And it seems like the asset sensitivity might have increased just given the building liquidity and
significant proportion of loans that are repricing here in the next six months [ph] are just about the (01:04:56)
impact of floors. But just kind of putting it all together, how do you think about that and how do you plan to
manage your rate sensitivity, and maybe does that give you some confidence to potentially take on some duration
in the securities book?

Aaron James Deer A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well, we've done just that actually. [ph] There's new things (01:05:16), and during the quarter we've purchased
$1.1 billion in securities with net growth of a little over $900 million. The – and we have – I should say, we've
attempted to put a little more duration on there. I think what we've purchased had about 6.7 years duration on
average if I recall correctly. But it didn't extend the overall portfolio duration that materially were still below five
years there.
And in doing so, we arguably have taken some asset sensitivity off the table to generate a little better interest
income near term rather than letting that all sit in cash. But I think that's the right decision. We still have an
enormous liquidity position. And that book alone is going to be throwing off around $600 million a year in cash
flows, which we hope to redeploy into higher yield and loans as loan growth comes back in a more material way.
So, I would say, we are arguably a little less asset-sensitive today than we were three months ago. But it's – I still
think we're extremely well-positioned for rise in rates. I mean, the real secret there is our cost of funds. And
there's – our deposits are just phenomenal [ph] amidst a very low (01:06:50) cost of deposits, and that's going to
serve us extremely well if we want to eventually [indiscernible] (01:06:58).
