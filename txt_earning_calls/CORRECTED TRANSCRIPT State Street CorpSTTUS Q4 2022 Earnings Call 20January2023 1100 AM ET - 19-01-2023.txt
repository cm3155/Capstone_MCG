Ronald Philip O'Hanley
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Thank you, Ilene, and good morning everyone. 2022 was an unpredictable year for many of the world's investors
and the people they serve. Despite a market rebound in the fourth quarter, 2022 was the worst year for financial
markets since the global financial crisis. Both fixed income and equity markets fell, impacted by the war in Ukraine
and several macroeconomic headwinds, including broken supply chains, price and wage inflation, dramatically
higher global interest rates, US dollar strength and heightened fears of global economic recession, which remain
today. The uncertainty created by these factors contributed to a meaningful year-over-year declines in global
financial markets as well as increased market volatility impacting flows.
Despite these difficult macro conditions, State Street performed well. As a result, we continued to progress in
2022 towards achieving our medium-term targets. Our durable 4Q and full-year 2022 results were driven by a
strategy underpinned by our relentless focus on innovation, the power of our distinct value proposition, and State
Street's diversified products and services, all of which continue to resonate with clients as demonstrated by yet
another year of strong organic net new servicing wins.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2023
As we continue to execute against our strategic agenda, we achieved a great deal in 2022. Slide 3 of our investor
presentation shows our full-year highlights and the progress we made towards achieving our strategic goals in
2022. In a challenging operating environment, and compared to what was a very strong year for our business in
2021, we again delivered positive total operating leverage, pre-tax margin expansion and a higher return on
equity, as you can see on the left of the slide. We drove continued business momentum, including $1.9 trillion of
total new asset servicing wins, delivered total revenue growth and demonstrated ongoing expense discipline in
the face of inflationary pressures and our continued investment in the resiliency and capabilities of our
businesses, as you can see on the right hand bottom of the slide.
While weaker average market levels created fee revenue headwinds for our investment servicing and asset
management businesses in 2022, our balance sheet businesses, combined with higher interest rates in our
deposit strategy produced materially higher net interest income as compared to 2021. In addition, our foreign
exchange, trading services and front office software and data businesses produced double-digit year-over-year
fee growth, manifesting the desired results of our investments in these businesses and demonstrating the
revenue diversification of our business model.
Turning to slide 4 of our presentation, I will review our fourth quarter highlights. Business momentum was solid in
the fourth quarter with new AUC/A asset servicing wins amounting to $434 billion, driven by broad-based wins
across client segments. We reported two new alpha mandates in the quarter and expanded 12 existing Alpha
relationships, seven of which added additional back and middle office offerings. Helped by the sales performance,
our AUC/A installation backlog was $3.6 trillion at quarter end. At Global Advisors, quarter-end assets under
management totaled $3.5 trillion, supported by another good quarter of ETF inflows.
Turning to our fourth quarter financial performance, 4Q 2022 EPS was $1.91 or $2.07 excluding notable items, up
7% year-over-year or 4% higher year-over-year excluding notable items. The year-over-year EPS growth in a
challenging market environment was supported by the resumption of common share repurchases in the fourth
quarter as we focused on returning capital to our shareholders. Even in a year marked by economic and political
disruptions, total revenue for the fourth quarter was the highest on record, increasing 3% year-over-year, as lower
total fee revenue was offset by very strong NII result, which increased 63% relative to the year-ago period,
primarily driven by higher global interest rates, plus our balance sheet positioning and effective execution of our
deposit management strategy.
As we meaningfully invested in our people and business, we remain focused on expense discipline in the fourth
quarter with total expenses down 3% year-over-year or flat year-over-year excluding notable items, in part
supported by the stronger US dollar. This was achieved by our relentless and ongoing focus on operational
productivity, simplification and automation.
Turning to our balance sheet and capital, our CET1 capital ratio increased to a strong 13.6% at year-end.
Recognizing the importance of capital return to our shareholders, and having already announced a 10% per share
increase to our common stock dividend earlier in 2022, we resumed share repurchases in the fourth quarter,
buying back a total of $1.5 billion of State Street's common stock.
For 2023, it is our intention to return up to 200% of earnings in the form of common stock dividends and share
repurchases, subject to market conditions and other factors. We expect our business mix, balance sheet strategy
and earnings momentum will enable us to do so while maintaining prudent capital ratios within our target range.
Accordingly, as we announced this morning, our Board of Directors has authorized a new common stock
purchase program of up to $4.5 billion through the end of 2023.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2023
To conclude my opening remarks, I am pleased to be reporting the third year in a row of pre-tax margin expansion
and higher return on equity, which demonstrates the successful progress we have made towards achieving our
financial goals.
Now let me hand the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail, before I discuss our
strategic priorities for 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Thank you, Ron, and good morning everyone. Before I begin my review of our fourth quarter and full-year 2022
results, let me briefly discuss some of the notable items we recognized in the quarter outlined on slide 5. First, we
recognized acquisition and restructuring costs, including wind-down expenses related to the Brown Brothers
Investor Services acquisition transaction, which we are no longer pursuing.
Second, we recognized $70 million of repositioning costs consisting of an employee severance charge of $50
million to eliminate approximately 200 middle and senior manager positions largely related to our Investment
Services business as we continue to streamline our organizational structure. We also recognized $20 million of
occupancy charge in the quarter to help us further shrink our occupancy costs. We expect these actions to
generate a total run rate savings of roughly $100 million.
Lastly, we recognized the benefit of $23 million in the quarter related to the settlement proceeds from the 2018 FX
benchmark litigation resolution, which is reflected in the FX trading services GAAP revenue line. Taken together,
we recognized notable items of $78 million pre-tax or $0.16 a share.
Now turning to slide 6, I'll begin my review of both our fourth quarter 2022 and full-year 2022 results. As you can
see on the top left of the table, despite the dynamic and challenging operating environment, the diversity and
durability of our business model allowed us to finish the fourth quarter with solid results.
Total revenue for the quarter increased 3% year-over-year or 5% year-over-year excluding notable items, as
lower fee revenue was more than offset by robust NII growth of 63%, which I'll spend more time discussing later in
today's presentation. We also continued to demonstrate prudent expense management, which enabled us to
deliver positive operating leverage in the quarter. And pre-tax margin is up more than 4 percentage points year-
on-year, while ROE is up more than a percentage point this quarter as well.
On the right side of the slide, we show our full-year 2022 performance. Notwithstanding the challenging operating
environment we saw in 2022 for the year, I'm quite pleased that we again delivered positive operating leverage
and nearly a percentage point improvement in pre-tax margin. As Ron mentioned, it has been three consecutive
years of margin expansion and ROE improvement.
Turning to slide 7, during the quarter we saw period-end AUC/A decrease by 16% on a year-on-year basis, but
increased 3% sequentially. Year-on-year, the decrease in AUC/A was largely driven by continued lower period
end market levels across both equity and fixed income markets globally, a previously disclosed client transition,
and the negative impact of currency translation, partially offset by net new business installations. Quarter-on-
quarter AUC/A increased as a result of higher quarter-end equity market levels and the positive impact of
currency translation.
At Global Advisors, we saw similar dynamics play out. Period-end AUM decreased 16% year-on-year and
increased 7% sequentially. The year-on-year decline in AUM was largely driven by lower period-end market

levels, some institutional net outflows and the negative impact of currency translation, which was partially offset
by $22 billion of net inflows in our SPDR ETF business. Quarter-on-quarter, the increase in AUM was primarily
due to higher quarter end market levels, ETF net inflows, and the positive impact of currency translation, partially
offset by cash net outflows.
Turning to slide 8, on the left side of the page, you'll see fourth quarter total servicing fees down 13% year-on-
year, largely driven by lower average market levels, lower client activity adjustments and flows, normal pricing
headwinds and the negative impact of currency translation, partially offset by net new business. Excluding the
impact of the currency translation, servicing fees were down 10% year-on-year. Sequentially, total servicing fees
were down 1%, primarily as a result of the client activity adjustments and flows.
On the bottom panel of this page, we've included some sales performance indicators which highlight the good
business momentum we again saw in the quarter. As you can see, AUC/A wins in the fourth quarter totaled a
solid $434 billion, driven by strong broad-based traditional wins across client segments and regions, including
expanding relationships with existing Alpha clients. At quarter end, AUC/A won, but yet to be installed, totaled
$3.6 trillion, with Alpha representing a healthy portion, which again reflects the unique value proposition of our
strategy.
Turning to slide 9, fourth quarter management fees were $457 million, down 14% year-on-year, primarily
reflecting lower average market levels and the negative impact of currency translation, which represented about
two percentage point headwind. Quarter-on-quarter, management fees were down 3%, largely due to equity and
fixed income market headwinds.
As you can see on the bottom-right of this slide, notwithstanding the difficult and uncertain macroeconomic
backdrop in the year, our franchise remains well-positioned as evidenced by our continued strong business
momentum. In ETFs, we saw solid full-year net inflows in the US with continued momentum in market share gains
in the SPDR low-cost equity and fixed income segments. In our institutional business, there's a continued
momentum in defined contribution with $48 billion of inflows in the full year, including target date franchise net
inflows of $21 billion, offset by industry-wide outflows in institutional index products. In our cash franchise, we still
gained 60 basis points of market share in money market funds in 2022, even though first half inflows reversed in
fourth quarter.
On slide 10, you see the strength of our diverse revenue growth engines with both FX trading services and
software and processing up double-digit teens year-on-year in a difficult year. Relative to the period a year ago,
fourth quarter FX trading services revenue ex-notables was up 15%, primarily reflecting higher FX spreads,
partially offset by lower FX volumes. Our global FX franchise was able to effectively monetize the less liquid
market environment, which was driven by sharp moves in the US dollar. Sequentially, FX trading services
revenue ex-notables was up 8%, mainly due to higher direct and indirect revenue.
Securities finance performance in the fourth quarter was more muted with revenues up 1% year-on-year.
Sequentially, revenues were down 6%, mainly reflecting downward pressure on spreads due to lower specials
activity and yearend risk-off activity by clients. Fourth quarter software and processing fees were up 16% year-on-
year and 17% sequentially, primarily driven by higher front office software and data revenue associated with CRD,
which were up 28% year-on-year and 25% sequentially. Lending fees for the quarter were down 10% year-on-
year, primarily due to changes in product mix and flat quarter-on-quarter. Finally, other fee revenue of $18 million
in the fourth quarter was flattish year-on-year and up $23 million quarter-on-quarter, largely due to the absence of
negative market-related adjustments.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2023
Moving to slide 11. On the left panel, you'll see fourth quarter front office software and data revenue increased
28% year-on-year, primarily driven by multiple on-premise renewals and continued growth in software-enabled
revenue associated with new client implementations and client conversions to our cloud-based SaaS platform
environment. Turning to some of the front office and Alpha business metrics on the right panel, the $21 million of
new bookings in the quarter was once again well diversified across client segments, including asset owners,
wealth and private markets, as well as across asset classes, particularly in fixed income. Front office revenue
backlog and pipeline remains healthy, giving us confidence in the future growth of this business. As for Alpha, we
are pleased to report two new Alpha mandate wins this quarter in the insurance and asset owner clients
segments.
Now, turning to slide 12. Fourth quarter NII increased 63% year-on-year and 20% sequentially to $791 million.
The year-on-year increase was largely due to higher short- and long-term market interest rates and proactive
balance sheet positioning, partially offset by lower deposits. We have a well-constructed balance sheet, including
both US and foreign client deposits, a scale sponsored repo franchise, and high quality loan and investment
portfolio that was consciously configured to benefit from rising global rates. Sequentially, the increase in NII
performance was primarily driven by higher global market rates working through our balance sheet.
On the right of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the fourth quarter. Year-on-year, average
assets declined 6% and increased 3% sequentially, primarily due to deposit levels as well as currency translation
impacts. The US client deposit beta, excluding some new deposit initiatives, was about 65% to 70% during the
fourth quarter. Foreign deposit betas for the quarter were much lower, in the 20% to 50% range, depending on
currency. Our international footprint continues to be an advantage. Total average deposits were up sequentially.
We saw a sequential quarter reduction in noninterest-bearing deposits of 5%, which was more than offset by
higher NII-accretive interest-bearing deposits that will help support high quality client loan growth and selective
expansion of the investment portfolio.
Turning to slide 13. Fourth quarter expenses, excluding notable items, were once again proactively managed in
light of the tough fee revenue environment and flat year-on-year or up approximately 3% adjusted for currency
translation. We have been carefully executing on our continued productivity and optimization savings efforts,
which generated approximately $90 million in year-on-year gross savings for the quarter or approximately $320
million for 2022, achieving near the top end of our full year expense optimization guidance of 3% to 4%. These
savings enabled us to drive positive operating leverage and pre-tax margin expansion, while partially offsetting
continued wage inflation headwinds and continued investments in strategic parts of the company, including Alpha,
private markets, technology, and operations automation.
On a line-by-line basis compared to 4Q 2021, compensation/employee benefits were down 1%, as the impact of
currency translation and lower incentive compensation was partially offset by higher salary increases associated
with nearly 6% wage inflation and higher head count. Headcount increased 9%, primarily in our global hubs as we
added operations personnel to support growth areas, such as Alpha and private market, invested in technology
talent and insourced certain functions. There was also a portion of the head count increase associated with some
hiring catch-up post-COVID. We expect head count to increase more modestly in 2023.
Information systems and communications expenses were down 5% due to benefits from our insourcing efforts
and continued vendor pricing optimization, partially offset by technology and infrastructure investments.
Transaction processing was up 1%, mainly reflecting higher broker fees and market data costs, partially offset by
lower sub-custody costs related to lower equity market levels. Occupancy was down 17%, largely due to an
episodic lease-backed real estate transaction associated with the sale of our data centers, which was worth

approximately $12 million. And other expenses were up 12%, primarily reflecting higher professional fees and
travel costs.
Moving to slide 14. On the left side of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios
followed by our capital trends on the right of the slide. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating
environment with strong capital levels relative to our requirements. At quarter end, standardized CET1 ratio of
13.6% increased 40 basis points quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by episodically lower RWA, partially offset by
the resumption of share repurchases in the quarter. With respect to RWAs, it's worth noting that we saw unusually
low RWAs this quarter, worth about $10 billion, largely driven by our markets businesses and some specific
currency factors. We would anticipate a similar amount of normalization of RWA in the $10 billion to $15 billion
range going into first quarter.
Our Tier 1 leverage ratio of 6% at quarter end was down 40 basis points quarter-on-quarter, mainly due to the
resumption of share repurchases in the fourth quarter. We were quite pleased to return $1.7 billion to
shareholders in the quarter, consisting of $1.5 billion for common share repurchases and $220 million in common
stock dividends. Lastly, as Ron mentioned earlier, we announced this morning that our board of directors has
authorized a new common stock repurchase program of up to $4.5 billion through the end of 2023. And as I said
in December, we expect to execute this buyback at pace and get back to our target ranges for both CET1 and
Tier 1 leverage market conditions and other factors dependent.
Turning to slide 15. Let me cover our full year 2023 outlook as well as provide some thoughts on the first quarter,
both of which have significant potential for variability given the macro environment we're operating in. In terms of
our current macro expectations as we stand here today, we expect some point-to-point growth in global equity
markets in 2023, which equates to global equity markets being down about 2 percentage points year-on-year on a
full year average basis. Our rate outlook for 2023 largely aligned with the forward curve, which I would note is
moving continuously. However, we currently expect to reach peak rates of 5% for Fed Funds, 3.25% at the ECB,
and 4.5% at the Bank of England.
As for currency translation, we expect the US dollar to be modestly stronger than the major currencies on
average, but less than what we saw last year. As such, currency translation is likely to have a 0.5 point or less
impact on both revenues and expenses. In light of the macro factors I just laid out, we currently expect that full
year total fee revenue will be flat to up 1% ex-notable items, with servicing fees likely flattish and management
fees down a bit, largely due to a modest reclassification of revenue out of fees into NII.
Regarding the first quarter of 2023, we currently expect fee revenue to be down 1% to 2% ex-notable items on a
sequential quarter basis, given some normalization of foreign exchange market volatility that impacts our trading
business with servicing fees expected to be up 1% to 2% and management fees expected to be down 1% to 2%.
We expect full year 2023 NII to be up about 20% on a year-over-year basis after a very strong 2022. This is
dependent, of course, on the outcome of rate hikes and deposit mix and levels. After a significant step up in fourth
quarter 2022 NII, we expect first quarter 2023 to be flattish. And after the first quarter of 2023, we expect to see a
slight 1% to 2% of sequentially quarterly attenuation of NII throughout the remainder of 2023, then with a
stabilization expected in 2024.
Turning to expenses. As you can see in the walk, we expect expenses ex-notables will be up 3.5% to 4% on a
nominal basis in 2023, driven partially by wage and inflationary pressures and continued investment in the
business and our people, while still driving positive operating leverage. You can also see on the walk that for full
year 2023, we expect gross saves of approximately 3%, which will help offset inflationary pressures and variable
costs and ongoing investments in areas like private markets and Alpha and further automation.

Regarding the first quarter of 2023, on a year-over-year basis, we expect expenses ex-notable items to be up
about 2%. Finally, taxes should be in the 19% to 20% range for 2023. This outlook would deliver a fourth
consecutive year of margin expansion and advances us towards our medium-term target goal of 30% as well as
deliver positive operating leverage and strong EPS growth for our shareholders.
And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Thanks, Eric. As we enter 2023, we see an uncertain environment. On the positive side, many supply chains have
been repaired, the outlook for energy supply is better than anticipated, particularly in Europe, and developed
world inflation may have peaked. We foresee continued rising interest rates in the short-term, but at a slower
pace. The most significant known risks are geopolitical, including the Russia-Ukraine war, China from an
economic performance and policy perspective, and the United States as it approaches its debt ceiling.
Turning to slide 17. Even with another year of economic and geopolitical uncertainty ahead of us, we continue to
be very clear in our strategic priorities for 2023, focusing on what we can control. We plan to deliver further
growth, drive innovation, and continue to enhance shareholder value as we further progress State Street towards
its medium-term targets.
First, we are targeting further improvements in our business growth and profitability by leveraging State Street's
Alpha value proposition and enhancing its private markets capabilities, as we aim to become the leading
investment servicer platform and enterprise outsourced solutions provider in the industry. We intend to maintain
and extend our leadership positions in a number of key businesses. In Global Markets, we aim to expand wallet
share as a leading provider of liquidity, financing, and research solutions to investment professionals. At Global
Advisors, we aim to build on our strengths in areas such as ETFs and cash, while organically accelerating growth
efforts in fast-growing segments where we can win.
Second, as we have over the past several years, we must continue to transform the way we work by driving
increased productivity and efficiency throughout our organization, as we build out a simplified, scalable,
configurable end-to-end operating model. As we lead with client service excellence, productivity will become a
core differentiator of our value proposition. Third, we must continue to build a higher-performing organization. We
are strengthening execution skills and increasing accountability, thereby fostering an even more results-oriented
culture required for future growth. Our fourth priority is supported by and the intended outcome of the first three
priorities and is aimed at achieving our financial goals, meaning another year of positive operating leverage,
margin expansion, and higher returns.
To conclude, supported by our distinctive value proposition and diversified offerings, as well as our ability to
manage State Street through challenging environments, I believe we will be able to execute on each of these
strategic priorities in 2023 as we advance towards achieving our financial goals, all while being an essential
partner to the world's investors and the people they serve.
And with that, operator, we can now open the call for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator
Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thank you very much. I like the NII outlook. I want to ask you a little question on that. You've been a big
beneficiary of higher rates. I'm curious on the deposits side, down almost 10% year-on-year in the quarter, but
actually up a drop sequentially. I wanted to think about – or could you tell us what you're thinking about, first, that
you have stable outlook for 2023 for deposits. We've seen a lot of fear in the banks in deposit runoffs and betas
and attrition, so curious what gives you that confidence for the flat deposits for the year. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Glenn, it's Eric. We've navigated through interest rate cycles before, right. And so, we have a fair amount of
internal data. And we also have, I think, an engagement with our clients that really understands the multiple
avenues for them of putting their cash. Clients broadly with us have $1 trillion of cash, some of that's in deposits,
some of that's in our sponsored repo program, some of that's in our Global Advisors, money market complex,
some of it's in our suite products, in our State Street Global Link franchise. And so, what we're seeing is that
clients are shifting gently their deposits between different categories, but they also need an outlet for that cash.
They need an outlet for that cash at a reasonable price, at a reasonable ability to move it and use it as necessary.
So, with that as context, I think we continue to see some expected rotation out of noninterest-bearing into interest-
bearing, that's been happening, I think, at a reasonable pace and kind of in line more or less with what we've seen
before and we expect that to continue for the next few quarters. At the same time, clients do have cash, especially
given the risk-off environment, but in general, they all sit on cash as part of their investment planning, and we
found that they're engaged with us to leave cash in our balance sheet. They like the flexibility. They like some of
the pricing. And obviously, some cash comes in at noninterest-bearing, some at lower rates when it's very
transactional, some at rates that are closer to market levels.
And so, it's an ongoing engagement with them and the visibility we have is reasonably good. It can always
change, but deposits as a result, seem to be in the zone now after a couple quarters in the first half of the year of
coming down a bit, seem to be flattening out. I won't say that we won't see a little bit of seasonality occasionally in
January until February, we see a downtick, and then March as folks prepare for tax payments is up and then April
is down. So, we'll see some of that kind of movement. But on average, we expect deposits to be flattish from –
going forward into next year and through the bulk of the year.

Glenn Schorr Q

I appreciate that color. That's good. You mentioned repo. So, maybe I'll just have my follow-up question. In the
slides, I noticed you created this Venturi platform for peer-to-peer repo, I would love a minute to quarrel on, what

Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Sure. This is part of the, I think, innovation heritage that we have here at State Street across the franchise, but
inclusive of Global Markets area. Our sponsored repo program, which is now $100 billion in size, we started in –
I'm sorry, in 2005 I think, if I go back to the history books, and it's now a $100 billion franchise, right, as an
example, and we do this in FX, we do this in sec lending. Venturi is a repo offering that instead of working through
our balance sheet or one of the clearing corporations which is how we do repo today, actually directly connects
lenders and borrowers of securities and cash. And so, it's just another platform, so to speak, another venue that
clients seem to want to engage with.
A big part of it early on is working with the asset owners, those who are – have long booked securities and cash.
And what we find is sometimes when they may want to make margin calls for – or have margin calls, they want to
raise cash without selling securities, right. And so, a natural question of, well, where do I repo, do I repo through a
bank structure or do I repo with someone who's on the other side of that trade, right, who actually wants to lend
against securities. And so, we find that there are counterparties on the other side of that trade who would be
interested in doing that.
And what Venturi does is it actually connects borrowers and lenders with a direct access to one another. So, they
have both the underlying collateral as the stabilizing force, and then they have the counterparty rating. And with
different counterparties, you get slightly different pricing and sometimes that flow-through is actually positive and
quite appealing both to the lenders and borrowers. So, that's a little bit of it in a nutshell. We like to grow it to
some amount during the course of the year, early returns are positive, but it's a – I'll put it in the bucket of
innovation and how to connect folks in the capital markets, but connect folks who our core clients and provide
additional services for them.

Okay. One follow-up question on NII and then a question on expenses. Just the follow-up question on NII, Eric, I
just wanted to make sure I understood the cadence, the pace that you are suggesting NII should follow. I know
you used the word attenuate, but we had a debate over here as to which way attenuate was going to traject. So,
sorry to ask the ticky-tacky, but appreciate it.

Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
That's all right. Betsy, we want to be transparent and sometimes language always matters, as you say. Our
perspective is we've got a very nice step-off point from fourth quarter NII. We said we'd be roughly flattish into the
first quarter. And then, we expect it to trend downwards, so attenuate downwards, let's say, 1% to 2% for the next
few quarters. Just as you see a tailwind of interest rates creating a positive, but you see that continued rotation
out of net interest-bearing deposits being a headwind, and the net of that is down NII, we think 1% to 2% for a
couple quarters. And then, towards the end of the year and into 2024, we see rough stabilization, partly because
we've kind of burned out on the noninterest-bearing rotation, and then we get to a more stabilized area. But all in,
we expect full year NII to be up about 20% year-over-year and we'll take it from there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Yeah. No. That's helpful. And then, on the expense side, I know you mentioned that the benefit of the
actions you've taken – am I right, $100 million run rate? I just wanted to understand when that comes into the
2023, is that immediate in 1Q or is that something that comes in over time? Just that would be helpful. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. Roughly about half of that comes in in 2023. The payback on most of these actions is about five quarters,
so roughly half comes in on a fiscal 2023 basis. And then, we'll hit the run rate, I think, within quarters – whatever,
six-ish or something after these actions, most of these actions are in the next few – well, let's call the next quarter.
The run rate then builds to $100 million. So, good payback, and the kind of actions we want to keep taking in this
kind of environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. So, your point, that was my final follow-up which was, do you feel this is the extent or if, for whatever
reason, top line disappoints based on macro not working out or what have you, is there more that you would
consider doing going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Betsy, it's Ron. Maybe I'll take that. I mean, we've obviously got a pattern of investments that we're intending to
execute. We've also got an ongoing program in place that we've really had running now since 2019. So, we
certainly – if the environment were to change materially, we would think about those investments. We'd also think
about being more aggressive. I mean, we have more or less in the background continue to take a lot of gross
expense out of the system every year, we see an ongoing ability to do that, but we also want to keep investing in
the business. So, there is a balance there, but to the extent to which things started to go south in an unanticipated
way, we do have levers.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if we – if you had any kind of just – well, post-game thoughts, post the
BBH decision, and within that, just you acknowledged and put forth this $4.5 billion capital plan. Just how will we
think about just your commitment to that now as opposed to whatever thoughts you might have about acquisitions
going forward? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Ken, I mean, as we've always said, we've got a very clear strategy and M&A is not a strategy. M&A is a way to
help execute a strategy, to move it faster, to enable it to get further than what's anticipated, but it's not a strategy
by itself. We are very comfortable with our organic strategy. BBH was a scale-enhancing acquisition that we
would have liked to have done, but it doesn't materially change – in fact, it doesn't change at all our strategy. So,
at this point, where we sit, we have a strategy that we like, we have a strategy that we're executing against. There
are some big milestones that we're confident we're going to be delivering on in 2023. And therefore, we are
committed to that share buyback.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay, great. And then, on servicing fees, can you help us understand in your flat to plus 1%, what's the impact of
the BlackRock ETF deconversion? Where are we in that process and how much, if any, has already been
recognized of that expected revenue attrition at this point? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. I think maybe just to answer that in the various components, I think you saw the BlackRock transition begin
at the end of last year, was $10 million in the quarter, sort of, call it, a $40 million run rate. That continues to
transition out in 2023 and in 2024. There's, obviously, just a natural schedule that you expect that we've worked
closely with them on. And so, it'll impact our servicing fees during 2023, during 2024, and into 2025, just when you
think about the year-on-year comparison basis. I think if you want to model it out, broadly, we've said in our last
regulatory filing, we said it was worth about 2% of fees as of the December 31 point that we just crossed.
It's now about 1.7% of fees, and I'll let you sort of build it from there. But it's included in our forecast. It will
continue to be included in our forecast. We think about net new business, right. We've got to a sound – we always
have a bit of attrition and we'll – we want to continue to be net ahead, and as you've seen us in the last couple
years, we've been net positive with net organic growth broadly. And then, with BlackRock specifically, they
continue to be a very important client of ours. We have continued and kept a good amount of business that we do
with them. We're strong providers for them in alternatives which is growing quickly and we've also been awarded
new business over the last year. And so, it will just – I think it will just be part of the outlook that I give you as we
go forward.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go
ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Maybe just to follow-up on Ken's last point around servicing fees, I
guess, if you take your run rate servicing fees at the end of the year, it still implies a pretty wide gap versus where
you guys expect to end for 2023. So, maybe just provide a little bit more granularity where the ramp is going to
come from. So, I know equity market is one thing and you guys are assuming, I think, 10-ish-percent growth in
global equity, so that certainly helps. But off of the kind of $4.8-ish-billion run rate that you exited to get to – I don't
know, $5.1 billion, that's a 6% growth, that's still wider than we've seen in the past. So, I'm just curious whether it's
new business or something else that you see on the horizon that will help you bridge that gap.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. Alex, if you – I think I tend to spend a little more time on the full year-to-full year kind of servicing fees, it
sounds like you're modeling the last four quarters and then the next four quarters which, obviously, we model as
well and we have in our budget. It's really a combination of factors, right. So, there is – if you start with fourth
quarter of 2022 and then work forward, we expect some appreciation in equity markets. We'll see if that plays out
and we'll, obviously, stay in touch with you all. We think that will be a tailwind.
We think client flows and activity in particular should not be a headwind like it was in 2022, maybe neutral, maybe
a positive, just as clients have adapted to this new environment. And so, we see the New Year – this New Year as
a time when they're going to be trading, investing, building positions. So, we'll see if that plays out. That will be
part of it. Then, we have net new business. And so, we do have a good pipeline, both in the traditional servicing
and Alpha area. And I think as part of that, we continue to mine our existing client base, because the share of
wallet growth can be positive there. And then, finally, there's always some amount of normal pricing headwinds,
but that's factored in. But you kind of have to go through those four areas, and remember, we're assuming some
growth in equity markets on a point-to-point basis, but we'll see if that plays out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
I got you. All right. That's helpful. Maybe just a follow-up around the balance sheet strategy, I heard the NII
guidance, the deposit commentary, all makes sense. When it comes to the tailwinds from sort of repricing the
fixed portfolio, the fixed securities portfolio, can you help us frame what the roll-on/roll-off dynamic looks like
today? And also, whether or not there are some more opportunistic actions you guys might take, like I've seen
with both BK and Northern over the last month or so, with respect to just maybe reaccelerate some of the lower-
yielding securities roll off into something that might be a little more attractive here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. Let me describe it as follows. The investment portfolio has an average duration of a bit over two-and-a-half
years, so call it average maturity of five years. And so, you go through the math and that means about 20% of it
rolls on/rolls off in a typical year. It will move around a bit. I think what we found, and that's invested across the
curve, it's invested in various currencies, so there's a mix. So, you tend to get as you have roll-off/roll-on
somewhere between 1%, 1.5%, 2%, sometimes 2.5% tailwind for that particular quarter of the amounts that are
rolling off and rolling on. And so, that's what's actually been one of the factors that's in billing the yields and the

yields improvement on the portfolio, and both how it was designed and what we're pleased to see. So, that will be
a gentle tailwind assuming five-year rates stay more or less where they are and European rates continue to float
up. And so, we'll just have to – that will be one of the tailwinds that we see.
In terms of more dramatic action, we obviously always think about what we might do. What we've noticed is that, if
you have high risk-weighted asset positions in your – or risk-weighted asset-intensive positions in your portfolio,
then what happens, you could take the loss, you reinvest, and it helps accelerate a buyback, right. That's why I
think a number of players are doing that. Doing just the – for vanilla instruments, treasuries, agencies,
government-guaranteed securities, there's – I think the benefits are a little closer to a push. We could take some
losses through the P&L. They're already in the equity account through AOCI. You put on NII in the future. I think
that's just moving around of the financials and we just don't find that that's a particularly compelling trade to do.
We'll always evaluate. We'll also – we'll see if we have specific positions that might need some adjustment, but
we don't see that as particularly compelling. It's not really compelling economically and the financial benefits you
guys can kind of model out either way. And so, I think we're pleased with the ability to continue to manage the
portfolio in line with our current processes and they've been [ph] numerous (00:50:33), right. The NII is up
significantly this past year and up another 20% next year, and we've got a tailwind and it – I think it bodes well for
where we are and where we're going.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. And just on the net interest revenue outlook for 2023, Eric, can you talk a
little bit about what you view as sensitivity to say if we had rate cuts in the back half of the year? I don't think that's
assumed in your outlook, but just if you can talk about that dynamic and whether you think that would just be
offset by reducing the deposit beta? And then, also on the foreign deposit beta that you talked about, which is
much better than US, do you expect that to continue or do you see incremental foreign deposit betas moving
higher from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. Let me do it in reverse order. The US versus foreign currency betas in our experience, this cycle, prior
cycles, do tend to run at different levels, partly because the US has the structure of noninterest-bearing versus
interest-bearing deposits, right. So, the client deposit betas are in a subset of the total. And partly because the
international markets just operate a bit differently how we're paid and how that – how those expectations have
been set over, I'll call it, decades for the industry operate differently. So, I think for the – as we look into the next
few quarters, we think the US client deposit betas ex any new money that we bring in on an initiative basis is
15

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2023
going to be in that 65% to 70%. And the international betas, we think, will continue in the 20% to 50% range when
you look at euros, pound, sterling, Canadian dollars, Aussie dollars, and some of the other currencies. So, we
think they're kind of in the – they're going to be in this zone and that gives us some ability to continue to take
advantage of the interest rate increases.
If I then work through the other part of your question what happens with rate cuts, that's in our expectations, right.
That's in the forward curves, especially for the US, that there could be a December cut. There's some probability
there could be a cut before that. I think it doesn't dramatically affect, because they are late in the year. The rate
cuts don't dramatically affect the NII forecast, so we'll kind of take it as it goes. I do think you're – as you're
intimating, there's a bit of this offset which is, if the Fed is cutting rates and there's probably going to be even
more cash that clients keep on hand and deposits in the system, so there'll probably be some offsetting impact.
And obviously, with the US betas higher, conveniently rate cuts actually at some point help with the – with NII as
well. So, I think there's a fair amount of – there's a range of scenarios, let's call it, in the second half of next year.
And so, my guess is, Brian, we're going to be having this conversation often with you, and we'll certainly keep you
posted as we see some of those scenarios develop or there's more variability.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
No. That's super helpful. And then, just maybe on asset servicing, just maybe an update on how you're seeing the
pricing headwinds fold out for this year? And also, obviously, you typically do get a pricing headwind just from a
mix shift toward ETF, but maybe if you could talk about whether you think that might be offset by some of the
growth in alternatives. And then, I know I think there is an expense offset to – or I should say I believe the margin
is the same on ETFs versus say, mutual funds, so you get an expense offset. Maybe if you just want to confirm
that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. Brian, I think the pricing experience that we're seeing in the industry has been stable and consistent over
the last few years and we expect it to be consistent into next year and beyond. We just have the standard,
because our contracts are tied to equity markets, when they roll over every four, five, six years, typically, folks are
thinking where they expect equity markets to be, they know we're going to get paid, they're going to pay us more
in the coming years, and they want to share some of that. And so, there's a partial pricing offset, but it's in the 2%
headwind per year on servicing fees and been relatively consistent.

yes, the economics are different. The revenues – fees are lower, but also particularly when you're at scale, like

Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So, I'd like to start on capital. So, the buyback sends a strong
message, Ron, very encouraging to hear about your comments on M&A. But I wanted to clarify the buyback is up
to $4.5 billion. So, does the upper end of the range there assume that you're going to see some AOCI accretion?
And is the quarterly range of $120 million to $200 million still the right way to think about it, if rates are stable?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Brennan, it's Eric. The answer is yes and yes, right. If you think about it, we forecasted, just you guys – just as
you have, earnings and coming to the P&L, AOCI in that range of $120 million to $200 million a quarter, it
bounces around a little bit and it may with movements in rates, but the pull to par has been good to us and will be
a nice tailwind. There's some normalization of RWAs, which I mentioned into the first quarter, then there is some
RWA growth in our plans, because we want to continue to lend more to clients and support more with their foreign
exchange or hedging activity. So, we'll continue to do that. And then, there's the buyback. And our plan is just to,
at pace, get back into our range, and that authorization comfortably gets us there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Excellent. And then, a couple folks have touched on it before, but maybe if we think about the fee revenue,
can you please update us on the impact of market moves to fee revenues, and whether or not there's also a
corresponding impact on the expense side, too? I'd assume there's at least some degree of impact there. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. Let me do it this way. I think as we've been relatively consistent here and I think the guidance will hold a
10% average change in, let's call it, an increase in equity markets, right, will typically lead to about a 3% increase
in servicing fees, if you have both of those on average. So, that's the kind of gearing we have. It's higher on
management fees, 10% higher equity and markets tend to be closer to a 5% increase in management fees.
On the expense side, if I – it moves around a bit, but I think it's a 10% average increase in equity markets,
probably close to, let's say, around – the range, around 1 percentage point increase in expenses, could be a little
bit less, it kind of depends. But our sub-custodian costs have a gearing towards equity markets and fixed income
markets, market data in some cases does as well. So, could be half a point, could be a point, and that's part of
what we have in the expense walk and outlook that we've given. And in some ways, I think we're actually pleased
to see that particular expense increase, because that particular expense increase comes with real revenue growth
and that then delivers EBITDA and earnings growth when you bring it altogether.

go ahead.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hey, good morning. So, Eric, I actually have a two-parter if you'll indulge me just on some of the NII guidance.
First, I was hoping you could provide just some guardrails on your assumptions for NIB outflow, given you're
relatively close to the trough that we saw last cycle?
And for the second part, just since you alluded to NII stabilizing beyond 2023, even as NIB remixing pressures
abate and reinvestment tailwinds start to work through the balance sheet, was curious why NII isn't actually
growing beyond 2023? Is that a function of rate cuts, international mix, any perspective would be really helpful?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
All right. Well, the crystal balling into 2024, I got to tell you, we got a lot of variabilities playing out right now,
whether it's economics, whether it's central banks. And I think I know there's a lot of talk about what's happening
in NII, where do we go to, and then does it – what happens after we get to a peak. So I was just trying in 2024 to
kind of level set that we see stability. There's a scenario where you see growth, there are scenarios where we
may not. But it's hard. You're getting far out on our forecasting and predictions to be honest. So let's come back to
that maybe in the middle of the year. That will be a good conversation.
In terms of non-interest bearing, you saw non-interest-bearing on average was about $44 billion this quarter, this
quarter meaning fourth quarter. It was down 5% sequentially. It's bounced around quarterly. But we see – I don't
know, you could have – off the $44 billion, you could have $4 billion rotation out next quarter. You could see that
again into the next quarter. Then it starts to – or it could be $3 billion and then $2 billion and so on and so forth.
So I think we're at this level where we've seen some amount of rotation. We think it's going to continue roughly at
the pace that it's been going. So it could be anywhere between $2 billion, $3 billion and $4 billion a quarter, but
you could have some changes to that. What we do think is that we'll continue to see some of it in the first half of
the year, and then it just starts to slow down into the second half. And what we've done is used that kind of base
case into our modeling and it's all factored into the 20% increase in NII that we expect for next year.

That's great. And in my defense, Eric, since you did talk about stabilization, I felt like I had to take advantage of
that window of opportunity, so look forward to talking about it a little bit more in the middle of the year. Just one
more for me on capital management, I was hoping you could just speak to or give us some insight into the
cadence? Should we expect that buyback to be executed ratably or be a little bit more front-loaded here? And just
given the commitment or at least clearly like a strong effort to optimize your capital levels, how are you scenario
planning for the Basel IV proposal or update that we should be getting from the Fed early in 2023?

Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. All fair and it's a kind of discussion we have internally. We want to front-load the buyback. You saw us start
particularly strong this past quarter. And we want some amount of front loading. On the other hand, it's actually
quite stabilizing to the stock to have buybacks on a consistent basis. So, I think we don't want to front load at an
extreme, and we don't want to be ratably flat through the year at the extreme either, because it gives – I think it's
a good kind of market practice to have some, I'll call it, front loading, but reasonable consistency in the buyback
as well.
I think then the goal is to get into our target range at pace. And then we'd love to operate in the middle of our
range over time. That's kind of how a range is set up. But I think what we always have to do is look out on the
horizon, are the economic conditions worsening, right? And so then you may be want to run close to the upper
end of the range to insulate and prepare, or are they particularly benign and there are particularly good uses of
capital, then you might want to be at the lower end.
Similarly, I think we'll learn more about Basel III and some of the changes in capital rules maybe that comes with
other changes in capital rules, we don't know. And I think later this year we'll evaluate. And that's another reason
to either run towards in different areas of the range as well. So, it all factors in, but I think we're quite comfortable
with the direction where we want to go and then like you will – we'll think about what's on the horizon and plan for
that.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good afternoon, guys. Eric, as a follow-up on the stock repurchase commentary, did you guys and especially now
and essentially you've referenced it'd be more front-end loaded, did you guys consider an accelerated share
repurchase program?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Gerard, we did. And I think what the accelerated share repurchase program typically does is operate in such a
way that the stock buybacks accelerate within the course of the quarter, right, within the three-month period.
There are typically some benefits of that. You tend to add $0.01 around that EPS, it's actually interesting in a high
interest rate environment you also lose the NII benefit of the capital. So we've actually found that the ASRs tend
to be a push roughly. And so we often do a more typical buyback within the available trading days in the quarter in
a way that's fairly market practice as a way to return the cash and the capital to all of you.

Very good. And then I know you've pointed to the RWA benefit you had this quarter for the CET1 ratio, and I think
you said in your slides your targeted range is 10% to 11%, which, of course, you're above at this time. Do you
have any guidance on when you think you may reach your targeted 10% to 11% CET1 range?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
It will depend on – let me say it this way, we want to return the capital at pace and I've given some bookends as to
what that means. And that's I think a forecast you guys can build off of. And we want to get to our target range,
right. We don't want to wait till, I don't know, next Christmas, right. That would not be at pace in my nomenclature.
At the same time, there's just a range of what we'll move. If RWAs lighten again, it will take a little longer. If they
go back and we fully utilize our limits in our various businesses and areas, then it might be a little more quickly.
So it's hard to pin it down, but as I said, we'd like to execute the buyback at pace. We'd like to get back into a
range at pace and we're driving in that direction.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Well, thanks for all the answers on the cyclical factors. I just wanted to ask about the structural end game –
strategic end game post Brown Brothers. And the reason I ask, I count five restructurings in the last 20 years.
They seem to come around like as often as the Olympics. The fourth quarter is yet one more quarter with notable
items, I count notable items in 18 of the last 20 quarters. And I do get some of it, like you have incredible
headwinds, mutual funds markets, technical debt, you've been reinventing yourself front to back, straight through
processing serving clients, more agile tech. And I also recognize what you said at the start that the ROE and the
margins improved for a couple of years in a row. But when I look at fees, their expenses, that has gone the other
way, and it seems like maybe one root issue is fixed cost. So really the question is a concrete question, what
percent of your expenses are fixed? How does that compare to the past? I'm assuming they've come down, and
where would you like to take that? And then more broadly, what is the end game strategy after Brown Brothers?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah, let me start on that, Mike, there's a lot in there. A comment on – I'm not going to comment on past
restructurings, I'll comment on this one, right, we've made some changes to the way we organize ourselves. We
talked about that back in the middle of the year. And there's some benefits we can take out of that in terms of
simplifying the management structure, having a smaller number of senior managers, we're going to take
advantage of that. It's consistent with simplifying our business. It creates accountability and we stand by the need
to have done that restructuring.
In terms of where do we take this business going forward, it has a lot of benefits to it. It's very tied to investment
markets over time. Investment markets grow, they don't shrink. So, the actual, if you will, unit pricing, while the

unit pricing may go down, overall pricing actually – overall revenue is actually more times than that have a
tailwind. We like that business. It's also one that is changing fundamentally from being a kind of a back office,
show me the lowest price kind of thing to much more of an enterprise outsourcing business.
We are very new in that. We're very early in that transition. And we think by far, we are the best positioned to take
advantage of that in terms of the technical capabilities that we have, the people capabilities that we have, the
position we have in the marketplace. We've made initial inroads and wins in that, but there's development that we
talked about that will be delivered in 2023 and beyond, but a lot of it in 2023, that will only help strengthen our
position.
So we see the end game here in terms of the core investment servicing business as being one which is much
more akin to an outsourcing services business, much less susceptible to kind of these instantaneous, I'm going to
put it to RFP, and it's just a stickier business. And we are very respectful and wary of our competitors, because
having an edge and a lead can be easily caught up on. But right now we believe we have that edge and lead and
we're going to capitalize on it.
In the Investment Management business, again, similar kinds of changes there, we're seeing an increased desire
for the kinds of things that we do, systematic and otherwise. Asset allocation, which we are very, very good at, is
now an area that everybody is talking about after literally decades of reliance on the 60/40 model, and guess
what, it didn't work or it doesn't work at all time. It will lead to a lot of thinking and demand for that. So we like our
businesses. We like where we are strategically.
In terms of what's going to happen, will there be other Brown Brothers out there, what I do think that you will see
over time is an increasing number of competitors where this may not be their core business saying enough is
enough. The capital requirements in terms of the investment capital requirements are much too high, mostly
about the technology. If it really does continue into an outsourcing kind of environment like we believe it will, it's
going to put more demands to invest in the business. And if this is business 42 of your 80 business structure, you
might decide you don't want to be in this business. So that's how we see it going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
That was expansive. Thank you. The fixed cost part of the question, you don't report it that way, but just in rough
terms, I guess, so in the asset servicing, less RFPs, lowest price, this enterprise outsourcing, okay, investment
management, more holistic instead of the [ph] raw old (01:14:59) model. But still as you transition, you have a
certain degree of fixed costs that are tough to manage. I mean, it's not quite like a brokerage firm where you
reduce bonuses. So, like, is there any way just to ballpark how much of your expenses are fixed costs? And I
think they've come down from the past and you're probably trying to [indiscernible] (01:15:18).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Mike, its Eric. All good questions. I think that this is actually an industry which used to be variable cost intensive,
right. It was very manual, and when you add a new piece of business, you actually had to hire fund accountants
who are working on ledger paper first and then on the Excel sheets next. And so it's quite manually intensive and
variable in nature.
It's actually, as we've automated, think about the data centers, you've talked about the movement to the cloud, the
developers that we have, this business has really evolved to a fixed and semi-fixed cost oriented business in
truth. And that means that, for certain types of business, we bring on custody business, core custody, right. So,

kind of the most automated and the most – the oldest part of what sits in our franchise, that comes in, you plug it
in and the computers just process a few more times, not overnight, but literally in nanoseconds, right.
And so this has become a more fixed cost business. And so, what we need to do is, think about how do we want
to manage those fixed costs, how are they deployed, the development dollars and technology, how do we shape
that each year, because if we do that right, we'll add feature functionality and that will bring in new business over
time, that will help retention and that will help growth.
And so this is more of a fixed cost business and semi-fixed cost. Where is it? It's more 80/20 fixed and semi-fixed
than 20/80. And I think it actually has evolved. And so, what's important for us to do is to make sure that we have
the products and the offerings and the client coverage to support that and to add new business, add the right type
of new business. And then where there are variable cost components, we've talked about some of the more
manual and complex areas, right, servicing for private, for example, is still quite manual, it's complicated, there
are not standard systems, typically in the industry there's very little in third-party software that one could avail
oneself of, those are the variable areas where we need to continue to find ways to automate and streamline, and
that's part of what we're doing with the ongoing investment program that we have underway.

Robert Wildhack Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Hi, guys. AUC/A wins in the fourth quarter were pretty good. And Eric, you called out a strong pipeline there. What
level of new business wins are you expecting in 2023? And do you see those coming from any specific client
category, cohort, service area, anything like that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
As we have said, the pipeline remains strong. I think we're pleased with wins this year. Wins were about $1.9
trillion for the full year. What I have said is and I think we feel good about this target or line in the sand is we've
said to drive the kind of organic growth that we'd like, we want to win about $1.5 trillion per year of new business.
We did that this past year. We did it in spades, closer to double that in 2021. And that's our expectation. We
expect and we think that's par for 2023 as well. Obviously, we want to sell more than that, right. We want to bring
in more new clients or further deepen relationships with existing clients.
I think what we feel good about here is both the new business this year. The $1.9 trillion that has come in, has
come in at good fee rates. The fee rates of the new wins are actually in line with our overall fee rate this year. And
so that means that as it onboards, it will be neutral or even accretive to the fee rate. So that's important and that's
an important part of the program.
In terms of segments, it's been broad-based. I mean, this past quarter, for example, was broad-based across
regions, literally I think it was a third, a third, a third. And we saw particularly strong growth this past year in Asia.

We'd like to repeat that again. I think we have an intensity on Europe and North America as well. So there's not –
I'd say it's not one particular segment or one particular region. It's fairly broad. But it's a good pipeline overall.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Wildhack Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Got it. And then you also mentioned some higher renewals in the Alpha business. Wondering if you could talk
about the retention rate there? How is the retention among front to back clients compared to your more traditional
back or middle office only clients?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah, Rob, I mean in terms of fully installed Alpha clients, the retention rate is 100%. And you wouldn't expect it
to be much less than that simply because it's still relatively new. I think that there's a real commitment that's made
on both sides of the house when you enter into these things. First of all, to actually rewire the firm around – for the
client to rewire around front to back, there's a lot of effort on their part. And while there's a lot of commonality
across these clients, there's a lot on our part that we need to do to install it.
So, the contracts are longer, but the reality is that the switching costs have also gone up dramatically in these
front-to-back things. So we would expect more. But we also recognize that we've got to earn that. I mean, right
now there's a – when that happens, there's a huge dependency on the part of the client and us delivering every
day. And so, we take that responsibility quite seriously.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thank you. Just a couple of little details for you, Eric. You mentioned RWA came down by about $10 billion and
you expect to see another decline, $10 billion to $15 billion. Any color on what you did there? And is it sustainable
post 1Q?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah, let me just clarify. RWA was lower than expected in the fourth quarter by about $10 billion. And in the first
quarter we expect it to reverse, in other words to move back up by $10 billion, $12 billion, $15 billion. And it's just
driven by some of the underlying volatility in our business. For example, overdrafts were lighter than expected.
This quarter they moved around by a few billion dollars, and that moves RWA by a few billion dollars each
quarter.
In the FX book, we run a very sort of a typical forward book, two week, four week, six week forward. And as you
have US dollar appreciation or depreciation, you can get $5 billion moves in RWA relatively easily. So that's just
the volatility that we saw. We tend to be quite careful to stay within our RWA internal limits. That's why we tend

not to have upswings in RWA, but we tend to have these beneficial quarters now and then. And we'll just note
them to you so you can model out our capital ratio trends.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q

Great. Second, another little detail for you, your software processing and data, could you parse that into data
versus CRD since that's not combined, since you've got this big growth rate there, what's going on underneath?
How much is data? How much is...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

[indiscernible] (01:24:16)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
...combination. I mean, the bulk of that is really around Charles River and the franchise that we purchased back in
2018, which has really given us the kind of growth that we had expected. So you can go back and compare the
size of the franchise, I think at the last disclosure, I think we probably showed it a year ago, and compare it to that
software and data line and get a kind of, first, an adjustment. But it's the large majority, I'll say, of that line.
Data to us is though a very appealing offering that supplements what's in – sometimes sold with the Charles River
offering, sometimes with Alpha and the middle office, sometimes sold as supplemental to just custody and
accounting, because it's such a high value and informative kind of window, sometimes for risk management
purposes, sometimes for client transparency purposes for our asset manager or asset owner clients. And so it's
actually one of the faster growing areas of that area. And that's why we've put it together because it's actually a
software type sale, but an important one.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah, Vivek, it's Ron. Let me just add to that, because we've done a lot of innovation in this area of new product
development, and we do expect that to continue to grow as Eric said, because everybody is interested in
simplifying their operations, simplifying and getting control of their tech depth and innovating on the technology
side. But in addition, there's a data management, data control in some parts of the world with some investors, it's
also location of data, where does the data actually both move and rest. So, this is an increasingly – this is a
growth area. It goes beyond asset managers, large asset owners and [indiscernible] (01:26:38). So we see it as a
way to extend what we're doing broadly in the Alpha arena.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
And just to clarify on CRD, Eric, to your comment earlier, when you had previously talked about it was growing in
the sort of the low-double digit range, this was a year or two ago when it was broken out, is that still the pace at

which it's just continuing to grow? Or is that, as it matures, slowing down a little bit? Or is it accelerating, any
granularity, any color on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. No, it continues to outpace. I'd say it moves around depending on some of the on-premise renewals that
still flow through the P&L, high-single digits, low-double digits. And what we've done is continue to – the team
continues to drive kind of the core CRD offerings, you know, these – you know, it start with an equity product. It's
moved to equity and fixed income, which are now industry – I think industry – at peer levels, in some cases
industry-leading. And then what we've done is supplemented that. For example, we purchased a small company
called Mercatus, which was kind of a front-end portion of a Charles River type offering. And so, we've added a
kind of private market area to what I'll call the broader Charles River Complex.
So this is an area that I think will continue to grow probably twice the rate of State Street, help lead us forward,
but also is the tip of the spear of how we engage with clients, new clients, existing clients in broader ways. And
that's why the core software, I think is an important product. And what I think I've been pleased with especially this
year, which has been all over the place economically and politically, right, even with the equity markets up and
down, software and software growth, core Charles River, data, software for private continues to grow in this
double-digit range – low-double digit range through thick and thin, and that helps balance out I think the growth
dynamic for the company.
