Kessel D. Stelling
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Well, thank you, Kevin, and good morning everyone and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. I'd like to begin
by thanking our extraordinary team members who continue to go above and beyond to support our customers
during this difficult time. We have two main stories today and probably many more. One is of our strong core
operating performance for the first quarter pre and post coronavirus arrival. The other equally important story is of
the strength and resilience of our company, which has again proven our ability to innovate, to execute quickly,
and effectively manage day to day operations while also shifting priorities and resources to meet emerging needs.
From the very beginning of this COVID-19 healthcare crisis, the decisions and actions taken by our team have
been guided by two principles. Doing what's best for the physical and financial well-being of our team members,
and doing what's best for our customers.
With those principles in mind, in March, our branches were converted to drive-through and appointment-only and
we implemented aggressive cleaning, sanitizing and hygiene protocols at all of our company facilities. More than
80% of our 5,400 team members are now working from home, and our IT team did a fabulous job quickly
repositioning our workforce. We've offered additional paid time off to team members who were sick, who are
quarantining or dealing with childcare or other COVID related family hardships, and we're offering bonus
payments to hourly team members required to work onsite to serve our customers.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2020
To help our customers through this period of financial distress, we're waving NSF and monthly service fees and
offering payment deferment and other loan relief as appropriate. Although social distancing has more or less
eliminated the in-person hands-on approach we usually take toward community service, we're doing everything
we can to support needs across our footprint, including matching contributions to the American Red Cross,
providing financial support for feeding America and funding meals for first responders and frontline healthcare
providers.
I am especially proud of the effort our team has made to deliver Paycheck Protection Program loans to our
customers. Since the launch of P3 on April the 3rd our team has processed, approved and funded more than $2
billion in loans for 8,300 customers. We're continuing to process submissions in our pipeline preparing to fund as
many as possible with the additional appropriations made available this week. Kevin Blair will talk more about the
key aspects of our COVID-19 response later in his remarks.
Before I cover highlights of the first quarter, I want to talk about our confidence in our ability to manage through
this current crisis and to emerge from it in an even stronger position. Since the last crisis, our company has
continually taken steps to prepare for an adverse economic environment, including efforts to strengthen
management into key risk areas of capital, credit and liquidity. We routinely deploy stress testing and sensitivity
analyses to inform business decisions, and we believe we're well positioned to sustain an economic downturn,
such as we're facing today.
As we'll discuss during this morning's call, we've enhanced our portfolio monitoring and our credit profile includes
improved mix, metrics and outlook and our allowance build under CECL guidelines provides further protection
against credit losses. On capital, our internal stress testing process gives us confidence in our ability to maintain
strong capital ratios in stressed economic environments, and our liquidity position remains strong. We're also
assessing and reprioritizing strategic initiatives under our Synovus Forward program. Kevin Blair is going to share
more details later in the call on the steps we're taking to ensure we're addressing the short-term imperatives while
also focusing on the right initiatives for strengthening our company long-term.
So, before I turn the call over to Jamie, I will briefly walk through highlights of the quarter on slide 4. Adjusted
diluted EPS was $0.21 compared to $0.98 a year ago. This year-over-year decline was driven by 225 basis point
reduction in the Fed funds rate, the scheduled loss of loan accretion from acquired loans and a significant
increase to the allowance that accounts for the anticipated impact of COVID-19 under the CECL framework. We
were very pleased with the fundamentals of our core performance, including period-end loan growth of $1.1
billion, deposit growth of $1.4 billion, and core transaction deposit growth of more than $600 million.
Core net interest income which excludes purchase accounting adjustments was flat for the quarter. However, the
core net interest margin declined 5 basis points from the prior quarter, slightly more than our original expectations
due to the more significant reduction in interest rates.
Adjusted non-interest revenue of $99 million grew $7 million from a banner fourth quarter benefiting from
significant activity in mortgage, capital markets and fiduciary businesses. This was despite lower seasonal core
banking fees and increased fee waivers as part of our effort to serve clients during this COVID-19 disruption.
Adjusted non-interest expense totaled $271 million for the quarter, up $6 million versus the previous quarter,
largely due to the $5 million increase in seasonal payroll taxes that were referenced during our fourth quarter
earnings call. We also had an incremental $1 million in expenses associated with the COVID related bonus
payments for certain frontline team members. Provision for credit losses was $159 million and resulted in an

allowance for credit losses ratio of 1.39%. These metrics incorporate the impact from COVID and the first quarter
of CECL.
I'll now turn the call over to Jamie for a more detail look at the first quarter beginning on slide 5, and I'll rejoin with
a few more comments in question-and-answer after Jamie and Kevin Blair have given their report.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr.
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kessel. Before I get started walking through the quarterly performance, I'd like to highlight that we
have withdrawn our 2020 guidance. We will give some near-term indications of financial performance on key
metrics throughout my commentary and we are committed to reestablishing longer term targets when the
economy stabilizes.
We discussed our increased productivity a bit on the fourth quarter call and it continued on to the first quarter with
$3.1 billion in total loan production. Our wholesale banking team on boarded 155 new customers during the
quarter which represented $1 billion in new loans. In March, we saw $300 million increase in line utilization. C&I
line utilization plateaued at 50% in March as some customers increased draws out of an abundance of caution
related to the economic situation. We are confident in the credit quality of our growth this quarter as we remain
disciplined in our underwriting.
In the second quarter, we expect loans from the Paycheck Protection Program to serve as the primary engine for
loan growth as traditional pipelines have declined. The rate cuts in March led loan yields of 4.6% excluding
purchase accounting, a decline of 15 basis points from the prior quarter. The full quarter impact of these March
cuts will have a greater impact on the average loan yields in the second quarter. Unadjusted for hedges
approximately 50% of our loans have a floating rate.
As previously discussed, we have a hedging program in place to help mitigate the impact of changes in short-term
rates on our floating rate loan portfolio. At quarter end, we had $2.8 billion in receive-fixed swap associated with
these hedges with an average rate of 1.4% versus one-month LIBOR.
Slide 6 shows deposit growth of $1.4 billion which included a continued increases in core transaction deposits of
$623 million. In the first quarter, we took advantage of reduced pricing on wholesale broker deposits to increase
balances and replace higher-cost single-service deposits. We will continue to monitor these markets for
opportunities in what remains a dynamic deposit environment and remain focused on growing our core deposit
base and maintaining a prudent liquidity profile.
In terms of overall deposit pricing, we've certainly seen a response to the recent FOMC actions. And as you can
see, our total interest-bearing cost in March was approximately 30 basis points lower than the average from the
prior quarter. In this easing cycle, the FOMC cut their target rate by 225 basis points and our general expectations
is for cycle betas to end in the low to mid 30s as deposits repriced throughout the year.
As you can see on slide 7, net interest income of $373 million declined $26 million from the prior quarter. The
majority of that decline or $25 million was attributable to the expected decline in purchase accounting
adjustments. The core net interest margin which excludes PAA decreased 5 basis points from the prior quarter to
3.35%.
As we look into the second quarter, we expect net interest income to remain relatively flat as a result of significant
loan growth associated with P3. However, this growth along with the depressed rate environment and an elevated

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2020
cash position is expected to weigh on our net interest margin. Excluding those impacts, we reiterate that we
expect the margin to decline 4 basis points to 5 basis points per 25 basis point decrease. We expect the majority
of the impact from March rate cuts to be realized in the second quarter.
On slide 8, you will see that we have had continued success in fee revenue generation, which increased to $99
million adjusted. That's an increase of $7 million from the prior quarter and up $21 million or 27% versus the prior
year. In the first quarter, we continue to have diversified strength in our fee revenue businesses. Mortgage
revenue driven by high production levels and elevated secondary gain on sale margins increased $3 million.
Capital markets volumes were higher by $2 million as our commercial clients locked down lower rates on their
borrowings. And income from brokerage grew $1 million driven by increasing contributions of new hires in 2019
and higher transaction revenue from elevated market volatility.
These increases more than offset reductions in areas such as service charges on deposit accounts, primarily due
to a decline in retail NSF fees. However COVID is already impacting customer behavior, including significant
declines in capital markets activity, lower debit and credit card transaction volumes and overall business
disruption for commercial clients. This disruption will likely result in fee revenue declining 15% to 25% in the
second quarter from our recent run rate of approximately $90 million. We would expect an increase in non-interest
revenues as the economy stabilizes.
Moving to slide 9, in the first quarter, non-interest expense was $276 million or $271 million adjusted. Adjusted
expenses increased $6 million from the prior quarter, generally in line with our prior guidance. With the increased
levels of the COVID-related expenses which we currently estimate at $5 million to $6 million in the second
quarter, we expect adjusted expenses to remain relatively stable quarter-on-quarter before declining in the
second half of the year.
As Kevin will discuss in a moment, we remain confident that our efforts over the past six months to identify ways
to improve our operating efficiency will result in positive operating leverage over the long-term. We are tailoring
the timing of our Synovus Forward initiative to ensure they do not distract from our focus on team members,
customers and communities. This doesn't change our commitments or strategy, it simply adjusts the timing.
Slide 10 shows our credit quality metrics, as well as a summary of our provision for credit losses and allowance.
Net charge off at 21 basis points remain within prior guidance. The NPL ratio did increase from the prior quarter to
41 basis points and this is up 1 basis point from the prior year. Additionally, past dues returned to the low end of
the recent range at 22 basis points.
While we expect to experience stress in the portfolio as it progress through the current economic environment, it
is important to note that we are entering this downturn well positioned from a credit quality standpoint with NPAs,
NPLs, past dues and charge-off at/or near lows for this economic cycle. Provision for credit losses and allowance
for the quarter were impacted by the adoption of CECL on January 1, which generally results in higher provision
for credit losses compared to the incurred loss method. This is amplified by the forward-looking aspects of CECL,
and how it is impacted by the heightened economic stress from the healthcare crisis and resulting economic
slowdown.
As you can see on slide 11, the Day 1 reserve increase was $110 million or 39%. We did elect the five-year
transition period for regulatory capital treatment. Our 10-K referenced a two year reasonable and supportable
period used in CECL estimates, but it was deemed more appropriate to reduce that to one year horizon during
this period of heightened economic uncertainty. A one year reversion to the mean follows the reasonable and
supportable period. The deterioration in the economic environment since January 1st due to the current

healthcare crisis, resulted in a higher allowance for credit losses ratio as of March 31st, than was modeled in the
Day 1 CECL implementation and is currently at 1.39%.
Our modeling process incorporates quantitative and qualitative considerations that are used to inform CECL
estimates. The internally developed economic forecasts used to determine the allowance for credit losses as of
March 31st was approved on March 20th. At the time, the approved forecast aligned with rating agency and Wall
Street economic forecast. Between that approval date and quarter end, we saw further deterioration in the
economic outlook, which resulted in the need for a qualitative overlay to our allowance for credit losses.
The qualitative overlay of $37 million adds 10 basis points to the allowance for credit losses and better aligns the
total allowance with the economic indicators and forecasts at the end of the first quarter. Significant economic
uncertainty remains as a result of the continuing healthcare crisis and they ultimately impact our government
stimulus efforts. If our economic outlook on June 30th resembles these more recent forecast, we would expect to
see further increase in the allowance for credit losses.
Capital ratios on slide 12 include the impact of CECL and incorporate applicable regulatory transition periods. As
we've shared in the past, our target capital ratios were determined through our routine internal capital adequacy
assessment process and included the capital optimization efforts completed in 2019. These capital ratios give us
comfort that even in a severely adverse scenario, we have a sufficient buffer to withstand the losses and remain
well capitalized.
In the first quarter, our CET1 ratio declined 8.72% largely due to the increase in risk-weighted assets which
accounted for reduction of 25 basis points. Our continued strength in PPNR generated 39 basis points of capital
which more than offset the 21 basis point impact of CECL related allowance build. As a result of CECL, we
anticipate capital ratio degradation earlier in a recessionary environment than under prior accounting guidance.
However it is that allowance which will provide a significant buffer to absorb any realized losses later in the cycle
and affords us the ability to return to our capital targets over time. Currently, the allowance build was reflected in
the total risk-based capital ratio, which increased 6 basis points from the prior quarter to 12.31%.
Based on the same framework that was established and utilized for stress testing under the Dodd-Frank Act, we
continue to leverage our internal capital management processes. These processes, coupled with our risk appetite
framework, provide a road map and outlines capital preservation strategies in the event we see a more protracted
period of economic weakness. As we navigate through this recession, we will be very diligent in how we deploy
our balance sheet with a clear prioritization towards core customer relationships.
These processes also govern how we consider share repurchases in our common equity dividend. Through this
process, we determined to suspend our previously approved share repurchase program. We continually evaluate
our approach to common equity dividends in our capital planning process, which is guided by our assessment of
capital adequacy as well as our projection of sustainable long-term earnings. We believe a change to the common
dividend is not warranted at this time. As discussed, we remain confident in our capital adequacy and we
continuously assess our long-term earnings outlook.
Liquidity management has always been a priority at Synovus and we continue to improve our liquidity profile. In
the first quarter, we issued $400 million of bank debt at very attractive levels and we increased our collateral at
the Federal Home Loan Bank by approximately $2 billion. As shown on slide 13, you can see that we have
approximately $14 billion in readily available balance sheet liquidity.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2020
While we expect loan balances, excluding P3 loans, to remain fairly flat over the near term, we do anticipate
considerable second quarter growth associated with our P3 lending effort. To best manage our risk and to
maintain our existing funding sources for other customer needs, we anticipate using the Federal Reserve's P3
lending facility to support funding for at least a portion of these loans. We believe that this is the most effective
way to manage our overall liquidity position and to mitigate the associated impact on our capital ratios.
Kevin will now share a deeper dive on credit portfolios most impacted by COVID, some details about our
responses to this crisis and provide an update on Synovus Forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Blair
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Jamie, and turning to slide 14. Before I go into deeper detail on several industries where the COVID-
19 crisis is currently having a greater impact on business operations, this seems like an appropriate time to take a
deeper dive into the composition and the quality of our loan portfolio by category, as well as the significance of the
diversification and de-risking benefits that have been realized since the last financial crisis.
The chart on this slide shows the key components of each of our three portfolio categories, with a table on the
bottom right showing the shift in the composition from 2009. Our C&I book totaled $17.7 billion and is primarily
comprised of general middle market and commercial banking clients across a diverse set of industries. Within
C&I, the specialty division such as senior housing and premium finance comprised about 14% of total loans and
have been a significant contributor to our growth story while also possessing some of the best credit metrics over
the last several years.
The overall portfolio is well-diversified by industry and geography and is extremely granular with almost 35,000
loans with an average original loan balance of approximately $770,000. The CRE portfolio is $10.7 billion and
86% of the book is comprised of income-producing properties, with multifamily, office, shopping center and hotel
being the largest property types within the portfolio. We do adhere to a disciplined concentration management
philosophy, thus, our largest CRE loan is less than $50 million with an average loan size of approximately $13
million.
This portfolio is diverse both from a geographic and property type standpoint with strong loan-to-value and debt
service coverage levels. As a result, this portfolio has continued to perform well, and as it relates to net charge-
offs, the CRE book is in a net recovery position over the last five quarters.
The consumer book is $10 billion. Almost three-quarters of the consumer portfolio is in mortgage and HELOC
categories with the remainder in lending partnerships, credit cards and other consumer. You can see by the credit
score and loan-to-value statistics that this portfolio is super prime and remains very healthy. Under the existing
economic conditions, we expect our consumer portfolio to decline in the near term as we decrease our appetite
for unsecured lending and third-party partnership purchases.
The last point I want to cover on this slide is the substantial improvement that we've made to the diversification
and derisking of the entire loan portfolio. From 2009 until first quarter in 2020, we have significantly reduced our
exposure to 1 to 4 family residential, land and investment properties, as well as CRE in aggregate. By simply
utilizing historical loss rates, the remix of our portfolio alone would result in a 50% reduction in losses. Combined
with the improvements in underwriting and portfolio management, we would expect losses to decline even further
when evaluating the impact of the severely adverse scenario.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2020
Moving to slide 15. While our entire loan portfolio is continuously assessed, we have introduced enhanced
monitoring for the segments noted on slide 15. These segments totaling $4.6 billion had been identified as having
a more direct and immediate impact from the COVID-19 crisis. We are continuously working with our customers
to evaluate how the current economic conditions are impacting their business operations and ultimately their cash
burn rate. We are leveraging payment deferments as well as the CARES Act stimulus program to help weather
short-term financial effects. Solid underwriting and strong credit performance, coupled with stronger balance
sheets that has been built during our extended expansionary period, give us confidence that these portfolios enter
this downturn in the best possible position.
In the appendix on slides 27 through 29, you will find more detail around each of these portfolios, but I will touch
on a few of them now. Our hotel book is over 85% franchised and primarily contains non-resort properties. More
than 90% of our hotels are rated upper mid-scale or above. This portfolio has strong credit metrics with an
average loan-to-value of 54% and debt service coverage ratios of 1.9 times. We have about $1 billion of shopping
center exposure to centers that aren't grocery, pharmacy or discount store anchored. Based on our Southeastern
footprint, these locations are situated in markets that has continued to see good population and household
income growth which has created growth and stability for these businesses.
As such, these portfolios continue to perform well from a credit quality standpoint. The restaurant book is $800
million with 56% of the book in limited service restaurants and 42% in full service. Over 60% of our restaurants
are franchises and have an average loan size at origination of roughly $1.5 million. The next two industries are
non-essential retail trade and arts, entertainment and recreation, combining for $1.2 billion in outstanding. Both of
these portfolios have performed well pre-crisis and are also very granular with average loan sizes at origination of
$1.8 million and $1.2 million respectively.
Lastly I will mention our relatively small exposure to oil related industries at less than 1% of total loans. Given our
five state footprint, oil is not a prevalent industry particularly as it relates to exploration and production, most of our
exposures in transportation, operations and support related to the industry. This portfolio has exhibited strong
credit performance, but given the current state of the oil industry, we are more closely monitoring our exposure.
Our bankers and credit team members continue to work with and provide financial advice and consultation to our
customers and ensure we are providing the necessary support to mitigate the short-term disruption in cash flows.
As with our entire credit portfolio, each of these portfolios has exhibited strong performance over the trailing
quarters and years and was as well positioned as could be expected coming into the current environment. The
duration of the downturn will obviously determine the impact on these businesses and how quickly these
industries will return to more normalized cash flow levels. Bob Derrick our Chief Credit Officer is with us this
morning and can answer additional questions during the Q&A portion of today's call.
As we turn to slide 16, and I address Synovus Forward, I think it's important to reinforce the message that Kessel
led off with in today's meeting. Despite rolling out our Synovus Forward playbook in March, we quickly
reconfigured our efforts to focus on our COVID response starting with the safety and well-being of our team
members who are vitally important to support our customers, as well as the communities we serve. We effectively
exercised our business continuity plan which enabled our employees to work remotely while continuing to provide
customer facing roles in our branches and call centers to meet the needs of our customers. And quite frankly that
was our other primary focus. The safety and continued service of our customers. Although we continue to practice
social distancing, we are here to serve our customers and continue to provide advice and new solutions to help
them navigate the changing business climate and support their business operation.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2020
In fact during the first quarter, we implemented over 6,000 new services in our treasury and payment solutions
area, which represented a 320% increase over the first quarter of 2019. This is another proof point of our
continued commitment to serve our customers and our ability to do so in a difficult climate. And despite the crisis,
our bankers continue to call on and onboard new prospects, as our relationship based approach is serving as a
key differentiator in this trying environment. We're going to deploy our capital in areas where we receive optimal
returns. And while this business approach may produce lower loan growth in aggregate, we will continue to focus
on acquiring new full service relationships and deepening our current relationships with new opportunities.
As we have mentioned, we've also taken a proactive approach to providing relief to our customers when needed
from waving fees to increasing ATM and mobile deposit limits to granting deferments on loan payments. Our loan
deferment program is constructed to allow smaller loans upon request to receive a short-term 90-day deferral of
interest and principal to the maturity date of the loan.
For larger loans, we have initiated a credit driven approach to review the specific circumstances of each request,
analyze cash burn and obtain updated financial information while determining the need for the deferment. To-
date, our percentage of total deferrals is around 13% of the overall portfolio with those industries more directly
impacted by COVID-19 carrying higher percentages.
We also have closely monitored all of the stimulus actions and programs made available by the CARES Act.
Obviously the Paycheck Protection Program has had the greatest impact on our customers to this point. We
began the P3 process on March 28 with an online expression of interest portal. We began taking applications on
April 3rd, the day the program went live. As Kessel mentioned earlier, as of today we have secured funding for
over 8,000 customers or approximately $2 billion.
As I close, let me transition to the future and Synovus Forward. As we shared during an investor conference in
March, Synovus Forward is our newly formed program that was built to generate an incremental $100 million of
pre-tax income in the coming years and to lead the top quartile performance amongst mid-cap banks in terms of
profitability and efficiency. During the development of this program, we evaluated over 20 unique and distinct
initiatives that included a combination of expense and revenue opportunities. During our presentation in March we
shared at a high level, we expect to realize expense benefits of between $45 million and $65 million and revenue
benefits of between $35 million and $55 million.
We're confirming today that the incremental opportunity is still very achievable. However, many of the benefits
have been delayed due to the focus on the current crisis. Many of the expense and revenue initiatives that were
planned for the first half of 2020 will be recast into the second half of the year or in early 2021. While we have had
to delay some initiatives, we are also accelerating actions in others. This includes increasing the efficiencies
gained from the third-party spend initiative, accelerating the development of digital and analytical capabilities to
drive growth and manage risk and leveraging our remote environment to aggressively think about our physical
distribution and locations.
We have also continued to invest in technology and more specifically My Synovus, our consumer digital portal. In
March, we deployed major updates to enhance the bill pay and transfer experiences of our customers. And as
we've made improvements, we've seen higher levels of enrollment and utilization while seeing our overall app
rating increase. And it's important to note that the current crisis is creating opportunities to add new initiatives to
the portfolio and resize current initiatives that we had planned. The Synovus Forward portfolio is not rigid and will
continue to evolve. We are committed to delivering and growing the value as we address new economic and
customer behavior realities.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kevin and before we move to Q&A I want to again thank our team, our customers and our
shareholders. And for a brief update on the week's activities, just wanted to share that on Wednesday, we hosted

I guess if we can just start with capital. So when we look at this, obviously you have enough capital from a
regulatory perspective, but when I look at this CET1 at 8.72%, just talk to us, Jamie, Kevin, Kessel in terms of
how important is it for the capital CET1 just to be over 9% versus where it is, and what are your expectations in
terms of when we look at the PPNR given 39 basis points that you showed for 1Q, do you expect that to lead you
back to over 9%, what are your expectations on growth in other risk weighted assets given PPP should not really
impact that? Just if you can to all of that, that would be helpful.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2020
Yeah, Ebrahim. Let me start, and then I'll turn to Jamie. I think your first question was how important is it. We've
said that we believe the target of 9% was an appropriate target leading into this. And so we dipped slightly below
that. Quite frankly there was – the big driver was the growth in risk-weighted assets this quarter and driven by
great production by our team, as you saw non-PPP long growth over $1 billion. So certainly it has now dipped
below, we don't expect that level of risk-weighted asset growth, that will diminish we believe in the second quarter.
And again, you'll see the PPP loan growth, but that will not have effect on the capital ratios. You had multiple
parts of the questions, I'm going to flip to Jamie to go a little further.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thanks, Ebrahim and Kessel, just to tag on with that. You're right, Ebrahim, that's the question we feel really good
about 9% CET1 as the starting point, we do a lot of stress testing in our capital adequacy process and we refresh
with many different scenarios. And when we look at severe adverse scenarios, if you went back to our DFAS from
a couple years ago – few years ago, you would see that we had about 2% capital degradation. Today, when we
run our stress test and severe adverse scenarios, it's a shade more than 2%, so right there again. We feel really
good and we expect capital ratios to decline when you head into an adverse scenario. However, you're right, we
have PPNRs as the first line of defense against that capital degradation, you can see in the first quarter even
though we had a large build in our allowance, PPNR was more than net allowance build. And as Kessel said, it
was the $1.1 billion of loan growth that really depleted CET1.
So, as we look forward, there's definitely some uncertainty in this environment. We don't know how everything will
play out. We feel good about our ratios where they are. I did give some guidance. You will see PPNR decline a
little bit in the second quarter due to declines in NII predominantly. NII should be fairly flat. And so as we think
about it, we feel good about where we are. We think that PPNR is the first line of defense, really covers us on our
need for allowance at this point. However, we would acknowledge the uncertainty in this environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. That's helpful. And just on the margin. So the comments you made ex-PPP essentially we should assume
like 5 basis points, kind of 630 basis points of degradation somewhere around the 3.10% margin would be kind of
where you would land in the current rate backdrop. And can you talk about just how PPP will work through the
system? If these are forgiven, should we see a spike at some point in 3Q on the yields tied to these loans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kessel D. Stelling A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
You would, Ebrahim. Again, this is Kessel. Because, obviously, you know this that we're, in theory, able to fund on
that 35 basis points if we were to match fund through the facility and we put them on the books at 1% and then
there'll be some fee associated based on the average loan, which will flow in through the loan yields. And then
when they're forgiven, that will come back in, I think, through the NII lines, so you would see an increase in margin
there.
That's just a lot of uncertainty there to-date. We have seen those fund, we have seen kind of corresponding
growth in DDA deposits, but we know that behavior won't continue. Hopefully, those customers are using the
funds to pay employees. You will see that come down and will begin accessing the PPP liquidity facility. But I
think you're right in your thinking there about how that will play out.

Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
And, Ebrahim, let me just add one thing to that. When you look at our margin forecasts, you're spot on with the 4
basis points to 5 basis points per 25 basis point and the impact of the 150 basis points in March. And then there's
two other things on top of that, you talked about P3, we would say that P3 is about 2 basis points to 3 basis points
of NIM impact per $1 billion, just to kind of give you a way to toggle that. Then the other thing, the other
consideration that would not be in our typical sensitivity is holding elevated cash. And so, we're holding more cash
on the balance sheet today than we would in normal times, and so that will be a little bit dilutive to the margin.

Kessel, long term, how do you think about some of these portfolios that are kind of more pandemic sensitive over
the near term? Are these loan portfolios you think you'll continue to be active in over the long term? And
specifically, how do you guys feel about senior housing credit and the future demand for senior housing,
depending on how this pandemic plays out?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kessel D. Stelling A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Well, let me start, Jennifer, since you addressed it to me, and then I'll ask Kevin Blair to jump in as well. I'm
going to reverse order on senior housing. We're very confident in that part of our book, there's a – in the appendix
slide 30 on senior housing that's about $2.1 billion, and again that's a vertical that has performed well since we on
boarded that team in 2011, no credit losses in that book, it's a diverse book, spread across 33 states, not much on
the West Coast, large majority 77% of that's private pay. And again there may be some short term impact related

to new admissions, if they were in theory a facility that had an outbreak. Reports I've had, our facilities are in good
shape. But you have to be careful about what information you know. But to the best of our knowledge, those
facilities are in good shape. So long-term there's going to be a lot of demand there. Again short-term if you had a
facility that was slowing admissions, it could be a short-term, but we again we think that part of our business is
certainly a strength, and I would put the team up against any in the industry.
As to some of the other books and then I'm going to turn it maybe to Kevin. Yeah, I mean in hindsight if you knew
there was going to be a pandemic that would shut down the hotel business, you probably wouldn't make hotel
loans. We like that part of our book, it's 50% to 54% loan-to-value. It's got good operators, mostly franchised. Not
really focused on resort-type properties, a lot of operators that have a lot of experience, a lot of equity, a lot of
external sponsorship. And so short-term, that's certainly going to be a stress book, but one that we think over the
long-term will rebound. We think ours are really well underwritten.
And so, again I'll just touch on a couple of the others. The shopping center you've got the anchored, the grocery
store, the discounts, the pharmacy, those are in good shape with pretty good cash flow and then you've got the
non-anchored where we've got a lot of attention. So I mean, yeah, this is a chance for us to look at everything
we're doing, third-party sponsorships everything that's consuming capital on our books today we're looking at that,
as we go through this crisis making sure that capital isn't consumed long-term by a business that we think doesn't
give us the appropriate return.
So again, we feel good about the book. We feel really good about the senior housing book and those stressed
areas we've got – we referred to it as enhanced monitoring. I can assure you there is enhanced monitoring of
everything in our book. We want to highlight those that you all would find of interest. Kevin, Blair, let me kick to
you for anything else you'd like or Bob Derrick would like to say about that book.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, Kessel I'll start and I'll give Bob a chance to mention some of the actual statistics. But I think Jennifer to
your question, if you think about all of these industries we believe that they're going to return to some level of
normalcy at some point. I mean these are needed services and so many different ways. And the way that we've
thought about them as we underwritten them as we brought them on the books for the years they've been here,
they are lower LTV, higher debt service coverage, borrowers that generally have recourse. And so, we believe
that the short-term nature of this crisis will have an impact. But the long-term viability of many of these industries
are going to return to normal. And in many situations you're going to see revenues pick up, because people have
been social distancing and they are going to be more prone to go in and use these services. So I don't think
there's any second guessing, but to Kessel's point I mean if you knew there was going to be a global pandemic
you might think about so many different industries differently. Bob?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Hi, Jennifer, this is Bob. Just a quick follow-up, I won't belabor it. Kessel is exactly right and so is Kevin. If
you go back and look at these portfolios specifically the CRE portfolios and what it looked like in the previous
crisis in terms of percentage of income producing properties that amount is way up. So we now have a more cash
flow centric book of real estate. The underwriting is obviously comparatively speaking a lot stronger than it was
from an equity coverage perspective in that book. In the C&I space in terms of strategic industries that we want to
evaluate or play in probably nothing materially changes, we like the spaces we're in and the customers we're in
and they generally support our communities where we serve. So I don't think strategically it's going to change us

Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I appreciate all the detail and the color in the slide deck. That was great. Just wanted to kind of follow-up on the
margin discussion. Jamie, I think I heard you say that you may be expected total maybe deposit base in the 30s, if
I heard that correctly. If I look back I think Synovus' interest-bearing deposit costs were around 40 basis points in
2015, 2016, I know that you have Florida Community now with that a little bit higher deposit cost relative to legacy
Synovus. But just looking at a few of the categories, jumbo time, retail times, some of the others, the money
market accounts, do you feel like you've got an opportunity here to really kind of right-size their book with kind of
legacy Synovus and get back to that level? Just kind of curious how you're thinking about the deposit side of
things and the opportunity this might present.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. That's a great question. I mean as we look forward in 2020, we really – we see opportunities to continue
growing core deposits. We have a steady trend there, great performance and we expect that to continue in 2020.
And when you marry that with flat loan growth due to what we've talked about a little bit of shrinking in third-party,
it really does position you well on the deposit side. And so, as we look into the second half of this year and in the
early 2021, we do, we agree with your premise there, that there are opportunities for us to further reduce deposit
costs and we will be looking at that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then just as my follow-up, I'm sorry if I missed it. But just kind of curious, any early indication on the
GreenSky portfolio, kind of what you guys are monitoring there? Just kind of any update that you can give on that
relationship and how you're thinking about it?

Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Hey, Brad. This is Kevin. I'll take that. So look, one of the things we have been monitoring is their level of
deferment. They're a little lower than most of our consumer categories about 5%, so it's holding up well, I know
that that team has been modifying their underwriting criteria on new flow to make sure that they are bringing in the
right type of customer.
But for us, as we've shared in the past, this is really for us a return discussion and today with the waterfall
arrangement that we have there, we still feel very good about that relationship and about those asset classes. But
over time as Jamie has mentioned in terms of capital conservation and making sure we're getting proper returns, I
think you'll see us reduce our appetite in general for third-party purchases and flow arrangements, just so that we
can use our capital for full relationship based opportunities. And so, it will over time become a – in the near term
will become a lower percentage of our balance sheet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Great. And Kevin, it sounds like your approach to the deferrals is a little more strategic rather than wholesale.
Have you seen the pace of those requests remain pretty steady or are they started to tail off at all, just kind of
curious on what your thoughts are, kind of where that...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
...that number of deferrals could head?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
It's a great question because we did see an inflow of deferments – request for deferments very early on. And I
give credit to our line of business leaders, Kevin Howard, Wayne, and Barton Singleton working with our credit
team because any loan greater than $1 million dollars had to go through a credit driven process. So think about it
as like a credit committee where they're going through each individual requests, looking at the underlying aspects
of that bar, gain new information on the financial statements, trying to analyze cash burn, so it's really served the
two functions, number one, helping our customers when they're in need, but two giving us an up-to-date view on
the underlying financial stability of that customer. So, yes, it was I think a well-run process. In terms of the timing
as I said, a lot came in in the first week or two. We've seen it trail off considerably to the point now where we're
really not adding many deferments to that book and just want to make sure that we're clear on it, it's really just a
90 day program.

Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
When you look at Synovus Forward, I know near-term things are kind of moving around. But I think you had
targeted the $100 million of pre-improvement to be realized by year end 2022. Is that timing still on track or has
that been pushed off?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Our commitment remains to the $100 million, but you're right that the timing has been adjusted. The beauty of this
strategy is that we started and we did a lot of diagnostic work, a lot of work in 2019 to determine what were
effective possible initiatives to help us get better. And we had a list of about 25 different initiatives that we looked
at, and then we prioritized a subset of those. We've talked about in the past – in the past, we've talked about 8 to
10 initiatives. We actually have about 16 in slide right now, and so – but as we look at those we have shifted. We
have some initiatives that are full steam ahead, still at the same page as we originally thought. We had some that
we said you know what we need and we need to step back in this crisis environment it's not the best time, so let's
pause on those. And then there are other ones that we've accelerated. But the net impact of that to us and to the
financials is that the benefit will be delayed. And so the benefits that we expected to start seeing come in at the
end of 2020 will be in 2021. And so, you're right, we will see a little bit of a delay in the impact of those on
expenses.
The only thing I would add to that before handing to Kevin to give more insight into Synovus Forward is that our
forecast for expenses in 2020 is the same as it was in January, it's just we're getting there in a different way. So in
January when we talked about it, we had that benefit of Synovus Forward coming in in the second half of the
year, reducing expenses, improving efficiency. But now the reduction in expenses is more due to declines in
business activity in this environment, we haven't just had natural operating leverage that allows us to reduce
expenses. And so, our expense outlook is the same, but to your point, the impact of Synovus Forward is the way.
Kevin?

Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Brady, I think Jamie covered it well. Just I'll highlight one activity that Jamie mentioned just in terms of one
of our bigger initiatives was on the third-party services. And we've continued to work that initiative throughout the
crisis. And I'm pleased I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we are actually increasing the expected benefit
from that program. So although we're delaying some things there are other projects that have been accelerated
and they are actually bearing better fruit than we had expected. So to Jamie's point, we're going to get here, it's
just going to be on a slightly delayed basis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. That's helpful. If you look at your stock that trades at almost an 8% dividend yield, Jamie I heard your
comments that there's no expected change in the dividend at this time. But maybe just expand further on the
safety and the stability of the common dividend here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. As we think about our dividend policy and how we think about, it's really a function of two things. First and
foremost, capital adequacy, right. And as we've said, we remain very confident in our capital adequacy. We're
well positioned. We run a myriad of stress tests, we feel very good there. The second thing is forecasted long-
term earnings. We believe that our payout ratio target to long-term forecasted earnings of 35% to 40% is
appropriate. But in this economic environment, it's really difficult for any company to forecast long-term earnings.
And so, we continuously evaluate our dividend and our long-term earnings forecast to ensure that our payout ratio
remains aligned with our objectives. And so, based on those factors and how we see everything today, we believe
our dividend is appropriate, but as we go through the crisis we'll continually evaluate it.

Hey, Kevin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Just a quick question on, I know the obvious focus here is on reserve building and you guys took an aggressive
step this quarter and you implied that it's possible there may be more reserve building to come next quarter. But
as we would probably suspect that as we get later in the year maybe that's when losses start emerging. And when
you think about the reserves you're establishing now, do you think in terms of utilizing those, in other words,
there's going to be some point of letting that reserve bleed down as opposed to matching those net charge-offs
when they come, and is that just how you're thinking about it going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, I mean as we think about our allowance for credit losses, I mean it is our best estimate at life of loan losses
of our loan portfolio. And so, we had that build this quarter that we believe positions us well, 1.39% allowance to
loan ratio, ACL to loan ratio, we feel is strong and it reflects a pretty severe environment. As I said on the call, we
do think that some of the forecasts you have seen in April are more severe. And so, there may be further build
from here, but you are right that as you go through this basically CECL forces you to frontload those losses and
so you take that expense earlier in the cycle and that's exactly what we're seeing right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up. I know there were a couple of questions before on PPP and in terms
of the impact of that over the next few quarters that we would see balances go up in second quarter or maybe
presumably come down in third quarter and there's a dilutive impact to the margin that you referred to in the
second quarter, maybe that comes off in third quarter. The origination fee, should we expect that to come
theoretically through the margin as a benefit in third quarter? And then I believe you referred to a dollar amount of
expenses, I don't know if it was related to PPP or just generally. But are there going to be expenses related to this
program in the second and/or third quarter? And just trying to gauge of that origination fee when it flows through,
how much would conceivably fall to the bottom line versus bonuses for your employees and such?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. We mentioned COVID related expenses, so we kind of grouped more things in it than just P3 and that was
$5 million to $6 million in the second quarter. You're spot on with the accounting treatment as we see it for the
fees and that it flows through interest income. And you're right, when forgiveness happens that we will realize the
fee. And so, there would likely be a spike. To us, it's uncertain how that forgiveness process will play out. So,
you're right it could be the third quarter, it could be later, it could come in overtime, but that is exactly how it works.
You know you're right we have expenses with the P3 program. We have an army of volunteers that are working
all hours of the day. There used to be a saying about bankers hours being nine to three, I'm convinced right now
that bankers hours are 24/7. Folks are working around the clock to deliver P3 to Synovus customers. And so
we're pretty excited about that, but I would say the expenses associated with P3 are fairly minimal.

Tyler Stafford Q

Hey good morning guys and thanks for taking the questions.

Tyler Stafford Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey, Good morning. I hopped on pretty late, so I apologize if you guys have already covered this. But I just had a
question about the uptick in the non-accruals those were up, I think around a little over 50% quarter-over-quarter.
How much of that was to the reclass from PCI to PCD? And can you just talk about kind of the underlying I guess
core trends excluding that noise if there was any?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Hey, Tyler, this is Bob. I'll try to give you a flavor for that. It was slightly related to the backing out of or
moving away from the acquired purchased accounting on the gross up of non-accruals. We also had a specific
credit that we had previously identified, it did move to non-accrual, and the credit secured and it has an
impairment reserve, but that's a net number as well. To your question more strategically about these levels, as
Jamie mentioned, I mean the broader credit metrics, we still feel really good about the level of non-accruals and
the other credit metrics in that book, the credit cost for the quarter, we did have were not systemic, they were not
in any specific market or any specific line of business. So, the answer to your more overall question is, the levels
are just pretty low 41 bps on NPL compares favorably to a year ago basically about the same number. So, we feel
good about these levels on where they are, we look a step back and analyze our past due ratios and other early
warning indicators that we have, and all of those numbers seem to be favorable as well. So, kind of going into the
crisis, as consistent with a lot of others, credit was in really pretty good shape.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tyler Stafford Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Thank you for that. I appreciate it. And then I know you touched on some near-term fee income guidance, I
think for the second quarter. And again, apologize if we missed it. But what's the fee waivers that you'd expect to
see in 2Q or provide in 2Q given the COVID related?

Kevin Blair A

Yes. Tyler this is Kevin. So we've had less than $1 million of fee waivers to-date. And so, it's going to be in that
range, it's not a material amount. We're doing it on an as requested basis, so we're not just providing fee waivers
across the board. So at this point it's minimal. We'll continue to monitor that, but it's less than $1 million.

Jared Shaw Q

Just circling back on the expenses. I guess the $5 million to $6 million that's incremental expenses that's
anticipated to come in second quarter or that is in the first quarter number? So, I guess should we be looking at
that – sorry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. That's a second quarter number. So our guidance on expenses is, we will be flat quarter-on-quarter and
first quarter to the second quarter, and that's inclusive of the $5 million to $6 million of COVID related expenses.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then assuming sort of everything starts opening up again, those aren't necessarily repeated in third
quarter come out, and then are we seeing additional expense cuts beyond that, or is that a really driving the
backend to lower expenses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
No, no, no. It's not driving the back end. Those are – the largest line in that COVID related expense is the $50 a
day bonus we're giving to our front line associates. And so, yes, you're right, that will go away at some point, we'll
have lower expenses in the second half of the year, really due to the changing kind of economic activity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then just looking at the allowance in the qualitative growth you saw this quarter. If we sort of end the
quarter where we are today, should we expect to see a similarly sized qualitative growth in second quarter just
with the deterioration since March 31st?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Yeah. Good question. The qualitative should be a little bit unique. If you recall at the end of March, every
week, majors, the Wall Street economists, rating agency economists, they were updating their forecast really on a
weekly basis and you're seeing tremendous change in every week the outlook for the economy. And what
happened is we had approved our economic forecast on March 20th and by the time we got to March 31st, we
realized that the outlook had significantly changed. And so, we went back and layered in that qualitative overlays
really for the delta between March 28th and March 31st. And so that should not be a continuous adjustment. The
only thing I would add though is that model – in this environment, model efficacy is difficult because of the
stimulus programs. It's hard to say what the impact of spiking unemployment really will be with these stimulus
programs. And so, I would say that the first quarter qualitative is unique. However, we will always look at the
outputs of our models and make sure they're appropriate.

Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Hey, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Just a clarification on that last question on the qualitative. When you say that that's unique, are you implying that
it's not likely to be as large or just not likely to occur at all because you've already adjusted for the change in the
macro backdrop in the April versus what we saw at the end of March?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
I think I understand your question. You're asking – so at the end of March we had our economic forecast. And so
if you want to think just to put kind of round numbers on that you have unemployment – the scenario of 1.39%
allowance for credit losses represents a scenario where unemployment will go higher than 9%, big declines in
GDP. However since then, if you look at most of these economic output or forecast, they are more severe than
that. And so should – when we do this in the end of June, if our base case is what do you see from some of the
Wall Street shop today, it's likely we will have a further build in the second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Right. Okay. All right and then to frame that longer term I guess, wanted to see if you can help us think about how
you look at through cycle loss content in your portfolio given a crisis like this. I think the last time you had
disclosed the DFAS data it was before Florida Community understandably, but maybe you're looking at about...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
... $838 million in through-cycle losses at that point. So how do you think about it now? Can you give us some
idea of when you run this analysis, what you're coming up with in terms of through cycle loss content?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. So the DFAS results that you're referring to has a 3.6% losses, and if we looked at it – if we were – when
we run our severe adverse stress losses, right now for eight quarter loss the 3.6% still holds and that's another
thing that we've looked at, when we look at our allowance for credit losses at 1.39%, we're right around 40%
those eight quarter severe adverse losses, and we think that that makes sense. And it's in line with what we're
seeing from other peers and other large banks. And so we do that comparison as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. All right. Thanks. No, that's helpful. And then one other follow-up on the reserve were the at-risk portfolios
that you flagged, you have the amount of allocated reserve to these portfolios?

Good morning, Ken.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I guess just wanted to ask about the sort of how you're thinking about the CECL reserves, specifically in terms of
the two year versus the one year reasonable and supportable period? And I guess specifically by moving to a one
year forecast period and then kind of assuming everything goes back to normal after that or reserve back to
normal, does that reduce your CECL reserve versus if you had taken a two year forward look using some of the
economic data that you're talking about?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
You know Ken, we made that decision, when you look at the economic forecasts that are out there and we looked
at pretty much all of them, you see a large decline here in the near term in the second quarter, third quarter, and
then you see a bounce back and really when you look at the two year cumulative GDP, in all these scenarios, you
get to down 2%, down 5%. And so, we thought as we look at this, first, there was extreme uncertainty, the
forecasts were all over the place and our ability to forecast for two years, it was just – it's not there to see that far
forward. And so we adjusted, went to one year, it's something that we had planned for in an adverse environment,
but that's why we did it. If you look at the impact of the one from two years to one year, it's really hard to quantify
because of the adjustment we did with the qualitative factor that really – that gets us back to where we likely
would have been otherwise.

Got it. Okay. And then just as a follow-up really quick one. In terms of the CET1 ratio, is there a level that you just
absolutely don't want to drop below or maybe at the same level where regulators might start asking pointed
questions? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Well, we can't comment on regulatory aspects of that. I mean look, in our capital adequacy effort, and our work
we do, we have scenarios where we see capital [indiscernible] (01:10:36) in severe adverse scenarios. Obviously,
we have it going down approximately 2% in severe adverse, but we feel good about where we are today. When
you look at that, we are constantly looking at this and looking at the scenarios in light of the balance sheet and the
risk in the balance sheet and credit metrics. And so, I would say there's no hard and fast number. I mean, we
obviously have a risk appetite. We obviously have ranges that pushes to different decisions, but those aren't all
public.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Garrett Anthony Holland Q
Analyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Good morning. And thanks for taking the questions. I appreciate the detail on the appendix of the deck on all the
different COVID portfolios. But just wanted to follow-up on how you're thinking about the potential loss severities
for these portfolios and the collateral protection that limits any downtime.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Okay. So first of all back to the earlier comment on just trying to put a separate reserve in for these, we don't talk
about that because the models largely formulate a view on the severity based on the underlying economics and
obviously the models are going to project some sort of loss on that. As it relates to the portfolios themselves,
obviously what sort of loss content will be determined as we said earlier in terms of the severity and the length the
revenue shortfalls, and so, we model those and we look at those that's part of the reason we've been doing the
individual deferment assessments and we look at cash burns for each of these respective customers and trying to
make an assessment for what the duration and how long they have in terms of cushions and protection. So it's
very difficult to say within any of those industries what the loss content will be. There's a lot of uncertainty, a lot of
factors that drive that. Bob, I don't know if you would add anything to it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, Garrett, just a quick follow-up. This is Bob. I would just say that, as we go through our evaluation process of
deferment exits, as these credits begin to come out of our deferment portfolios, certainly then we'll get to evaluate
kind of where the revenue accretion they can get back, make an assessment of how quickly. But generally
speaking we're staying with sort of the risk rating as they go through the deferment process and then as we begin
to graduate credits out, we'll make further assessments and begin to build our models on loss content. I know

that's the question everybody want to know, the loss content in these identified portfolios, but we're modeling that,
and we'll begin to do that as we bring these loans out of deferment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Garrett Anthony Holland Q
Analyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Thanks Kevin. Thanks Bob. And just had a follow-up on asset quality. I guess what are you seeing in the legacy
FCB portfolio at this point? And what if any is remaining of the unamortized loan mark and what does that mean
from a pro forma reserve coverage?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Hey Garrett, this is Bob again. I'll just start and see if anybody else wants to jump in. Just a couple of quick
comments, maybe if I could take a step back. We started due diligence in that legacy FCB book almost two years
ago this summer. A lot of those – and as you recall that was a wholesale type of book with not a lot of what we
would call legacy smaller business credits in there. So it's been almost two years since the Synovus team has
been in there. We've gone through a number of renewals. There's been external and internal exams. So my point
in telling you all that is, I do believe we've kind of graduated this portfolio into the Synovus portfolio and we feel
pretty good about where we are in terms of the market itself and Jamie or Kevin could probably speak to the
accounting. But the mark was more than adequate. We didn't get the losses, it was more than adequate to cover.
So we've kind of graduated beyond that sort of legacy FCB, legacy Synovus approach, and we like to think of it as
one market and we feel really good about the credit metrics that we are seeing relatively speaking out of our
Florida portfolio. Recall Garrett, it is about a third of our book of business when you look at it from a state wide
basis, so that tells some general comments about how we look at that portfolio. Kevin, I don't know whether you
want to follow.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
I mean just from a business perspective, I mean, we continue to grow in that South Florida marketplace, it
represents a big percentage of our growth, and those loans are similar loans to what they've been doing in the
past and as we said in another calls in general the portfolio that we acquired from FCB and what was there today
performs at a better level than the aggregate credit metrics of Synovus in total. So, we continue to be very
pleased with the credit quality there.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2020
Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just first question on your $2 billion PPP, was that all
with your clients and do you have an industry breakout of that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kessel D. Stelling A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Steven, it was a mix, it was primarily clients, but gosh if it's early on, I really won't may be talk about other banks,
but let's just say our team stood up our portal quickly, a very efficient process, the large majority of applicants
were customers because of a lot of reasons, obviously your customer and other policies, you really could process
in more quickly, however in a lot of our markets given I'll just say frustration with maybe a customer's other
banking partner, we did see great opportunity. And in fact I think our small business, new deposit accounts in the
first couple of weeks in April hit record levels, I don't have that detail in front of me, but hit record levels as
customers of other banks established banking relationships in order to then apply as a customer.
So Kevin, you may want to say more, but I'd say large majority customer, but a lot of new customers that just felt
like and I've been really deluged with letters of thanks from new and old. I will say this though, on the PPP
program, we're not celebrating or high-fiving the fact that we've put $2 billion out is, I've said to our team and
Kevin and the great people that are working 24/7, really there's no cause for celebration until the last application
in our queue gets processed, we can't guarantee funding. We don't know how long this next appropriation will
last, but for every one who's really happy we know there are others that are waiting.
So again we'll hopefully – I mean I've heard different indicators today of when the ETRAN portal may open back
up, it seems like most people are pointing towards Monday, we were hopeful that it would happen before then
because we were ready. And again, we'll – celebrate is probably not the right word, because in this environment
we're not celebrating. But I can tell you our team is passionate and determined to get that last one through our
queue. Kevin, you may have some more on the customer, new customer breakout.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, no Kessel you nailed it. It's about – it's 95% existing customers, we did bring in some non-customers who
came in. And just as from an industry standpoint it's just as you would expect it's going to follow some of those
other industries, our top industry is only a combination in food service side, the arts and entertainment, recreation,
some physician services are higher as well as retail trade. So ironically it follows some of those industries we
mentioned earlier in terms of the enhanced monitoring.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
That's really great to hear. And then just a follow-up. Just on the loan deferrals. I don't know if I missed it, is there
a number and amounts of the loan deferrals?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Blair A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yes. So we said it's about 13% of our entire books, so it's less than $5 billion and it's a little less than a 11,000
notes and I think what's important to note there is of those 11,000 notes 93% of them are on the under $1 million
side. So as we've talked about our process under a $1 million were more of an automated process, over a $1
million went through our credit driven process so 93% of the deferments were on the under $1 million and then
has 7% over a $1 million and that was really spread out amongst CRE and C&I and some of our private wealth
loans.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2020
Kessel D. Stelling A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Hey, Steven, that's a great question and the answer is maybe yes. Now just to be clear all of our branches are
also operating as appointment-only. We just need to know who we're admitting, control how many come in, and
make sure that they're properly distanced. But not just to the branches, to our whole way of doing business, yeah
absolutely, I think we could look at – because you know what, our team has responded remarkably. But so have
our customers and other than maybe some complaints about longer waits in call centers which we don't like, as it
relates to our branch service, our customers have adapted well and then lots of notes about the use of the drive-
through and the appointment-only and gotten the special treatment they get that way. So as we go further and I
was going to segue into Synovus Forward and look at branch rationalization, I think Wayne Akins and his team
are looking at how we have served customers, what's the right staffing model going forward and what's the right
physical capacity going forward.
And just on Synovus Forward, I actually want to come back to one thing Kevin commented on, I think Brady, you
asked about the timing of the expense and revenue and I want to take full blame for any delay in timing as we
went into this crisis, I said to our team one day, I don't want to see any more consultants in the building, in
Columbus, in Atlanta, distracting our team from what needs to happen, and then quickly we realized that our effort
really needed to be focused on again what we said are two guiding principles were, the physical and financial
security of our team. And again the same thing for our customers and their safety.
So we paused it, but I can tell you to Steven's question and others, I believe it's been an eye opener to our team
about how we can do business differently. And so, while Synovus Forward paused, Kevin mentioned
procurement, we are also again vetting all of our initial thoughts and throwing new ones onto the table because of
again the way we change. So Steven that was a long answer, but the branch system has worked very well with
drive-through and appointment and it certainly is allowing us to think about again number of physical locations
and levels of staffing to support what we've been supporting.

Well, thank you. And as we close the call I just want to once again thank our team members for all they continue
to do for our company and our customers. They are facing new challenges and opportunities almost daily in this
unusual environment. It's truly amazing to watch them successfully and gracefully handle each one always doing
what's best for each other, for our customers and our communities.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2020
I know Kevin Fitzsimmons ask about the cost related to PPP and there will be costs related to overtime, related to
all that we're doing with bonus, but there's also probably a cost of weariness and working 24/7. I've seen team
members holding babies at 3 AM as they input PPP loan with one hand, so the dollar cost maybe one thing, the
physical cost in our team is probably a little more severe. But I can tell you every hour I get multiple emails from
team members telling me how incredibly proud they are, to be a part of the company. So thanks to the team and
to our customers again who've been incredibly patient, flexible as we modified the way, we serve them just know
that we're committed to doing all we can do to minimize your inconvenience, and just we want thank you for
allowing us to be your banking partner and apologize for any inconveniences you faced and then to our
shareholders. Both those new and those that have been with us long-term through other economic ebbs and
flows, we thank you for your continued trust in us.
So with that operator we'll close the call. We want to thank everybody for their participation and interest at our
company. Please stay safe and we look forward to talking to you in the very near future. Thank you.

Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now
disconnect.
