Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I hope you and your families are healthy and coping
well during this unprecedented time.
Today, we reported earnings of $0.80 per share. The highlight of the quarter was very strong loan and deposit
growth, which drove balances to record highs and partly offset the impact of lower interest rates on net interest
income. Overall, credit quality remained solid. However, with the unprecedented, rapid decline in the economy
and high level of uncertainty, we again prudently increased our credit reserves. Capital levels continued to be
strong and our book value per share grew to over $53.
We have quickly adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic and are continuing to make adjustments as the crisis
evolves. With over 55% of our colleagues working from home, the health and safety of our employees and
customers remain our top priority. For those who cannot work from home, in our operations areas and banking
[indiscernible] (00:02:38) locations, we are making precautions to minimize health risk and have provided
enhanced COVID-19 related benefits. Across the bank, our colleagues have continued to ensure that our
customers are well taken care of, consistent with our long-standing relationship banking focus.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2020
Our team has worked diligently to support our customers providing sound financial advice, credit expertise and
payment flexibility where needed. I am proud of the tremendous dedication our colleagues have displayed in
supporting the Paycheck Protection Program. I'm extremely thankful for the unwavering commitment of our
Comerica team and I am honored to serve as CEO during these challenging times.
Helping our customers and communities endure stressful situations and achieve long-term success is at the heart
of Comerica's relationship banking strategy. As we've previously announced, we have significantly increased our
financial commitment to serve our communities. Comerica, together with Comerica Charitable Foundation, have
pledged $8 million to nonprofit organizations that care for and provide critical services to our communities. This
includes more than $3 million to community development, financial institutions and other business development
nonprofits as well as a recent $1 million commitment to the National Business League to assist black-owned small
businesses.
Our loan growth in the second quarter further demonstrates the support we have provided our customers.
Average loans increased $3.9 billion with growth in the majority of our businesses including $2.6 billion in PPP
loans which provided needed liquidity to middle market and small business customers.
The strength of our customer relationships was also evidenced with broad based growth in average deposits of
$7.5 billion. Noninterest-bearing deposits grew $5.9 billion. Government stimulus programs have resulted in
tremendous liquidity.
In addition, as we have seen in other times of economic uncertainty, both retail and commercial customers are
conserving cash in the safety of their Comerica accounts.
As expected, the decline in interest rates had an impact on net interest income. In this ultra-low rate environment,
we continue to carefully manage loan and deposit pricing to attract and maintain customer relationships.
Comerica has a long history of prudent credit underwriting which has allowed us to manage through many
economic cycles. Despite the current period of unprecedented disruption, our portfolio has performed well, and
while we have seen some negative migration, it has thus far been manageable.
Nevertheless, there remains a great deal of uncertainty about the duration and severity of the impacts related to
COVID-19. After taking a large provision in the first quarter, we further increased our credit reserves to over $1
billion or 2.15% excluding the SBA-guaranteed PPP loans. We are staying close to our customers and are
working to address their needs. At this point, we believe our reserves are appropriate and that we are well-
positioned.
With regard to noninterest income, we saw a growth of 4% quarter-over-quarter with our strong card franchise
being a major contributor. Overall, we have continued to maintain our expense discipline. However, COVID-19-
related expenses, as well as external card processing costs, resulted in an increase in expenses for the quarter.
Capital remains strong and we further bolstered our Tier 1 ratio by issuing $400 million in preferred stock. We
remain focused on maintaining our attractive dividend and deploying our capital to support growth.
Recent conversations I've had with employees and customers reflect the challenges of the current environment,
especially as we have seen an uptick in COVID-19 cases. However, while it is very difficult to predict the path
forward, I sense longer-term optimism based on the country's overall economic resiliency. I continue to be

inspired by the spirit and determination demonstrated by my Comerica colleagues, our customers and the many
communities we serve.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Jim to review the quarter in more detail.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Thanks, Curt, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 4, average loans increased $3.9 billion or 8% in the
second quarter. Average loans in our Mortgage Banker business, which serves mortgage companies, were at an
all-time high, increasing $1.2 billion due to very strong refi activity and seasonal spring home sales.
As far as Corporate Banking, you may recall that large companies began to draw down lines late in the first
quarter to build liquidity buffers in a time of great uncertainty. Those advances have begun to decline, but the full
quarter effect contributed to a $767 million increase to Corporate Banking average balances.
General Middle Market increased $737 million and Business Banking increased $567 million, aided by PPP loan
fundings. Also, Commercial Real Estate loan growth continued, driven by multi-family projects where we work
with proven developers who provide substantial equity upfront. Providing a partial offset to the strong growth,
loans decreased at National Dealer with lower inventory levels as expected.
Period-end loans were stable and very close to the record $53.5 billion reported March 31. Increases in loans to
small business and a peak in Mortgage Banker loans at quarter end were offset by lower National Dealer
balances and customers reducing working capital needs and leverage in the uncertain environment.
Line utilization decreased to just over 49%, mainly due to the drop in National Dealer usage. Commitments
decreased about $300 million with increases in Corporate Banking and General Middle Market more than offset
by declines in Energy, Equity Fund Services and Mortgage Banker.
Loan yields were 3.26%, a decrease of 93 basis points from the first quarter. This was mostly a result of lower
interest rates. One-month LIBOR, the rate we are most sensitive to, declined 105 basis points. In addition, lower
yielding PPP loans weighed on our total loan yield. This was partly offset [ph] by the offsetting (00:09:27) actions
we are taking, particularly adding LIBOR [ph] in force (00:09:28) when possible [indiscernible] (00:09:32).
Deposits increased 13% or $7.5 billion as shown on slide 5, with growth in nearly every business line. As Curt
mentioned, customers are prudently conserving and maintaining excess cash balances. Period-end deposits
increased $10.4 billion led by General Middle Market, Business Banking, Corporate Banking, and Retail. Deposit
growth outpaced loan growth, resulting in a decline to our loan-to-deposit ratio to 79% and helped increase
balances [indiscernible] (00:10:03) to over $12 billion at quarter end.
The average cost of interest-bearing deposits was 26 basis points, a decrease of 50 basis points from the first
quarter. Our prudent management of relationship pricing in a lower rate environment, our large proportion of
noninterest-bearing deposits, as well as the floating rate nature of our wholesale funding, drove our total funding
cost to only 22 basis points for the quarter.
As you can see on slide 6, the yield on the MBS portfolio declined just a couple of basis points, helped by the fact
that in the first quarter as rates began to fall, we opportunistically pre-purchased a portion of second quarter
expected payments. Yields on recent purchases have been around 130 basis points. We had a moderate
increase in prepaids in the second quarter. However, this did not have a significant impact on the portfolio's [ph]

duration (00:10:57) or the unamortized premium, which remains relatively small. We expect payments to range in
the $900 million to $950 million per quarter range for the near-term. We are considering opportunistically putting
some of our excess liquidity to work by increasing the portfolio as market conditions allow.
Turn to slide 7, net interest income declined $42 million to $471 million and the net interest margin was 2.50%, a
decline of 56 basis points relative to the first quarter. The major drivers for the negative net impact of lower rates,
which totaled $67 million or 37 basis points in the margin, as well as an increase in excess liquidity, which
reduced the margin by 17 basis point.
Interest income on loans decline to $83 million and reduced the margin 60 basis points. Lower interest rates on
loans alone had an impact of $105 million and 57 basis points on the margin. There was a $2 million or 1 basis
point impact from lower nonaccrual interest activity.
Higher balances add $15 million and fees on the margin added $7 million. Over half of the combined increase in
volume and fees was related to PPP loans, which had a net negative impact of 3 basis points on the margin.
Other portfolio dynamics contributed $2 million of 1 basis point, which mainly reflected our success in adding
LIBOR force to loans.
Interest on deposits of the Fed had a $15 million negative impact or 26 basis points on the margin. The lower Fed
fund's interest rate reduced net interest income by $16 million or 9 basis points in the margin. Higher balances of
the Fed added $1 million but resulted in a 17 basis point drag in the margin. Deposit costs declined by $36 million
and added 19 basis points to the margin, primarily a result of our prudent management of deposit pricing as
interest rates declined, as I previously discussed.
Finally, with lower rate and, to a lesser extent, lower balances, wholesale funding costs declined by $20 million,
adding 11 basis points to the margin. In the third quarter, we will received the full quarter benefit of the June
maturity of $675 million in senior debt and made a repayment of $500 million in FHLB advances, as well as a
further planned reduction of $1 billion in FHLB advances. As a reminder, given the nature of our portfolio, our
loans reprice very quickly. Also, we continue to closely monitor the competitive environment and our liquidity
position as we manage deposit pricing.
Overall credit quality was solid as shown on slide 8. Net charge-offs were $50 million or 37 basis points and only
$5 million or 4 basis points excluding Energy loans. We continue to work closely with our customers, carefully
reviewing their current and projected financial performance and adjusting risk ratings as appropriate. This is
reflected in the $922 million increase in criticized loans.
General Middle Market criticized loans increased $519 million, primarily related to the migration of leverage, auto
and social distancing loans as expected. Energy criticized loans increased $348 million. The total criticized portion
of the portfolio remains low at 6% of loans. Nonperforming loans also remained low at 51 basis points, a modest
increase over the first quarter. Excluding Energy, nonperforming loans decreased. In summary, we started the
cycle from a position of strength with very low nonperforming and criticized loans and migration so far has been
manageable.
Turning to slide 9, as far as the amounts, the economy improved for the quarter. However, it does remain weak
and the outlook continues to be uncertain with the unprecedented impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly
related to social distancing. Our CECL modeling includes significant recession we have been experiencing
followed by a slow recovery. More severe assumptions were used in the qualitative adjustments made for certain
segments. This resulted in an increase in our allowance for credit losses to $1.1 billion. Our credit reserve ratio

was 2.15% excluding PPP loans, which were guaranteed by the SBA, so carry variable risk, and the majority are
expected to be forgiven over the next six months.
Our current reserve coverage for NPLs was strong at 3.9 times. Again, we are well positioned with the relatively
high credit reserve and low nonperforming assets as illustrated. We believe our disciplined underwriting diverse
portfolio and deep expertise will assist us in managing through this pandemic recession.
Energy loans, which are outlined on slide 10, were $2.1 billion at quarter-end and represent 4% of our total loans.
E&P loans make up about 80% of the energy portfolio and energy services, which is considered the riskiest
segment, was only $50 million.
The allocation of loan reserves to energy loans remained above 10%, as fluctuating oil and gas prices have
resulted in increases in criticized and nonaccrual loans. However, charge-offs decreased quarter-over-quarter.
Spring redeterminations are 90% complete and on average, borrowing bases have declined 20%. As we have
done through previous cycles, we aim to work with our customers to cure deficiencies through repayment over
time.
In general, our E&P customers have less leverage than the last energy downturn, are hedged to varying degrees,
and are acting prudently, cutting costs and reducing CapEx in order to preserve liquidity. With more than 40 years
of serving this industry, we have deep expertise and remain focused on working with our energy customers as
they navigate this cycle.
Slide 11 provides detail in segments that we believe pose higher risk in the current environment. We've seen only
limited negative migration in the social distancing segment and we applied a more severe economic forecast.
Therefore, we believe we are well-reserved for these loans. Also note that this segment is relatively granular and
our exposure to any one of these industries is not significant.
Our automotive reduction exposure primarily consists of loans to Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers. Many of these
customers experienced disruptions in manufacturing. However, production has begun to ramp up. We have deep
expertise and a long history of working in this cyclical sector. While nonaccrual loans are only $1 million, criticized
loans have increased, and as a result, we increased the reserve allocation. Ultimately, we believe losses will be
manageable.
Leveraged loans are where you often see the first indication of stress. While balances are stable, criticized loans
increased as expected. Our leveraged loans tend to be Middle Market relationship-based customers, with
sponsors, management teams and industries we know well. Also, our sweet spot would be at a lower end of the
[ph] larger (00:18:20) spectrum and we avoid the highly leveraged covenant-like deals that have been more
prevalent in the industry in recent years.
As for payment deferrals and forbearance, we have granted deferral requests for more than 2,000 customers,
totaling $4.5 billion in loans, with substantially all considered performing at the time of deferral. Over the past
month, new requests including requests for a second deferral have been nominal.
Non-interest income increased $10 million as outlined in slide 12. This included deferred comp asset returns of $2
million, a $5 million increase from last quarter, which is offset in non-interest expenses. Card fees were very
strong and increased $9 million due to higher transaction volume related to stimulus programs and changes in
customer behavior. Securities trading income increased $8 million, reflecting fair market adjustments for

investments we hold related to our Technology & Life Sciences business. There were also increases in securities
gains as well as customer derivative income which included a lower credit valuation adjustment.
On the other hand, poor economic conditions weighed on several fee categories. Deposit service charges
declined $7 million with reduced cash management activity. Lower money market rates weighed on brokerage
and fiduciary income and foreign exchange activity decreased with the decline in economic activity.
Turning to expenses on slide 13, salaries and benefits increased $7 million with annual merit and additional
compensation paid to colleagues who are not able to work remotely or worked overtime on BBB loans.
Deferred comp increased $5 million as I mentioned on the previous slide. This is partially offset by a seasonal
decrease in payroll taxes. Outside processing increased $5 million primarily related to higher card transaction
volume and BBB loan initiation. We continue to invest for the future and prepare for the return to normalcy while
maintaining our expense discipline.
Comerica's conservative approach to capital and liquidity has positioned us well to navigate the current
environment. Our capital levels remained strong with an estimated CET1 of 9.97% as shown on slide 14.
In the second quarter, we issued $400 million in preferreds. This was the next logical step in optimizing our capital
base adding approximately 60 basis points to our Tier 1 ratio which is our binding constraint. We opportunistically
took advantage of market conditions and received a very strong response reflected on the favorable pricing of
5.625%.
Earlier this year, our board increased our dividend to $0.68 per share and declared that level for the July 1
dividend payment. As the dividend is determined, careful consideration is given to expected earnings power and
capital needs to support loan growth and investment in our businesses. The current dividend yield is very
attractive and is supported by the strong holding company cash position. We also conduct robust capital stress
test to help ensure our dividend can withstand cyclical pressures as we are experiencing now while we maintain
strong capital levels for the CET1 target of 10%.
Slide 15 provides our outlook for the third quarter relative to the second quarter. We are assuming recessionary
conditions remain with continued slow improvement in GDP and unemployment. However, a high degree of
uncertainty remains regarding the economic impact of COVID-19.
Loans to small businesses are expected to reflect the full quarter benefit of the PPP advances as it ramped up
early in the second quarter, and we anticipate only modest loan forgiveness in the third quarter. More than
offsetting this, we expect loan growth to be challenging in a few business lines. Mortgage Banker is expected to
reflect lower refi volumes from record second quarter levels as well as seasonality in home sales.
Also, we expect continued reduction of liquidity draws by Large Corporates and lower National Dealer balances
as auto inventory levels decline further. We expect average deposits to be stable as some customers utilize their
economic stimulus payments while others work to conserve cash. The net impact from rates alone on net interest
income is estimated to be $10 million to $15 million in the third quarter relative to the second quarter. This
includes the full quarter effects that lower interest rates partly offset by our action to decrease deposit rates which
we expect to average 20 basis points in the third quarter. Reduced loan volume is expected to roughly offset a
reduction of wholesale borrowings and additional day in the quarter.

Credit quality is expected to refund the economic environment. With our solid credit metrics and our credit reserve
at about 2% of loans for the second quarter, we believe we are well-positioned. However, the path of the
economy is uncertain.
We expect noninterest income to decline, primarily due to the unusually high second quarter levels for securities
trading income, derivative income, card and deferred comp, which are not expected to repeat. Also, we believe
lower market-related activity should have an impact on investment banking and fiduciary fees. Partly offsetting
this as the economy improves, we expect an increase in areas such as deposit service charges as commercial
activity picks up.
We expect a rise in technology and occupancy expenses as we catch up on initiatives that have been delayed
due to COVID-19. We are committed to investing in our future so that we are well-positioned coming out of the
pandemic. In addition, we expect an increase in charitable giving and seasonal increases in staff insurance and
marketing. These costs will be mostly offset by our continued focus on controlling expenses as we are closely
managing discretionary spending and expect COVID-related costs to decline.
As far as capital, I mentioned in the previous slide we expect to declare our first dividend on the preferred stock of
about $8 million, which includes a [ph] step period (00:24:37) from the second quarter. Our capital levels are
healthy and we remain focused on managing our capital with the goal of providing an attractive return to our
shareholders.
Now I'll turn the call back to Curt.

Good.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Wanted to – maybe just if we can clarify if you can, on slide 15, the guidance for net interest income, I just want to
make sure I really understand what you're saying there, because obviously the rates is a negative, totally got it,
there's a negative sign there. There's also a negative sign against – ahead of the lower loan balances which are
offset by the lower debt, etcetera. So, net-net, it sounds like NII is going down from here. But can you just help us
understand the – can you quantify maybe what the lower loan balance part might be? I'm just trying to get a
sense, are we talking – because you do say it's offset, but are we talking down $1 million or down $20 million?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks for the question. We – that's going to be somewhat dependent on PPP loan volume and when
those prepay. So there is a range of outcomes there.
But just to give you a general feel for where it could end up, we're looking at probably $10 million to $12 million in
terms of reduced volume impact. And that should be roughly offset, as we mentioned, by the one additional day
and the lower wholesale debt. And there's probably kind of a plus or minus $3 million or $4 million to that
depending on where PPP volume goes. But hopefully that boxes the range in for you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. That actually does help quite a bit. So, thank you on that. I guess maybe just a second question. In
terms of operating expenses, your expenses have been fairly stable I would say over the last few quarters.
Several of the other banks that I cover have seen sharp declines in expenses, whether it's lower travel or
marketing or even incentive compensation. Can you just remind us, is there anything different in terms of how
you're approaching the expenses for the business where you might not be seeing that same level of benefit?

Because I'm assuming you're not traveling anymore, or very little travel now, whereas other banks might be
seeing a bit more of that benefit. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Ken. We are seeing some pockets of lower expenses just like I think some of our peer banks are. I would
point out to a couple of key differences between us and perhaps some of our peers. Of course, you need to
discount the $5 million of deferred comp expense, which is offset in noninterest income.
Another key differentiator would be the outside processing costs that associate with our improved card fees for
the quarter. So, we did have some very good performance in card noninterest income, as you saw on the
previous slide. But that does come as a processing expense. So, that would be a layer of expense that I would
suspect our peers would not have had.
Beyond that, we did have some built up in our SBA program for PPP loans. It's possible that some of our peers
had an infrastructure already and we're not a real big SBA lender. So there was investment that went into that.
So I would probably point to those three things as key differentiators. But we are seeing the pockets of reduced
expenses and we are managing them very prudently. So, overall, we feel pretty good about the way expenses are
flowing.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. Morning. Back to your PPP comment there, I just want to see if you can give us a little bit more
color around your expectation for how much of the $3.8 billion in PPP production could remain on balance sheet
or conversely, how much of it do you expect to be forgiven? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
It continues to play out in terms of how these are viewed by the Treasury, but we do think that the vast majority
will be forgiven. Right now, our assumption is in the 85% to 90% range but that could have a plus or a minus. We
do think that most of them will be forgiven over the next six months, but we don't see a substantial amount of that
in the third quarter. To the extent it does happen in the third quarter, it will be at the very end of the third quarter,
so I don't see it affecting average balances to a material degree. But that's something that I think we and
everyone else in the Street is keeping a close eye on in terms of just how quickly these are forgiven, and that
should then work through over the next few months.

Okay. That's helpful. And then, separately, I appreciate the color you typically give around the seasonality items
impacting National Dealer and Mortgage. Can you just talk to us, when it comes to the core commercial loan book
outside of those portfolios, what are you seeing in terms of underlying demand? Are you seeing anything at this
point showing signs of improving demand or where do you – where can you give us some color on that? Thanks.

Peter Sefzik A

Yeah. John, I would say in the general books the demand is still pretty muted. There is activity in various markets
in certain industries and we're being selective and smart about the choices that we make. But I can't say that
you've seen a real pickup in demand across really any of the major markets. But I think the company's continued
to be really, really responsible managing their debt, managing liquidity. And so, that would be my answer to that
right now.

Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I'm just hoping you can offer a little bit more color and
thoughts around the dividend. I know you mentioned them in your prep remarks. But I feel like there are just a
bunch of countervailing issues. The return to profitability certainly released some pressure. Capital is back in your
range and then the preferred helps the [indiscernible] (00:32:16), still relatively high payout, though. So, just would
be curious if your – any updated thoughts you have.

Yes. That's it exactly.

Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
You were cutting off over there. First, let me just say that as Jim and Mark and I did as well in my comments, we
are coming at this from a very strong capital position. Preferred issuance helped to strengthen that further on the
Tier 1 side. And always for us from a capital perspective, we sort of pay dividend into two areas. One is how we
support our customers and continue to grow in the organization, and then secondly, how do we provide what we
would consider a healthy and competitive dividend to our shareholders. Obviously, there's a lot of unknowns out
there around the depth and duration of the current economic health crisis. But at the moment we continue to feel
very comfortable both from our capital position and our dividend.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning, everybody. Maybe to follow up on Scott's question. It seems like you guys are in the same
bucket as many regional banks where you may not be forced to cut through your dividend, but just because rates,
you may end up having a very high payout ratio. So as you think about recommending to the board, right, the
dividend where it is right now, how sustainable do you view that over the intermediate term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, Steven. It's Jim. We do very long range forecasting of various sorts, some various scenarios. And we
actually feel pretty good about our PPNR on the foreseeable future. de run out of the range of credit outcomes

and if you layered in just the number of what I'll call normal credit run rates, it appears the dividend is very
sustainable from a payout ratio. And there is some capital left over to grow assets to serve our customers. So I
think the key factor there is how long this credit cycle continues pursuing return to some level of credit normalcy in
the not too distant future which we do expect that to normalize.
And we feel good about the ongoing PPNR and normalized credit costs we are expecting to maintain the dividend
and grow assets to support our customers. So, we feel pretty good about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Jim, you might comment about liquidity of the parent company as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. That's certainly not an issue. We have more than enough liquidity at the parent company, especially with
the preferred issuance we did of $400 million in May. So, we have – we were somewhat of awash in liquidity at
the parent company.
And it really does come down, as you've already pointed out, to the payout ratio. That is the key. We do have
strong capital level staying sin any type of over 100% ratio should that occur again like we had in the first quarter.
But again, the key thing is the ongoing long-term PPNR stream and normalized credit costs. In our modeling, that
is capable of sustaining the dividend.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

portfolios. What I would say is we feel very good about our $1.1 billion in reserve and our 2.15 coverage ratio. The
entire reserve is available for credit losses really in any of our portfolios, and the only one that we have disclosed
obviously is energy. And we feel really get about that plus 10%.

are most concerned about and have been for quite some time. This enter – this industry was under stress prior to
COVID and then, obviously, with the demand shock that took place because of COVID and stay-at-home, that
escalated some of the concerns that we have.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2020
All that being said, we do feel a little bit better about where we are at the end of Q2 than we were at the end of
Q1. Compared to where we were this time last quarter, prices have stabilized, around $40 a barrel and we have a
very heavy oil-weighted business.
The capital markets however are still non-existent and that's what's really leading to our charge-offs. It would be
really difficult and impossible for me to predict exactly what we're going to see in terms of timing of charge-offs,
but just given that elevated level of nonaccrual for this portfolio specifically, we would expect to continue to see
charge-offs in the coming quarters.
This is a portfolio of very large sophisticated borrowers, as Jim mentioned. They have lower leverage than what
we saw in the last downturn, and quite frankly, are operating as appropriately as they could in this really difficult
environment in terms of shutting in wells, controlling CapEx and expenses, and working with us, where there are
any deficiencies in borrowing basis to put repayment plans in place.

Hi. I just wanted to follow-up on Scott and Steve's question on the dividend. So, Jim, looking forward as I look at
consensus estimates, there's definitely plenty of room in terms of dividend coverage for the $0.68 common
dividend. And I'm just wondering the Fed test is backward-looking. And so, if we use dividend coverage according

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2020
to the Fed, according to consensus by the first quarter, you won't be covering your dividend if you look back in
terms of your average net income before preferred because of that loss quarter in the first quarter.
And I guess the question really here is if you haven't gotten any color from your regulators about dividend
coverage for non-DFAST banks, the lookback in terms of dividend coverage in terms of how the Fed calculates it
just doesn't matter to you in terms of how we should think about dividend sustainability as it relates just to
coverage.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
That is correct. We have very strong capital levels. And if you look at the Basel 3 rules it's really not until the bank
dips into the conservation buffer that the [indiscernible] (00:40:45) net income test should really be applicable. So,
it seems to me what the Fed has done with CCAR banks is they've essentially used that buffer above the
conservation buffer and say – and essentially said it doesn't matter. We're going to platform for a net income test
regardless. Now, that's a special CCAR view that regulators have does not apply to us as Curt had mentioned.
And we feel really good about the capital levels, how far above we are of the conservation buffer. We're about 200
bps above it.
So, we just don't have any concerns about dipping into that and we should be good to go just from an overall,
check the box where the key things we're concerned about, payout ratio, parent company cash, capital levels. No
concerns there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. And my second question is, there's been a lot of discussions now among investors in terms of valuing
banks on a normalized returns post-pandemic recession, particularly for stocks that are trading below tangible
book. And as we think about the net interest income run rate post all the PPP noise, post-forgiveness, we're
calculating something like your net interest income would have been $457 million without PPP. And as we think
about the back half of 2021, is that a good jumping off point in terms of how we should think about your core net
interest income power? And what are the puts and takes that would take you above or below that run rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. There are a number of factors that are floating out there that I think it would be beneficial to the run rate. Of
course we're not done with deposit pricing so, there's a little bit to go there and we have managed that pretty
prudently up to this point.
The other big X factor is going to be loan pricing, which obviously makes up the vast majority of our earning
assets. Our loan portfolio rolls over a little more quickly than the typical thing. It's a little bit shorter and we are
seeing expanded pricing in the industry and more [ph] low floors (00:42:47), LIBOR floors are becoming more
predominant. And so, I think that's a big X factor that there is the potential to well exceed the numbers that you're
quoting there for 2021.
But there's just a number of unknowns, the deposit pricing, the loan pricing. I mentioned that we are going to
opportunistically invest some of our excess liquidity in securities, which should give us a small bump. So, there
are some things that we can do to head off this interest rate impact. But it just remains to be seen how much of it
we can offset.

[ph] It all depends (00:43:20) how LIBOR tracks given how it's tracked thus far, if there's some recovery in the

Hi. I just – fair to clarify if you were a CCAR bank you'd probably be forced to cut the dividend but since you're not
a CCAR bank you don't need to, because you have such strong capital ratios that can help you weather the
storm. And maybe that's the benefit of being a smaller, more simple company. Is that correct?

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2020
Well, that's the thousand-dollar question, Mike. It's really hard for us to predict. And as you've pointed out, we are
seeing a rise in several of our markets. Also remember that we have operations in Arizona and Florida as well
and they're seeing a rise there.
The Michigan market did a really good job of addressing the shutdown early on, and it's not seen quite the same
resurgence. But in Texas and California, what I would say is overall is that you're talking about two very strong
economies that came into this situation from a position of strength. California remains the sixth largest economy in
the world, extremely diverse. Texas has had a tremendous inflow of population and net job creation and
strengthened real estate values, etcetera. So, there's a lot of positives that both of those economies bring into this
situation.
If there's a question that you're weathering the storm right now, I think you're located in California so you're
experiencing it firsthand, I do think the governors of both states and local municipalities are doing the right things
and trying to step back and create some social distancing and trying to reinforce some of the guidelines around
mask, etcetera. And so, I think there's some short-term retrenchment that will occur, but we feel good about some
of the longer-term perspective of both of those markets. Again, a lot of that ties to just the overall strength of those
two economies.

we have about 1,400 borrowers that we granted payment deferrals for, a relatively small percentage of the total

book. Probably most importantly, many of those requests came at the very beginning of the pandemic and they
were really insurance policies for our customers. They did not know what to expect going into shelter-in-place.
They also did not know that the PPP program would be launched. So, they asked for them and where they did,
we granted them. 60% of those commercial borrowers resumed paying after about 60 days into the pandemic.
And the majority of these payment deferrals for the commercial book will roll off in July and August.
We do not expect to see any credit losses from these particular actions. And again, I think as Jim mentioned, the
level of requests for a second deferral has been extremely low. The consumer book, again, this is not a big space
for us, but we did have about 600 customers ask for payment deferrals. It's only about $250 million in principal
balances. The vast majority of those will be rolling off between the month of August and October and second
requests there have been modest.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Great. Thank you. And just to follow up, on the securities portfolio, what are the reinvestment rates on those cash
flows at securities? And kind of what are you looking for in terms of the environment to use some of that excess
liquidity and put it into securities?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Obviously, it's a bit of a challenging rate environment. So we're going to consider a mix of securities.
Obviously, we want to keep any excess liquidity tied up in vehicles that are very liquid. So, we would see the
majority of – [ph] with the (00:48:48) treasuries, which are in the 20 to 25 bp range right now, which doesn't sound
like a lot, but it's better than the 10 bps of the Fed, and given it is very likely that we don't really see long-term
rates over the next one to two years taking any kind of significant move. But we'll blend in with that some
mortgage-backed securities, which are also somewhat liquid. And our yielding, as I mentioned in my opening
script, well over 1%. So, we think we can get a weighted average that would be meaningful to helping us just a
little bit in terms of the run rate and utilizing some of this excess liquidity.
And really, if you look at the prepayment rates on both – or the prepayment maturities coming up, both for our
treasury portfolio, we have about $1.5 billion coming up over the next year-and-a-half, two years. And, of course,
MBA prepaids are significant right now for the whole industry, as I mentioned. You can almost view these as just
a pre-investment for maturities coming up in the near-term. So, we feel pretty good and we think it's an elegant
way to just pre-purchase and also get a few extra dollars into the PPNR run rate.

Hey. Good morning. Thanks. I hope you guys are all doing well. Just a quick question, on your CECL

Melinda A. Chausse A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. This is Melinda. I'd like to remind everybody that in Q1 we used the most severe economic scenarios that
we could. In fact, we kept our books open a couple of extra days to make sure. I mean, as you recall, there were
so many things unfolding right at the time we were working on our CECL reserve process.
So, we had very severe unemployment and GDP and oil, oil in particular in the 20s and for an extended period of
time, it would have been at 30%. So, for our current forecast, again, we consider a range of third party generated
forecasts. As Jim mentioned, all of those were recessionary with varying degrees of severity and length. Again,
we took our biggest hit in the first quarter, which is why our reserve build and provision was higher than many of
our peers. For the current forecast period, we have unemployment at 10%, oil at about 30% and stabilizing at
50% by the end of 2022. And peak GDP, which was fourth quarter of 2019 being recaptured by 2021.

Hey. Good morning. I wonder on PPP – and this is as much an industry question as a Comerica question, but I'm
curious for your views. There's one school of thought out there among investors that's definitely strip out PPP net
interest income, underlying trajectory is not great, 2021 has a problem for earnings. But there's another school of
thought that's kind of like, look, these grants, they're kind of grants, they lower the probability of default for a lot of
borrowers, maybe some of the deposits stick around, maybe some new clients were acquired and maybe even
some of these businesses borrow more as they survive and recover. So, for people having that debate around

how should we think about PPP, is it one-time that gets stripped out or is there maybe more ongoing business
benefit than people realize? What are some of the puts and takes you'd speak to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Let me, Brian, make a couple of comment on the front end and then we'll turn to Jim for a little bit more detail
there. First of all, we were honored to participate in the program. And we think it was the right thing for our country
and it was the right thing for so many of our customers, especially the smaller businesses that just really would
not have had an alternative. And our team worked extremely hard to make sure all of our customers were taken
care of and we do believe that there will be some additional stimulus. We don't know what it looks like. It could be
a second round of our PPP. We'll prepare to respond if that's the case. It could be a stimulus check. It could be
something else that may be coming. We are prepared. We are participating in the Main Street Lending program.
We do not expect demand there to be very high, but we will be using that and be accommodative wherever it
makes sense for our customers.
And then, Jim, maybe you want to add on to that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
I was just going to add, and it kind of hearkens back to Erika's question in terms of what could be lost revenue
when PPP goes away. I'd say there's a time and a purpose for any type of lending. And for right now, our
customers want to make sure they can manage the crisis. And that's really the purpose of the PPP loans and, as
Curt said, we're honored to do that for our customers and really for the country as a whole. There will come a time
where those loans are forgiven and our customer is ready to start investing again. And at that point in time, we'll
start hopefully investing in CapEx and borrowing – increasing our working capital levels. So, I think you'll see one
type of lending just transition into another eventually. I don't think it's necessarily [ph] a hole (00:54:19) that's
going to be created.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Foran Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Thank you. And maybe in a similar spirit, it's interesting on your slide on credit, the divergence we're seeing in
criticized assets versus charge-offs and NPLs. And again, this is something not unique to you. A lot of peers are
showing that as well. I mean, you talked to some of the good experience so far in deferrals. You mentioned just
now maybe more government support coming.
Do you think all of this has just delayed the normal relationship between criticized and loss or do you think is
fundamentally altered and lowered it, i.e., the criticized, they're not going to flow through the NPL and charge-offs
in the magnitude they would in a normal recession, or I guess this isn't a normal recession, but given the
economic numbers we're seeing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. This is Melinda. Thanks for the question. I think I'd start off by saying that Comerica's long history of kind of
conservative and disciplined approach to underwriting certainly plays well for us when we do have economic
cycles. We're not the most aggressive in the good times, but we are very, very disciplined. And that gives us
some flexibility to continue to support our customers through these types of situations. Overall, again, ex-charge-
offs or ex-Energy charge-offs were only 4 basis points.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2020
We started into this cycle from a position of strength, as Curt mentioned. I mean, the portfolio was about as good
and clean other than Energy. As we've seen, our borrowers reacted to the pandemic better than I think we all
would have expected. They've demonstrated resiliency. The PPP program was really, really impactful to our
customer base. I don't think we can underestimate that. This $3.8 billion went into – the majority of that went into
our Middle Market and Business Banking portfolios, which is where a lot of our small business customers reside.
And if you look at the percentage of PPP money versus what those customers have in terms of lending
relationships with us, it's a very, very meaningful number. You can almost think of it as quasi equity coming in
once those loans are forgiven. Where we are seeing stress and deterioration we are adjusting our risk ratings
appropriately. Most of the stress that we've seen so far hasn't really been centered in our leverage book,
automotive, and to a lesser degree, that social distancing portfolio.
We're monitoring their performance very closely. We look at liquidity. We have greater visibility into each of these
borrowers and, we would expect any losses that we do experience to be manageable. And, again, we've got $1.1
billion in reserves and a 2.15% coverage ratio to really handle pretty much anything that comes at us.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2020
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
I just wanted to ask, given that the Mortgage Banker and Dealer floor plan are among the most volatile of the loan
lines and given that those two businesses are going through some unique cyclical things, positives and negatives,
can you just kind of walk us through what's happening with each of those businesses and what you're expecting
in terms of normal seasonality and the outlook for each? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Sure. Ken, this is Peter. I'll talk to Mortgage first. What we're seeing there is a bit different I think than
maybe patterns in the past where in the third quarter, we're projecting it to come down a little bit along with the
projections for the industry and refi, particularly maybe up a little bit in purchase. And so, we've seen amazing
activity in that business in the second quarter across the industry, and we're not necessarily thinking that that will
continue in the third quarter where in the past maybe it has. But – so that'll be a little bit of a divergence.
And then on Dealer, you just continue to see less. I mean, if you've been to a car lot lately, there's not a lot of cars
out there. Floor plan continues to be coming down. I do think that there's the possibility of that picking back up as
we start making cars again in Michigan. And so, to the extent that there's more funding for consumers and ability
to buy cars, then you'll start to see turnover [ph] as a loss (00:59:00). But I don't know that that necessarily means
to more increases in floor plan lending in that space either. So, the normal trends are a little bit off maybe from
what we've seen in prior years, probably be next year before we get to kind of a regular seasonal pattern in those
businesses.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got it. And one follow-up on the capital front. As you mentioned, you raised $400 million of preferreds, as did
much of the industry this quarter when spreads tightened. Given that preferreds are still a very small part of ROA
and you've always had CET1 be a major part of your capital stack. Is this the beginning of trying to get that into
better balance over time or was this episodic and kind of a onetime given where market was?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. This is Jim. We're going to leave our options open there. We have no immediate plans to fill in the rest of
the stack, procure one [ph] with preferreds (00:59:47). But it's something I could see, we could see happening
over time. I don't see it in the near-term, but we'll continue to monitor the market and our own RWA growth and
capital levels and make the appropriate assessment in the future.

Ken Usdin Q

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2020
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Terry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Just a question or two on the other social distancing loans. It's a little over $1 billion. Just
looking at the footnotes, it looks like wineries and breweries were removed. I was wondering were there any
changes in the second quarter at all and any portfolios within that other category that experienced an elevated
increase in criticized loans.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
The short answer to that is no. Again, it's a very granular portfolio and the migration really in that whole social
distancing category has been relatively modest.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thank you. Then, just a quick follow-up for Jim. I was wondering if you could quantify the COVID-19 and PPP-
related expenses last quarter. They were called out a couple of times on the call today and in the presentation.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, there are – of course, it gets a little bit squishy in terms of what you include and exclude because there
were expenses realized, some are very obviously, some not. And of course, there are some savings that would
offset that, I heard some of those mentioned earlier.
But broadly speaking, I would characterize it as we had about $10 million of COVID and PPP expenses that were
more extraordinary in the second quarter. We actually see the majority of those continue, but it will come down.
But we will see a little or half of those continue, some of it in the form of contributions which we consider part of
the overall COVID and PPP environment. But it was meaningful in the second quarter and we will see those come
down gradually over time this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
I would like to just add, Jim, that we really work whereas necessary to continue to support our employees through
this crisis. So, you would agree that there are things that we need to do from a benefits perspective to support our
employees, we will do that, and we are very proud of the efforts we're making around giving back to the
community and that's an important – necessary thing right now, especially related to small businesses and some
of the efforts that we've made to help in a number of communities that we serve. Yeah.

Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Brock Vandervliet with UBS.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Brock.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You've got some good disclosure in on Energy. I was just –
wanted to return to that. Just roughly speaking, where would you say your borrower base is really making – able
to cash flow these loans? Is it as low as $40 a barrel? Or is it realistically $45, $50?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
This is Melinda. In general, we have – it's really important to remember that a good portion of our portfolio is very
well-hedged. In fact, we actually saw hedging go up in the second quarter as prices kind of rebounded into that
$40 a barrel. We do have a portion of our portfolio that can cash flow absent any CapEx at $20 oil and $30 oil. But
it's really unique and specific to each company's balance sheet and their hedging strategy. So, I couldn't really
give you an exact percentage on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And as you – you touched on this earlier in the call in terms of the conservatism of your underwriting
historically. As you look at this, at the Energy sector now, does it continue to kind of meet your criteria? Or do you
see the entire sector under real secular pressure that may make this something you want to kind of extract
yourself from over time?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Well, I'll just start by saying that, again, we are committed to the Energy business. And although this has,
obviously, been a challenging time, we've been in this business for decades. We've been through many cycles
and although this one has the added benefit of pandemic, a worldwide pandemic, we feel really good about our
participation in this industry and plan on continuing that. So, no change in strategy. And Peter, is there anything
else you'd add for that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Executive Vice President & Executive Director-Commercial Bank, Comerica, Inc.
I would just iterate that, again, we've been in this business four years. And I think through that, there's probably
three or four cycles that we've been through. So, we're committed to it and intend to stay in the business.
