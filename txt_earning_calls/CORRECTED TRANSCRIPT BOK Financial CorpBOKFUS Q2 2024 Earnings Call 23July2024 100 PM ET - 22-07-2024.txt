President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Thank you, Heather. We are pleased to report earnings in the second quarter of $163.7 million or EPS of $2.54
per diluted share. Adjusting for notable items such as the Visa gain and related charitable contribution, net income
would have been $131.1 million, and EPS would have been $2.02 per share.
Last quarter, I shared an overview of our strategy, which is based on driving long-term shareholder value by
focusing on a well-diversified loan portfolio, including one of the lowest levels of commercial real estate
concentration among peers at 21% of total loans, disciplined credit quality, which has produced attractive net
charge-off versus peers for more than 20 years, industry-leading fee income business mix, top tier risk
management practices with a disciplined focus on capital and liquidity, with a loan-to-deposit ratio below 70%,
and asset liability management practices that have led to well-controlled levels of tangible common equity or TCE,
all of which together allowed us to welcome new business during periods when others were on hold, all paired
with an attractive geographic footprint in dynamic high-growth markets.
These core tenets of our operating philosophy have enabled us to produce attractive returns over time, and given
us a resilience to market stresses that are unmatched. Every time you've seen a stress event in the market, we
outperform. As credit issues surfaced during the great financial crisis, we performed incredibly well compared to
others in our industry being the largest traditional bank not to participate in TARP. Our loan book performance
was also strong when energy prices moved lower in 2014 and 2015, and again during COVID. When interest rate
risk management issues arose in March of last year after an almost 500-basis-point increase in rates in one year,
we were positioned well with one of the higher levels of TCE and more than ample liquidity.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2024
And now again, as the market shows concern over commercial real estate concentration, BOKF has one of the
lowest levels of exposure, with less than 21% total loans, 158% as a percentage of Tier 1 capital and reserves on
a committed basis, and 122% of Tier 1 capital and reserves on an outstanding basis. Importantly, for our
shareholders, we are well-positioned for growth and to produce attractive returns.
As you see on slide 5, we've meaningfully outgrown EPS versus the KRX index over the last 30 years. Over that
time, we've had an 8.6% CAGR versus the index only growing at a median rate of 4.3%. In fact, there were only
three banks that grew EPS at a faster rate than BOKF. This graph illustrates our ability to profitably grow at an
attractive rate, while also having a [indiscernible] (00:04:39) risk management culture that provides stability during
diverse market conditions.
It can be tempting to put banks into one of two groupings, some banks are high growth and higher risk, and others
are lower growth and lower risk. We've proven over a long history that we can be both a strong, stable company,
and produce a higher long-term growth profile. Since I spent some time last quarter talking about our longer-term
strategy, this quarter, I want to highlight opportunities we see in the market, and how we intend to capitalize on
them.
Moving to slide 6, our loan portfolio and credit quality is a good starting point. Looking at the Federal Reserve's
H.8 data, you will see that loans for the broader industry were generally flat during the quarter. However, BOKF
loans increased $381 million or 1.6% linked quarter with growth driven by commercial loans despite payoff activity
in commercial real estate. CRE payoffs, while they made slow loan growth, are nonetheless a part of a healthy
portfolio. All of our payoff activity has been in the normal course of that lending activity. The C&I portfolio grew at
approximately 13% annualized or 9.5% annualized, excluding certain seasonal advances. This didn't happen by
accident. The C&I sales process is a long one, and our process wasn't created this quarter or last, but is rather a
reflection of the fruits of our last few years of concentrated efforts to grow this portfolio.
As you'll see from our credit metrics, we haven't done this at the expense of our disciplined credit underwriting
profile. Net charge-offs are still very low, non-performing loans have again moved lower, and our criticized
classified levels are 11.2% of Tier 1 and reserves, which is among the lowest of the largest banks and well-below
pre-pandemic levels. Marc will elaborate on this, but we believe that strong guarantors and geography play a
critical role in the performance of our CRE portfolio. As part of our underwriting process, we stress each loan at
origination for a rising interest rate environment. We understand the overall credit metrics are below their long-
term sustainable levels, and will revert toward normal as the economic conditions change.
Our fee income businesses remained strong at 40% of total revenue. You cannot find another regional bank that
has the same level of fee income businesses that have been built over many decades, and are all operating at
scale. These businesses produce attractive returns, and offer a diversifying or countercyclical benefit to our net
interest income streams regardless of challenging market conditions. You also saw it monetize 50% of our Visa
stock in their recent exchange program. Many other bank liquidated this asset well before now at deep discount.
However, given our long-term focus, we held onto this investment, and achieved full value for these assets. The
gains generated offset the AFS repositioning losses you saw it take in the first quarter, which produced a $22
million a year benefit to NII with less than two-year payback period.
We remain impressed by the progress we are seeing in San Antonio and Central Texas, which are still operating
ahead of their pro forma projections. We continue to look for opportunities to add talent in all of our markets.

Finally, we repurchased over 400,000 shares this quarter to reflect our long-term confidence in the company, and
to take advantage of attractive repurchase valuations. I'm proud of the quarter that BOKF team has put together,
and appreciate the time to review it with you this afternoon.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Marc.

Thanks, Stacy.
Turning to slide 8, overall loans increased 1.6% linked quarter, with commercial loans up 3.2%, and CRE down by
2.9%. Portfolio yields increased 1 basis point during the quarter. I wanted to spend just a moment expanding on
some of Stacy's opening commentary. C&I loans grew 3.2% over Q1. Even after adjusting for certain seasonal
advances, we still experienced solid C&I loan growth of 2.4% or 9.5% annualized. The sales cycle for C&I is a
long one. For many, there is a greater emphasis on growing C&I than there was a few quarters ago, especially
with the market's concern about the CRE space. This isn't what you're seeing from us. We've been focused for
the last several years on growing the C&I business segment. In our view, this is one of our most profitable
businesses.
When we think about growing C&I, we know that coming with that credit relationship will be deposits and
oftentimes core operational accounts, treasury management revenue and many other opportunities. The results
you see reflect our intentional commitment to this effort. We feel good about our performance today and our ability
to sustain this growth for the remainder of the year. Overall loan growth was muted slightly by CRE payoffs. This
is a good outcome. The normal lifecycle of our CRE portfolio involves the bank providing funding while a project is
under construction, and then a sponsor selling the property once it has been developed. This payoff activity
reflects the health of this book of business, and importantly, all of this payoff activity within the normal course of
business.
Previous payoff levels were somewhat dampened during the rise in the overall rate environment, as well as the
limited activity in the permanent lending space, which is sponsored primarily by agencies, life insurance
companies and the CMBS market. However, recent payoff activity has returned to normal historical level with
elevated activity in the permanent space, and stable valuations within the bulk of CRE asset classes.
Turning to our different loan segments. Loan balances in the energy business increased 0.2% linked quarter. As a
reminder, our energy book is composed of approximately 70% oil weighted borrowers, and 30% natural gas
weighted borrowers. Our energy customers are well-hedged for at least the next year, which means we lowered
our commodity pricing risk on the collateral of these loans. We've continued to grow commitments over the last
several years in this business, but are still seeing customers use lower levels of leverage in this space which has
kept outstandings at current levels. Our combined general business and service loans grew 6.7% linked quarter,
and 4.9% adjusted for seasonal advances. This remains a core focus from a loan growth perspective for us.
Our healthcare business loans decreased 0.4% linked quarter. Credit quality in this portfolio remains strong. As a
reminder, roughly two-thirds of the portfolio is in senior housing combining a diversified mix of skilled nursing
facilities that are Medicare/Medicaid based, stabilized private pay senior living, integrated health systems,
predominantly with investment grade equivalent ratings, and other specialized providers. The healthcare line of
business has a national footprint, but is focused on regional operators with multiple locations, the diversity, and
deep knowledge of their markets. We have a long history of strong underwriting in this space.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2024
Our CRE business decreased 2.9% quarter-over-quarter. We continue to manage to a strict concentration limit,
which is 185% of Tier 1 capital and reserves on a committed basis. We know that ebbs and flows over time, and
this quarter we were down to 158%. You have to look back to the fourth quarter of 2021 [indiscernible] (00:12:24)
with the lower CRE concentration. We do not have the outsized exposure that others do in this space, and while
we have capacity and are not afraid to lend in this space, we are not chasing deals but numbers on the board. We
believe client selection plays a leading role in the performance of this product. Loans are subjected to multiple
stress tests in the underwriting process, including those with stress interest rates and payment shocks.
We also believe a few key factors over and above the standard underwriting play a critical role in the performance
of this product. First is guarantor support. We have meaningful support in over 90% of all CRE loans with
counterparties that we have known for a long time and have demonstrated commitment to supporting their
transaction. Second is geographic location. This portfolio is geographically diverse, but importantly, with most
exposure within the strong economies in our footprint and very little exposure in the areas of the country that
we've seen the largest pullback in prices.
As we discussed last quarter, our credit culture is fundamental to the way that we do business. Our strong
underwriting standards are calibrated to our experience in each of our lines of business. And our process is a
consistent, disciplined approach designed to avoid fluctuating standards based on the economic conditions.
Approximately 81% of our commercial and CRE loan portfolios are floating rate or repriced in the next year. So,
this variable has always been a principal factor for us.
On slide 10, you will notice credit quality remains exceptional across the loan portfolio, and well-below historical
norms. Non-performing assets, excluding those guaranteed by US government agencies, decreased $27 million
this quarter, an exceptional outcome. The resulting non-performing assets, the period-end loans, and
repossessed assets decreased 12 basis points to 0.35%, and non-accruing loans decreased $29 million linked
quarter. Committed criticized assets remained well-below pre-pandemic levels as a percentage of capital. Net
charge-offs were $6.9 million or 11 basis points annualized for the second quarter, and have averaged 9 basis
points over the last 12 months, extending the trend of performance far below our historic loss range of 30 to 40
basis points. Looking forward, we expect net charge-offs to remain below historical norms.
We remain well-reserved with combined allowance for credit losses of $330 million or 1.34% of outstanding loans
at quarter-end with the $8 million provision reflecting a stable operating environment and loan growth
expectations. We believe the combined reserve is the most appropriate metric to consider if you want a holistic
view of comparative credit reserve levels. We expect to maintain an appropriate reserves for a loan growth and
reflective of economic conditions. We've traditionally outperformed during challenging credit cycles, and are well-
positioned should an economic slowdown materialize.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Scott.

Now, turning to slide 12. I'm proud of both the results we posted this quarter and the strategic initiatives our
excellent team has accomplished. After years of planning and organizational readiness, we successfully launched
a modernized wealth management platform on July 1. Initial results have been very encouraging, and the client
experience with the transition has been positive. This was a complicated project that required much planning and

thought. We didn't rush to find a solution, but patiently orchestrated a positive outcome for the company, our
employees, and most importantly, our customers. And I'd like to thank everyone who was involved.
Now, turning to our operating results for the quarter. Total fee income contributed $200 million of revenue this
quarter that represents 40% of total revenue, which is a peer-leading contribution from these businesses, and
reflects the strength of our franchise in the space. I'll begin by covering our markets and securities businesses
again on slide 12. Our trading fees decreased 26.1% to $27.7 million during the quarter, consistent with broader
industry trends for this activity, driven by slightly lower trading spreads versus the prior quarter. This business is
primarily composed of our fixed income trading business and mortgage-backed securities, and to a lesser extent,
municipal bond trading. We found a unique franchise in this business as we facilitate the hedging and production
of mortgages for more than 500 mortgage originators.
This line item will be most influenced by changes in mortgage origination volume. When volume is higher, both
our trading spreads and volume will increase. Importantly, we're at a very low levels of origination volume, and
we're still seeing attractive results in this business. While this may be volatile, it's often countercyclical with our net
interest income businesses, and produces good diversification of our existing revenue streams.
Mortgage banking revenue remained relatively consistent this quarter at $18.6 million, reflecting continued
improvement in the mortgage origination market and increased volumes from 2023. Customer hedging has
remained steady at $6.8 million this quarter. This revenue stream is associated with the hedging activity we
facilitate on behalf of customers. We offer our customers the ability to hedge commodities, interest rates and
foreign exchange. The largest component of this revenue is driven by our energy customers, hedging their oil and
natural gas production. In many cases, energy customers are required to hedge as part of their loan agreement.
When markets become more volatile, income tends to increase.
To give a few examples, when oil prices increased in the first half of 2022, we saw energy customers take
advantage of those higher prices, and lock in protection on more of their production by putting on hedges with us.
As a result, our income in this segment increased at that time. Another example is when rates decreased
substantially during COVID in 2020. Our customers perceived that it was an attractive time to participate in
interest rate hedging, and engaged with our desk to use interest rate swaps to convert floating rate loans to fixed.
The brokerage fee line item previously included insurance business that we sold fourth quarter of last year, which
explains most of the year-over-year decrease in this line item. However, in looking specifically at brokerage
excluding insurance, we've experienced solid growth in this segment.
Turning to slide 13 to cover our asset management and transactions businesses. Asset management revenue
increased 4% to $57.6 million. This was primarily driven by seasonal tax preparation fee income. AUMA
increased by $1.9 billion as valuations increased. There were a couple of primary factors that drive results in this
business. The first is the amount of assets under management and administration. This can change as the
valuations of our client's bond and equity portfolios increase or decrease in value as a result of our sales team
growing new accounts. Second is the spread we earn on assets under management. This quarter, we earned 21
basis points on total AUMA. For managed funds, we've earned 49 basis points, and for funds under
administration, we earned 10 basis points. Within each of these segments, the type of customer will also influence
the amount of fees earned. Our revenue will change as you see migration within our business mix.
Transaction card revenue increased by 6.9% to $27.2 million, driven by an increase in volume of transactions
processed during the quarter. This business is a top 10 electronic funds transfer business, which provides debit
and credit issuing processing or EFT solutions for almost 500 financial institutions, and merchant processing

solutions for over 4,000 businesses throughout the United States and Virgin Islands. Again, I'm proud of the
results for this quarter.
And now, I'll hand the call over to Marty to cover the financials.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Thank you, Scott.
Let me start by commenting on the Visa exchange program we covered in our last earnings call. This program
allowed us to monetize 50% of our Visa B shares in the second quarter, and recognize a $54 million pre-tax gain.
This gain offset the $45 million securities loss we took in the first quarter, and enabled us to donate $10 million
worth of those converted shares to the BOKF Foundation to further invest in the communities we serve.
Turning to slide 15, capital and liquidity continue to be very strong. CET1 is 12.1%, and TCE is 8.38%. TCE,
adjusted for all securities portfolio losses, is 8.06%. The capital strength we have displayed over the years and in
the most recent year in particular is the result of capital planning and stress testing processes that include TCE as
well as the regulatory ratios, and serves us well in all economic environments. Our current loan-to-deposit ratio
stands at 58%, and our coverage of uninsured and non-collateralized deposits increased to 188% with this
quarter's deposit growth of $858 million. Our strong capital position enabled our opportunistic approach to share
buyback. During the second quarter, we repurchased just over 400,000 shares at an average price of $90.38 per
share.
Turning to slide 16, you will see that net interest income grew $2.4 million versus the prior quarter, demonstrating
that the trough in this line item is behind us. Strong loan growth and asset pricing continued to support NII growth,
and deposit headwinds continue to abate. The interest-bearing deposit cost increase of 7 basis points for this
quarter was less than a third of what it was in the prior quarter. The DDA average balance decline was also less
than a third of what it was in the prior quarter.
Net interest margin was sequentially lower by 5 basis points, but 4 basis points of the 5 basis points were driven
by the denominator effect of higher average balances for the trading portfolio and the AFS securities portfolio.
That securities-related growth was largely neutral to net interest income. We remain confident that net interest
income will continue to grow sequentially, driven by loan growth and the repricing of the fixed rate portion of our
balance with a stable or modestly increasing net interest margin.
Turning to slide 17, linked-quarter total expenses decreased $3.7 million or 1.1%. Personnel expense fell $11.6
million, driven by a number of factors, some of which were more timing related, such as the incentive
compensation items and some are not, such as the payroll taxes and the benefits expense. In addition to the $10
million Visa share donation mentioned earlier on the call, we also made a $3.6 million contribution to the BOKF
Foundation this quarter. We recognized $1.2 million of expense related to the FDIC special assessment estimate
in Q2, compared to $6.5 million in Q1. All remaining expenses were consistent with the prior-quarter activity.
Turning to slide 18, this provides our outlook for 2024. Our net interest income guidance of $1.2 billion presumes
one rate cut for 2024 in November. We expect fees and commissions to be in the neighborhood of $825 million.
We're assuming recent securities trading revenue trend to persist into Q3, and MBS trading is the primary driver
of potential variability in that element of guidance. We expect the efficiency ratio for the full year to be near 64%.
We anticipate 2024 provision expense to be similar to or somewhat lower than 2023 levels given our very low
level of non-performing assets and our stable economic outlook.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION

question comes from the line of Michael Rose with Raymond James. Please go ahead.

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions.
Scott, maybe for you we can start off. Appreciate all the color on the fee businesses. It looks like maybe the
takedown in the guidance really just relates the second quarter results in brokerage and trading line item. Can you
just talk, as we hopefully get a few rate cuts here or at least if we bake in the forward curve and then what's into
next year, how you would expect that business really to perform? And it seems to me just based on some of your
explanations around some of the fee businesses, especially that and mortgage that we're probably at or near a
low point, and those businesses look like they have some tailwind as we move into next year if we do get some
cuts. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Bradley Grauer A
Executive Vice President-Wealth Management & Chief Executive Officer-BOK Financial Securities, Inc., BOK Financial Corp.
You bet. And so, in essence, you answered your question exactly how I would. As I mentioned, I agree with you. I
think that we have settled into the current rate environment and the current mortgage production levels. So, what
we're seeing there, we think, is it has, in essence, bottomed. What will stimulate further activity in the MBS piece
specifically, which is the biggest variable there that Marty mentioned, is whether or not we get a Fed rate cut,
which will stimulate greater mortgage production, which picks up the TBA piece, the mortgage originator hedging
activity for us, that increased volume will help us there.
Additionally, our downstream activity to our financial intermediaries that we actively serve with MBS product on
managing their portfolios will move out the curve once we get some clarity out of the Fed move. So, we do think
that as we move into an environment where Fed cuts, we'll see a pick-up in activity, and the net mortgage
production will increase the volume and the flows.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Appreciate it. And then, maybe just as a follow-up for Marc, it sounds like loan pipelines are pretty good at this
point. I would expect some of those CRE paydowns to slow as we move into the back half of the year. But we are
seeing C&I companies generally de-lever a little bit, particularly in the clients that you would serve. And just given
this quarter's strong growth, how do you kind of reconcile the two just based on what we're seeing at some other
banks, and would just love some color there? Thanks.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2024
Well, I think the main thing here we've been doing on the C&I side is we have been actively doing this for quite
some time. C&I loans take a while to obtain because it's more of a relationship-oriented business, and not driven
by transactions around capital and asset acquisition. And so, it's not been a matter of lower usage by our existing
customer, but we've been able to obtain new customers. And so, we've actually had a broader growth pattern
than we've had for quite some time. So, we think we can continue to sustain that, maybe not at the level we saw
in the second quarter, but excluding the seasonal advances, we expect to see something similar to that for the
rest of the year.
And on CRE, you're right, we do expect payoffs to slow, but we have the opportunity to look for the right kind of
deals, to add new deals, and it will mostly be in the construction phase. So, it'll take some time for those to fund
up, but we expect to see that over the next 12 months.

Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Michael, this is Stacy. I mean, I think our geographic footprint here is awfully helpful. But to go back to the original
thesis here, we've been focused on this, but at the same time, we were really gearing up. Our sales effort here is
when a year ago last spring was when the markets felt disruption. And so, others who may not be seeing that,
there are those who are ostensibly pulling back to manage their liquidity and capital in a different way. And so,
part of the growth that we're seeing is adding talent, adding market share and being in really great markets to
grow from. And so, it's kind of the confluence of all those that are creating the outsized growth for us this quarter.

wanted just, if you take a look at the NII guide for the full year, it basically implies that the margin is up about 10
basis points for the back half of 2024. I just wanted to see if I'm thinking about that right and if there was anything
that might change that outlook and maybe the variables that are going into that thesis that you guys were focused

and the variability. I think that's a good question. So, we just made two small changes to our outlook, and neither
one was very large. We took out the Q3 rate cut and reflected the CRE payoffs that we saw in Q2. And yes, we
do view that the margin was really pretty stable this quarter, because the decline was really only driven by a
denominator effect of the AFS portfolio and the trading account. So, underlying that really the pretty good stability
there. And we do expect that as the both DDA and the deposit rate trends continue to just slow down
incrementally even from what we saw in Q2 that that ends up giving us a tailwind on net interest margin
percentage, plus or minus the usual quarter-to-quarter noise that you just naturally get. But the underlying trend,
we do see that as up.
And then, on your question of, kind of what are the pluses and minuses around how we think about that trajectory,
it would be certainly positive relative to how we're thinking about the NII outlook, could be positive if we could get
the Q3 rate cut, could be positive if we have better loan growth than we've got incorporated in our thinking about
that guidance. And then, on the negative side of CRE payoffs end up being higher or the DDA or the interest-
bearing trends don't pan out quite as we expect, and those could be really pluses or minuses.

Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then sticking on guidance, I was a little surprised that you didn't tweak down the
expense growth for the full year, just kind of given the second quarter, and just wanted to go back to that line and
just see what – I know there's obviously probably some inflation on salary in the back half of the year from merit
raises, but wanted to see if there was anything else in particular that was keeping that mid-single-digit number
unchanged from the prior guidance.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, Brett, keep in mind, we did bring down the efficiency ratio guide from – last quarter it was 65%, and this
quarter 64%. So, I'd focus on that as you think through the guide. I mean, we did have a good quarter. I would just
note that some of the incentive comp declined quarter-over-quarter that's not really run rate, we should probably
had a little bit of that back. But we do feel good about being able to have good expense control through the rest of
the year. Now, we've got some IT projects that are going to bring the data processing line up just a bit.

Hey, Jon.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
I just want to make sure I understand your loan growth guide back on Michael's question, but I think what you're
saying is, when I look at the guidance, it suggests a pretty consistent pace of net growth from here to get to the
middle of the guidance range. Is that a fair way to look at it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Bradley Grauer A
Executive Vice President-Wealth Management & Chief Executive Officer-BOK Financial Securities, Inc., BOK Financial Corp.
Yes. I think that's the right way to look at it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Jon, and if you go back to January, I mean, we're really outperforming our loan growth expectations from a C&I
perspective. And we said back in January that the real question for us was commercial real estate paydowns. We
didn't know exactly what was going to happen there, and I would still say that's still the case. I think we're getting
closer to the trough there, but we don't know if that's second quarter or third quarter in terms of net paydowns
there.
But on the C&I side, we're very optimistic. We feel very good about the pipelines there. And if it was just C&I-only
guidance that we provided, we'd probably guide it up a little bit. But it's the CRE uncertainty that really is the
headwind in the near term, although that will create a tailwind for 2025 and 2026 as we begin to rebuild that
portfolio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, you can sure see that on slide 8.
I guess another question would be on the other side on deposits. Can you talk a little bit more about the drivers of
deposit growth this quarter? And Stacy, earlier in your comments, you talked about your low loan-to-deposit ratio.
So, I'm just curious philosophically how you look at that. Do you continue to grow deposits faster than loans or do
you somehow try to bring that ratio back up over time?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
I answered a couple of ways, Jon. I think, one is we typically think about deposits funding the loan book, and the
securities portfolio is largely self-funded through wholesale fundings, and that's the way we've run the bank for

most of my career here. However, we will look for opportunities where we can incrementally fund the securities
book cheaper than we can from a wholesale perspective with deposits. And so, we're seeing incremental
opportunities to grow the deposits that are incrementally better than wholesale funding. And so, we'll continue to
do that where it makes sense.
But I think as you see us, where we think we're positioned from a growth perspective, we want to maintain ample
liquidity. We're comfortable letting that loan-to-deposit ratio slide up. But in the context of other incremental
deposit funding opportunities to displace wholesale, we've allowed those to continue to happen and to grow, and
feel good about that. We're well-positioned in the marketplace. People see us as strong and capable, and so
that's created opportunities for us. And so, we're continuing to take advantage of that where those opportunities
exist for us.

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Good afternoon. I'm just wondering, on the deposit beta, it's been at the upper-end of peers with the increase in
rates. But what's the outlook for the down-rate beta, because it does look like we're finally going to get some rate
cuts?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, Peter, and you're right. Our deposit beta just simply reflects the fact that we've got a more commercial and
wealth mix in our deposit base. And so, you saw the effect when rates went up. You're going to see the same
effect when rates come down. We're going to be able to have a deposit beta that's easily in the mid-50s in down-
rate scenarios. We're very confident and know exactly how that'll play out. So, that'll be helpful for us once we
start to see rate cuts coming through.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
So, would it be in the high-60s, you think a down-rate beta?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
We've all learned those aren't necessarily just linear from the get-go and they stay flat. So, I think that using
something that's in the mid-50s to start with and as rate increases continue, that might migrate up. It's definitely
possible. I mean, higher beta, so as rates decline, that beta can increase just as we saw on the [indiscernible]

Got it. And then, just on deposits, right, so period-end deposits, they were up 9% year-over-year in the second
quarter, certainly a lot stronger than I would have thought. But you maintained that deposit outlook for modest
growth. And just how you're you thinking about deposit growth then in the back half of the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Hey, Peter, one thing that you should pay attention to the DDA, the ending balance of DDA was high, just
customer activity right at the end of the quarter drove that up. Pay attention to the average balance in DDA as
you're thinking about looking forward, I think that'll help clear up your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. That's the right answer, Peter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
You want to focus on averages on the deposit side, there's a lot of volatility that happens in any one period. So,
averages are a better way to look at deposits from our perspective.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. And just you gave period-end as your guidance, but I hear you. And then, if I could just get one more
follow-up question, just the outlook on expenses, mid-single-digit growth, do you exclude the FDIC assessment
and charitable contributions? I'm just wondering what's the base you're using for 2023?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, especially when we think about the efficiency ratio, we're leaving all that in just as it was. And I think
that the same is true on the growth rate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
So, the growth rate for expenses is really on a reported basis?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
That's correct. We're not normalizing for the special assessment or for the charitable contributions for the whole
year efficiency ratio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Woody Lay with KBW. Please go ahead.

Wood Lay Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. How's it going?

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Hey.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Wood Lay Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
A quick question on deposits. Just looking at the deposits broken out by market, it looks like you saw really strong
growth in your Texas markets but on the demand side and interest-bearing side, and maybe there's some
volatility with that between average and period-end. But can you just give some color on what you're seeing in the
Texas markets, specifically on deposits?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
If you think of it, this is Stacy, I mean, one of our key growth objectives for our company for the last several years
has been to grow Texas. And so, you saw us with the expansion in San Antonio, and on the wealth side, we're in
Austin. So, really the focus on Central Texas, but we've added talent in Dallas and Fort Worth and Houston. We
are very focused on that market, and part of how we're growing is through deposit acquisition. And so, you're
seeing kind of the fruits of that labor there. And clearly, from our perspective, it's something that we expect.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Wood Lay Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. And then maybe lastly, just shifting over to capital, capital remains really strong. The buybacks were good
to see, but obviously, we've seen the stock price move up from here. Just further appetite for buybacks with the
current stock price.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. I'd just note that as you well know, we're price sensitive in how we think about share buyback. Our goal is
to add shareholder value through that activity, and the share buyback that we've done over the past year has
been very accretive to shareholder value. We're very happy about that. But with incrementally higher prices, you
should expect to see us incrementally scale back and have a cooling effect from higher prices.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Wood Lay Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. Thanks for taking my questions.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks for taking the question. Most of mine have been addressed. I'll just ask about M&A. We've seen a handful
of transactions kind of in or around the footprint. Would just love somewhat better thoughts around the bank's
appetite for M&A and the opportunities you see in and around your footprint.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, Matt. We've talked before, I mean, M&A is something that we would be interested in, but we're going to
spend our capital that's going to be for the right opportunity. And it's really hard to find a type of franchise that
would be a good fit with us both culturally, which is significantly important, but even levels of concentrations in real
estate, strength in core deposits and things like that. You start to run the filter, we want to expand outside our
footprint, we want those strong characteristics of the bank that we've acquired so that we don't have to diminish
the value by running loans off that don't fit our profile. So, the practical answer is they're just not a lot that really
fits the filters that we would look for there. And so, it's unlikely that you would see us do something like that in the
near term. We do have an appetite, but it's got to fit our profile for what fits for us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Makes sense. Sounds consistent with kind of the past. And I guess just lastly on capital, if the buyback is
potentially less attractive, these current valuations, it sounds like you'd be okay with allowing capital levels to build
in the near term or are there other uses of capital we should think about?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. We've got a history of being patient and making sure that we're thoughtful about when and where we
deploy capital. So, yeah, to continue to recognize that we're happy to be patient and watch for the right
opportunities.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good afternoon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Hi, Timur.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Maybe circling back to the line of questioning around deposits, maybe if you can quantify just the late quarter
inflow into DDA and whether the average kind of down 3% is the right way to be thinking about it, and maybe just
when you see some of those DDA pressures starting to abate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. Timur, I think an easy way to think about that is the Q2 average for DDA was $8.387 billion. The June
average was almost exactly the same number. So, we've really seen a nice leveling off of activity there. And while
we may not be exactly at the bottom, we're feeling pretty good about just the trajectory we've seen really since
February.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Great. And then, just looking at bond, cash flows and reinvestments, kind of with all the work being done on
the bond book, can you give us a sense of where those yields ended the quarter, kind of what's the bond yield
looking like in 3Q given both the reinvestment opportunities and some of the restructuring activities?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think if you look at the average yield for the bond portfolio in Q3, I mean, that's fairly representative,
because the restructuring activity, that was all right at the end of Q1, so Q2 was fairly clean. And so, probably the
important thing to think about is we're still getting like $500 million average a quarter, this quarter was $600
million, but kind of durably $500 million a quarter of cash flows that get reinvested each quarter. And this quarter,
we were able to gain 165, 170 basis points between what the cash flows came off at and what we were able to
reinvest in. And so, that trend will just keep continuing, and that's going to be an important driver of margin
expansion over the coming multiple quarters.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great. And then, just last for me, your comments around uncertainty just with CRE paydowns, I guess that
messaging has been a little bit mixed throughout the industry, but I'm just wondering what's driving the elevated
paydowns in your book? Is your maybe CRE exposure a little bit insulated from what we're seeing in other
geographies and other asset classes? Or I guess, what are the categories that are driving the payoff activity? And
I'm wondering if there's anything lumpier in the back-end of the year that might be driving...

...it's really just a function of we have a portfolio that largely starts with construction, and once there is a level of
occupancy that it can be refinanced in the permanent non-course market it is, and that's what's happening. So
Marc, in his prepared comments talked about it's going to lifecos, it's going to CMBS, it's going to agency,
permanent non-recourse financing, and that's the way that portfolios work. It's just slower to rebuild behind it is
some of those borrowers that we have are slower to start the new project are being a little bit more cautious, and
so the rebuild behind that. But the portfolio paydowns is really very healthy and very typical of our portfolio. You
just don't have the advances that are kind of offsetting that today that I think you'll see in future periods as more
confidence around this sector begins to emerge.
