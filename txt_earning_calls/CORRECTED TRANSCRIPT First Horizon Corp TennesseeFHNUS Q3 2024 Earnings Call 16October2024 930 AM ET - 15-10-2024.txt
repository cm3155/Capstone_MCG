D. Bryan Jordan
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Thank you, Natalie. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Before we get into the details of the
quarter, I want to express our concern and support for those who were impacted by Hurricanes Helene and
Milton. I'm incredibly proud of our team – how our team prepared for and responded to the needs of our
associates, clients, and communities. We were on the ground immediately providing food, water, fuel, and other
essential supplies.
In North Carolina and Tennessee, all but one of our banking centers are back open with mobile banking units on
site there to provide continuous banking services to our clients. Florida is in the early stages of recovery, but our
banking centers fared well and all are open at this time. We've also announced financial commitments to the
restoration of these communities and will remain heavily engaged in the rebuilding process.
On slide 5, we've shared some of the financial highlights for the quarter. First Horizon delivered another strong
quarter for our shareholders as we grew revenue, maintained expense discipline, improved credit coverage, and
continued to generate capital. Our results this quarter reflect the strength of our diversified business model and
our continued focus on growing and deepening client relationships.
We achieved an adjusted EPS of $0.42 per share, which was a $0.06 increase from the prior quarter. Pre-
provision net revenue increased $11 million, improving our adjusted return on tangible common equity to 13.2%.
We continue to deploy capital through share repurchases, buying back 75 million of stock in the third quarter and
over $440 million year-to-date. We ended the quarter with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.2%. Our results
continue to demonstrate the benefit of our disciplined credit culture as we sold just $24 million or 15 basis points
of net charge-offs this quarter.
I'm proud of the dedication of our bankers – that our bankers display in serving our clients and communities
throughout the Southeast. I believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on our attractive footprint and
opportunities to grow along with these markets. As we head into next year, I remain incredibly optimistic that our
franchise is fully equipped to navigate any economic environment we encounter while continuing to enhance
shareholder value.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Hope to run through our financial results in more detail. Hope?

Thank you, Bryan. Good morning, everyone. On slide 6, you will find our adjusted financials and key performance
metrics for the quarter. We generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.42, a $0.06 increase from prior quarter.
Pre-provision net revenue improved by $11 million from last quarter, largely due to strong performance from our
fixed income business, while our net interest income and adjusted expenses remained essentially flat.
We continue to see solid credit performance from our portfolio with net charge-offs of 15 basis points and $35
million of provision expense. ACL coverage increased modestly to 1.44%, including $8 million of qualitative
reserves for potential losses related to Hurricane Helene. The improved revenue and lower reserve build drove an

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2024
increase in our adjusted return on tangible common equity to 13.2%. Our CET1 ratio increased to 11.2%,
modestly above our 11% near-term target, driven by lower than expected risk-weighted assets due to a late in the
quarter portfolio sale.
On slide 7, we outline a couple of notable items in the quarter, which reduced results by $0.02 per share. Third
quarter pre-tax notable items include a $2 million credit to expenses that was trued up to the FDIC special
assessment accrual; a $15 million of Visa derivative valuation expenses related to the escrow funding that
occurred in September; and lastly, $2 million of restructuring expenses associated with the operational
efficiencies we have continued to identify. All of this totals an $11 million reduction to net income.
On slide 8, you will see that NII of $631 million was relatively stable to the prior quarter, benefiting slightly from a
higher day count. The net interest margin compressed 7 basis points from last quarter to 3.31% with better asset
yields partially offsetting higher deposit costs. The increase in average deposit costs was driven by higher use of
brokered deposits, as well as acquisition costs on the $1 billion of new client growth.
Loan yields expanded 3 basis points from second quarter, benefiting from new and renewing floating rate spreads
and repricing of fixed rate cash flows. As we move into the fourth quarter, we expect modest margin contraction
due to lag between the loan and deposit repricing.
On slide 9, we take a closer look at our strong deposit growth. Period end balances increased 3% with client
acquisition driving almost $1 billion of growth. We are also pleased to see that non-interest-bearing balances have
continued to remain relatively stable over the last few quarters. The average rate paid on interest-bearing
deposits increased to 3.44% from the 3.35% spot rate we saw at the end of June. This was driven in part by the
higher use of brokered deposits, as seasonality in loans to mortgage companies drove a higher need for funding.
Deposit costs are already beginning to improve with the interest-bearing spot rate declining to approximately
3.33% by the end of September, partially due to the $9 billion of deposits, which are market indexed. Deposit
rates have declined another 5 basis points in October, with a spot rate today of 3.28%.
We will continue to make progress on repricing the deposit portfolio as we have approximately $18 billion of
promotional deposits that are set to reprice over the remainding (sic) [remainder] of the year, in addition to the $1
billion of brokered CDs that are maturing.
On slide 10, we have an overview of loans. Average loans were up 1% from the prior quarter, driven by
seasonality in loans to mortgage companies. Period end loans declined 1% or $335 million from last quarter. This
included an opportunistic sale of approximately $340 million as we exited the sponsored health care lending
vertical. The portfolio consisted of approximately 20 relationships of higher leverage, low-pass graded health care
loans. We do not have the intent to sell any other loan portfolios in the foreseeable future.
After a period of fund-ups in our commercial real estate portfolio, the balances in this portfolio have stabilized. As
previously mentioned, loan yields were up 3 basis points from second quarter due to wider spreads and fixed
cash flow repricing. As we move into the fourth quarter, loan yields are likely to decline, as 56% of our loan
portfolio is indexed to short-term rates.
On slide 11, we highlight the increase in fee revenue we saw in the quarter. Fee income, excluding deferred
compensation, increased $11 million from the prior quarter. Average daily revenue in our fixed income business
improved 22% to $593,000, driving a $7 million increase in fee income. July was a relatively muted month.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2024
However, as the market confidence and rate cuts increased, we saw increasing momentum in the business in
both August and September.
Lastly, other non-interest income increased $5 million due to some non-recurring items, including securities and
other gains, higher Federal Home Loan Bank dividends, and BOLI benefits.
On slide 12, we show that excluding deferred compensation, adjusted expenses decreased by $1 million.
Personnel, excluding deferred comp, was down $1 million from prior quarter, as a reduction in incentives and
commissions offset the impact of a higher day count on salary expense and elevated medical expense. The $2
million reduction to incentives included the continued step-down in retention awards that took place at the end of
the second quarter and outweighed the incremental incentives associated with the higher fixed income
production.
We are constantly evaluating options to improve operational efficiency. This quarter, we implemented two items
that impacted head count. First, we optimized the retail staffing model across our footprint to more efficiently
serve our clients. We also recently outsourced our property management functions, which lowered head count
and salary expense, but will be offset by some incremental occupancy cost. We expect this to make our building
support more efficient, while providing a better experience for our clients and associates.
Moving down to occupancy and equipment. There was a $2 million increase driven by our new property
management engagement, as well as incremental software maintenance and depreciation from our strategic
initiatives. Offsetting the increase is a $2 million reduction to outside services driven by lower advisory services,
as certain strategic initiatives enter the production phase.
I'll cover credit on slide 13, which continues to perform very well. Net charge-offs decreased by $10 million to $24
million or 15 basis points of average loans. Loan loss provision was $35 million this quarter, increasing ACL
coverage to 1.44%. The $11 million of reserve build included $8 million of qualitative reserves related to Hurricane
Helene, as well as the impact of continued grade migration, which was partially offset by improved economic
scenarios.
Non-performing loans increased $4 million, with an increase in C&I, slightly exceeding declines in consumer and
commercial real estate. We remain optimistic that our clients can navigate to a soft landing, as 63% of commercial
NPLs are still current on their payments. Overall, we are very pleased with the continued strength of our portfolio
through a high rate environment and expect to see continual improvement if rates do continue to decline.
On slide 15, we'll talk through our outlook for the remainder of the year. What we have laid out here is consistent
with the guidance we gave last quarter, though we are now focusing more on total revenue versus the individual
components. We believe total revenue will be flat to up 2% year-over-year with the composition driven by what
the Fed chooses to do over the next couple of months. Our countercyclical businesses are a natural hedge
against our asset sensitivity. If we see incremental declines in interest rates, those businesses revenues will offset
that incremental NII pressure.
Turning to expenses. Our guidance remains unchanged as we remain committed to continuing to identify
efficiencies to help offset our investments. For net charge-offs, you can see that we are trending favorably to our
guidance, but we have left the range unchanged until we have more information on the potential for losses that
could arise from the recent weather events in our footprint. Lastly, we continue to target an 11% CET1 ratio near
term.

I'll wrap up as we turn to slide 16. I am proud of all the progress we have made as a company so far this year. We
are focused on improving profitability, while making the strategic enhancements needed to set us up for success
as we continue to grow the franchise. As a leadership team, we remain extremely optimistic about the future of
First Horizon and are excited to continue delivering value to our shareholders and a premier banking experience
for our clients.
Now I'll give it back to Bryan.

D. Bryan Jordan
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Thank you, Hope. Many of you have heard me say that our goal is to stack one good quarter on top of the next.
This quarter added momentum to that track record and puts us one step closer to achieving our longer term return
goals.
As an organization, we are intently focused on execution. We aim to improve revenue through client growth and
retention while maintaining expense discipline through operational excellence. We will continue to align capital
and resources with the greatest business opportunities, while enhancing our technology capabilities to deliver
exceptional client experience.
I remain confident that our diversified business model, including our well-established countercyclical businesses,
will allow us to continue to deliver strong shareholder value over the remainder of 2024 and into next year. Our
associates' dedication, combined with our attractive footprint and extraordinary client base, positions us to build
an unparalleled banking franchise in the Southeast.
Thank you to our associates for all that you do for our clients, communities, and for each other.
Carly, we can now open it up for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, Bryan. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala, Bank of
America. Ebrahim, your line is now open.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
...maybe Bryan, Hope [indiscernible] (16:46) it makes sense in terms of talking about total revenue versus NII fees
given the countercyclicality of your businesses. But just talk to us – I guess the question there, in case in the very
near term, NII, I think, Hope, you mentioned a margin compression over the next quarter or two will impact NII.
When we look at the fixed income business, the $47 million in fees this quarter, is it as good as it gets in terms of
the upper bound on this? Or what's – like, we've seen a fair amount of bond book restructuring in their banks,
rates – rate got cut – rates got cut. Or is there another leg higher to go on additional rate outlooks certainty?
Would love for you to address that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Good morning, Ebrahim. This is Hope. Happy to answer that question. I mentioned in my comments that we saw
a very muted July. So, we absolutely think we see some upside if we continue to see rates decline as September
and August were much stronger than July. And we've seen strong momentum ending the quarter.
The one thing you mentioned was, were people still buying? We had a conversation with our business the other
day. If rates go down another 75 basis points this year, they've already talked to some clients that locked things
that earlier this year that – late last year that are thinking about restructuring again. And so I do think there'll be
continued momentum in a decreasing rate environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Understood. And just the other question was around the loan-to-deposit ratio. I think you called out the decline
from 97% to 94%, partly driven by the – some of the actions you took during the quarter. I know we talked about
this in the past. Just remind us, when you look at the 94% loan-to-deposit ratio, is there a certain level to which
you're managing to? And as a result, is that kind of making you a little bit more cautious in terms of how quickly
you flex deposit pricing lower?

Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
We continue to monitor our loan-to-deposit ratio, but we also monitor there are our loans plus securities-to-deposit
ratio. We run a much smaller securities portfolio than most of our peers. And our belief is that as much as we can
use deposits to help our clients, that's where we want to put it first.
As we move forward, we continue to see loan-to-deposit ratio does tend to change as we have to fund up
mortgage warehouse. And you'll see, we did put additional brokered on.
We're comfortable generally with where it's at in the near term, but, of course, we want to continue to work it down
over time. I would say, it's not the biggest piece of our competitive pricing. What we're trying to do is defend our
home front. We want to make sure that clients that are with us are staying with us.
And so I would say, the new-to-bank absolutely comes in at a higher rate, but it's, really, the back book and the
current clients that are being made offers by other banks that are out there looking for the same deposit growth
that we're looking for. And to retain them in order to continue to have deposit growth quarter-over-quarter does
come in a little bit higher of a premium.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Ebrahim, I'll add, we look at our deposit activity and deposit pricing largely through the customer acquisition lens.
Now, we don't think about it in a significant way around loan-to-deposit ratio. So ,while that is important over time,
we look at growing customer relationships. And you'll note that we grew customer deposits about 3% during the
course of this quarter, about $1 billion or so on the customer side.
And we want to continue to grow in what are very attractive footprints with high-quality customer relationships.
We're pricing attractively versus wholesale funds, and we're pricing attractively to gain market share. So, while the
two are somewhat related, we spent more time focusing on how we grow our customer relationships, particularly,
and our retail, private client, high net worth businesses.

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Hope, I just wanted to dig into your comments on
the margin a little bit. Certainly understand a little bit more pressure in the fourth quarter, just given the mismatch
of timing that you referenced.

But as we think about the margin into next year with some of the tailwinds, as you mentioned on the deposit side,
some additional repricing opportunities – I think the slide deck mentioned a chunk of deposits that was eligible for
repricing $18 billion of promotional client deposits that are eligible for repricing in the fourth quarter.
Are we at a point where the fourth quarter, do you think, is the inflection point for the NIM, and we can move
higher despite your rate sensitivity? Or is the expectation that it's going to be a push and pull each quarter and we
shouldn't expect the margin to really move, at least over the next couple quarters? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Michael, thank you for the question. I would say it's probably going to be more of a push and pull quarter-to-
quarter. It really depends on how quickly we do the rate cuts. We see back-to-back rate cuts in November,
December, and then we see some stabilization. Our margin can stabilize, but we continue to see month after
month or quarter after quarter repricing down.
As I mentioned in my comments, our loans are going to – 59% of our loans are going to reprice down our
deposits. We're going to have to work through that as they come off promotions and new-to-bank. So, I don't think
it will necessarily be a steady trajectory one way or the other, based on the current forward curve in 2025. But we
are doing everything we can to put things in place to make sure that we can take somewhat asset sensitivity off of
the table as we see a very uncertain rate cut environment.
For example, we just shortened our new-to-bank furloughs, that you see a 90-day guarantee to 45 days
guarantee, and that allows us a little bit more flexibility quicker. And we are less asset-sensitive currently because
of that deposit repricing. It's just maybe the lag quarter-to-quarter, especially depending on how late in a quarter
we get the loan repricing [ph] for at (00:23:21) the deposit side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
One of the key variables, Michael, is, as Hope said, the pacing of rate cuts. And as she properly noted, the more
significant rate cuts are, the more impact you will see on net interest income, but the more offset you'll see in our
fixed income business, et cetera. And that's why we focused on the total revenue where we think we're
significantly more balanced and less sensitive to interest rate cycles than it might appear if you focus on one line
item or the other.
But we do believe that we've got the balance sheet positioned in such a way that we can manage through interest
rate volatility. And we will adapt to whatever pace the FOMC sets for moving rates in the rest of this year and into
2025.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Certainly understand that. Maybe just as a follow-up, and I know that rate backdrop is difficult to project, and I
know it's early for next year. But is the plan or the expectation that you can grow kind of adjusted PPNR year-
over-year? And are you planning at this point for positive operating leverage?
And I asked that because I certainly understand you pulled some levers on the cost savings front, but we're
hearing more and more banks looking to hire bankers. I assume that would be some of your expectation to drive

some balance sheet growth. But just wondering, just initially, if you had any comments on how we should kind of
think about that. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. We'll provide a little more guidance in the remainder of this quarter or outlook for next year. But I sit here
today, I expect that we will drive positive PPNR next year. And we're still working through the various line items,
but I do think you will see us growing our PPNR in 2025.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Bryan, one for you. Give us your thoughts on loan growth expectations. Looks like you guys referenced some
CRE stability, but C&I was a bit weaker. But talk about what you're seeing, how much of this is self-imposed, and
what kind of an outlook you have for growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. I would say, very little of what we're seeing is self-imposed. We're not limiting the size of the balance sheet.
There's one caveat to that that I will come back to in a second. The loan growth in the marketplace is somewhat
muted at this point. It has not picked up.
I couldn't tell you, well, how to weight the parts, but I suspect some part of it is what happens in the elections that
are coming up in the next month. It's partly weighted on what the Fed is going to do with interest rates and, in
particular, when deals start to look better financially. And then, just overall, are we going to have a soft landing or
something else?

And I'm somewhat optimistic that we get through the next 90 days. We'll have greater clarity maybe on all three of
those. And if we do, I think there's some pent-up loan demand. At least, we hear that in our customer
conversations. The marketplace is still somewhat muted, and it's still very, very competitive at this point.
I mentioned the one exception. There are a few places where we have taken some participations, where we had
been in participations for a period of time. We had not broadened or deepened the relationship as we thought we
might, and we've used the opportunity to exit out of some of that. But other than that, we're looking to grow with
our client base. We're looking to grow and lean in when customers are ready to make investments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Fair enough on that. So, maybe a little more optimism potentially. I know that's a lot of hedging there, but it
feels like you're still somewhat optimistic on growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
I didn't mean the hedge as much as I meant to convey uncertainty about what's going to happen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Hope, a follow-up on fixed income. Are you willing to share what the ADRs look like in August and
September? How big of a step-up that was? I think that would help us with maybe your run rate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Jon, I actually don't have that in front of me. August and September were generally pretty equal, as I recall. But
the end of September following the rate cuts was a significant uptick. And right before the rate [indiscernible]
(00:28:44) I would say that months were not materially different, but the weeks told a much different story.
Nobody really wanted to buy anything right before the rate cut and after the rate cut. We finished the quarter really
strong. And I think we'll see that same type of momentum as there's uncertainty about rate cuts in the coming few
months.

Jon, the 10-year, the rate curve has moved around a good bit as people's expectations for the economy have
changed. I gave you the last two weeks. If you look at the first week of October, we were a little over $1.1 million.
Last week, we were a little over $500,000. So, two weeks does not make a trend, and it moves around based on
what interest rates and sentiment in the market are doing.
On the whole, we were a little over – I think we're at $563,000 for this quarter and – just passed. And our outlook
is to be slightly better for that than the remainder of the year. And you have to keep in mind, as you well know,
that at some point the markets tend to shut down as you get into the back part of the year. So, we're optimistic on
activity for the remainder of this year.

And maybe just going back on the deposit side, the $18 billion that you referenced, that's coming due in fourth
quarter. Could you give us an update on the pricing of those deposits now and where you expect to see that move
into? And also, is there a term change in that promotion?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Jared, yeah, starting at the end of your question, we have changed the term as recently as last week as we
continue to look at how to bring down rates. It is really a sensitivity analysis of how sensitive our clients to how
quickly the rates are falling. And so we did just roll out the of last week new rates that, as I mentioned earlier, only
guaranteed for 45 days versus our prior 90. Our money market is currently at 4.25%. That compares to 5.05% last
quarter when you asked me on the earnings call. Our retention offer is now 3.5%.
And so we've been walking it back ahead of the rate cut and after, and we have quite a few scenarios for how that
might walk back depending on the rate cuts we see in Q4. December rate cut is really hard for us to make much
headway with deposits, and so the November rate cut will have the most meaningful impact on how much we can
walk it back.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. Okay. Thanks. And then as we look at the deposit composition, what's the appetite for additional brokered
from here? I heard your commentary that you built that up in anticipation of the mortgage business. Should we
expect to see brokered be a bigger part of the overall deposit mix? Or are we near the top?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Jared, our goal is always use client money first and brokered second, but let's start with that being our goal. The
more we can bring and retain client money, the less brokered we need. Brokered for us is always kind of a match

funding for mortgage warehouse. We saw mortgage warehouse on average of about $400 million last quarter,
which I'll note is against past years, typically Q3 comes down, and we actually saw it come up with some of the
rate cuts. And we saw our refi activity actually increased 5% quarter-over-quarter.
So, as we think about that, it's really going to be more about mortgage warehouse and how much we continue to
have balances there in the short run. But, yes, our goal is always try to get out of it quarter-over-quarter when we
can, whether we see decreasing mortgage warehouse balances or increasing client money. But I am comfortable
where it's at. We're well below our peer group the last couple quarters when I compared our growth rate versus
theirs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. Thanks. And then just finally for me, I know you're guiding us more towards total revenue versus NII versus
fees, but with the expectation. How should we think about the dynamic between continued margin pressure, but
potentially some balance sheet growth? Are we at a trough for NII here or trying to gauge? Or what the – our
ending the year, what the exit of NII is for 2024?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Jared, for 2024, I don't see much of a change from our prior guidance. When you look at the new revenue
guidance we gave, it is in line of both revenue and NII, [ph] just so we come in the (00:33:36) low end of one, the
high end on the other.
For us, not just for Q4 going into next year, as we think about NII, the big unknown for us is how much mortgage
are we going to see? It's our highest yielding asset, and so we did see a large refi boom when it moved from a
22% to historical 30% or 40% or 50%. We've been seeing that would help NII significantly. So, as we talk about
countercyclical, FHN Financial is in the fee income line, but the majority of mortgage warehouse and mortgage is
in the NII line.
So that also is, as we talk about embedded hedges, that we do have an embedded hedge with hopefully loan
growth going into 2025 of both of those businesses.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2024
Yeah. This is Bryan. We're looking to really grow across the entire deposit base. We have had very – been very
active in growing our non-interest-bearing deposits. They've been stable, which sort of follows along with what we
articulated earlier in the year, which is you get to a core level as a percentage, it drops a little bit, but that's
because we grew non-interest-bearing.
But we're looking to grow customer relationships, and growing core checking account, non-interest-bearing, low-
cost deposits is an important part of that. So, we have had a number of efforts across our entire franchise to grow
those deposits, and we will continue to lean in and look to grow client customer relationships on the commercial
and the consumer side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Understood. And then, Hope, the 12% of loans that are ARMs, can you give us a sense for what sort of weighted
average yield that part of the book currently has? And I understand that over the next year, there's not much of a
reset on any of those. But I guess as we think about late 2025 and 2026, are there sort of bigger chunks that we
should be aware of as we model NII?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
I don't have the weighted average of where they're at currently from the rate, but we don't have a large wall of
them at any time in the next three years. They've kind of been steadily added to our balance sheet over the last 2,
2.5 years. What I'll say, though, is we expect a lot of them to get prepaid. They're being fixed for, five, six, seven
years, whatever they have left at a 6%, 7%, if we really see rates get cut 100% to 200%. That is one of the items
that I think will – that I mentioned earlier that we could see a large amount of refi in the ARM space for what we
have on our balance sheet today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
If I remember correctly, and I look to Natalie because she remember these numbers better than I do, but you can
use as a proxy, I think our consumer loan portfolio yielded in the 5.8% or so range, maybe a little higher in the
third quarter, and that's largely driven by ARM. So, that's a proxy for that number.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Agreed.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2024
Good morning. Hope, maybe a question, or Bryan, on the PPNR, 2025 being above 2024. Just, I guess, a couple
questions, maybe a comment between, is that more of a revenue comment or an expense control, given your
steps? And secondarily, does that currently factor in the forward curve right now? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yes. So, if I break that yes down, we can prognosticate about rates that it's probably most efficient to always use
a forward curve. So that's sort of our point of reference. And it's been in flux. And we're always focused on
growing revenue. We're always focused on controlling expenses.
I think we have a number of catalysts that we're working to leverage that are really, really important in terms of our
ability, not only of driving PPNR in 2025, but creating long-term shareholder value, essentially taking our return to
a little over 13% on tangible common equity back north of 15-plus percent. And those initiatives that we're focused
on are really the logical follow on of the work associated with the merger of equals that didn't get done during the
integration period.
So, we see a number of opportunities once we get the systems investments made at a very tactical level to grow
revenue, to deepen relationships, to drive additional loan growth, and to control our cost, centralizing – further
centralizing processes, things of that nature.
So, I'll circle back around to, yes, we think it's going to be across all of the levers that you mentioned.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks, Bryan. And then maybe on regulation, your target of 11% on CET1. You're
slightly above it. I would expect – you're saying, you're going to continue with the buyback. But just any changes
over the medium term that you might be contemplating now that Basel has been a little bit watered down? And
also maybe a comment, Bryan, about where you are on the investment for $100 billion. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Yeah. We look at capital, and literally our board is involved in any discussions about buyback and
authorization. We feel like we have sufficient authorization to get us through the fourth quarter. We will talk to the
board in the early part of 2025 about further authorization. We don't see any short-term catalysts to bring the
CET1 ratio below 11%. What we've said is, we're looking at the economy and how things play out.
And I would – or get circle back in some ways to what I said earlier, that customers have uncertainty about soft
landing and interest rates and the election process. That clarity they get will also be clarifying to us. And the more
certain we get about continued strength and improvement in credit performance and things like that, the more
comfortable we get as we approach a soft landing to bring that ratio down. We do think that the CET1 ratio is
above where we need it through the cycle. So, we will look at that. Probably it'll be sometime in the early part of
2025 before we really start to reassess it in a meaningful way.
The second part of that is regulatory hurdles, particularly around becoming an LFI on $100 billion. We are doing a
fair amount of work and then making investments in the near term to prepare for crossing that threshold. As we
look at it, we think we've got a number of years to do that work. And we will further those costs in over time and
build those capabilities, that infrastructure.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2024
But given the markets that we're in, given the strong client relationships that we have, we do believe that leaning
forward and growing the balance sheet is an important part of it. And it's not a matter of if we hit the $100 billion
threshold, it's really a matter of when. And that we are going to build the preparatory infrastructure to get it in
place so that it won't be an obstacle to our ability to continue to grow on the other side of that.
I also think that in the event that you have a more difficult landing, building that infrastructure gives us the
opportunity to be opportunistic. If there are strong deposit base, that we have the opportunity to pick up in a more
difficult financial set of circumstance today, you have more trouble in institutions.

is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. Maybe one for Hope, just following up on some of your comments relating to mortgage outlook
for next year. I guess, what's the rate environment need to look like for mortgage to get back to some of the type
of performance that maybe you were implying on the upside?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Our overall belief is that we have to be at a sub-6% mortgage rate. How that will play out is a little bit uncertain.
This last 50 basis point cut barely touched mortgage rates as the forward – as the curve became less inverted
and actually had a steepened curve for a little while there.
What I think it will be the telling thing and the thing that we continue to see is, new home purchases. They're not
refi, the first-time home purchases. Second homes has been historically low for the last two years. So, a lot of the
data we're seeing in the mortgage industry says we have the highest supply we've seen [indiscernible] (00:44:32),
buyers will start getting back in. So I think it's going to be a combination of new purchases when we get under a
6%, as well as a refi, where people are in their fixed rate part of their ARM.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then maybe just on the revenue guide, it implies a pretty wide range of outcomes in the fourth quarter.
I'm just wondering where the greater variability is. Is it on the NII side? Is it on the fee side? And then, maybe
more specifically, on fees you called out some of the other fees this quarter as being onetime in nature. Can you
maybe give us a starting run rate for 4Q kind of ex some of those onetime fees?

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2024
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Sure. What I would say is, start with, we did not intend to change our range. It really comes down to rounding is,
we would have had to say like, instead of flat, it would have been 0.33. The intent is not at all to change our
revenue range for Q4 or for the year.
There's probably more upside on fee income and more downside on NII, if the forward curve plays out. We really
see 75 basis points of cuts in two successive months. NII will be on the lower side and fee income will pick up. If
we don't see any cuts, NII is going to come in better. I think fee income would look similar to this quarter. It's really
hard to handicap whether – when the current forward curve is 75 basis points, but most of the market doesn't
believe we'll get more than 25 basis points.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then just the one-timers this quarter for fees, was that the full increase in the other line?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
I'll say the other items, it always bounces around. BOLI is something that – it just comes when it comes, and you
don't know. So, we often have to comment on BOLI since we do run a portfolio of that moving quarter-to-quarter. I
can't really predict what's going to happen next quarter. Obviously, you can figure out as well that those dividends
pay in a quarter arrears. And the more that we're borrowing, the more we get those dividends. I don't expect it to
be materially up or down, if I'm honest. It tends to go about in a $5 million range quarter-to-quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great. And if I can sneak one more question in, so the comment on commercial real estate that the funding
schedule has kind of stabilized out, I'm just wondering, as we do get rate cuts, as pay-downs start to accelerate, is
there any way you can quantify maybe what historical pay-downs have looked like, what they have looked like
more recently, and what type of headwind that might be to broader loan growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)

Thomas Hung A
Chief Credit Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. I think – this is Thomas Hung here. I think that's going to be a little hard to predict right now because, for
us, a lot of our commercial real estate is – went heavier on the construction side and probably a lot of our peers.
And so in terms of pay-downs, it'll really come down to the other term financing market, how much appetite there
is for that term take-out financing. That's what will really drive the level of pay-down that we see.

Christopher Marinac Q

Thanks. Good morning. I have a follow-up credit question as it relates to the Shared National Credit exam this
year. Is there anything that could fall out on that in terms of either inflows of NPAs or, more importantly, charge-
offs as we move into Q4 and Q1?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Hung A
Chief Credit Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Hi. This is Thomas Hung again. I don't expect so. Overall, Shared National Credit, it's run a little under $8
billion for us overall. And if you look at kind of the relative performance of our SNC book to our C&I book, the
metrics are all generally about the same, in line. There's not really a material difference in terms of our classified
assets, NPLs, or year-to-date net charge-offs.
And so my expectation is that SNC should continue to perform about the same as the overall book. We haven't
really seen a variance.

that.
