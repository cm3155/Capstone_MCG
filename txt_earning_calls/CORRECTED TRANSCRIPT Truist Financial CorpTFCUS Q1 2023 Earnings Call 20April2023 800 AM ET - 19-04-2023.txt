William Henry Rogers Jr.
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thanks, Ankur, and good morning everybody and thank you for joining our call. I know you have a busy day
ahead of you. The first quarter of 2023 was certainly an unusual and maybe impossibly and a historic one for our
banking industry. I am really extremely proud of our more than 50,000 teammates who leaned into our purpose
and continued to care for our clients and stakeholders, reassuring them of Truist's position of strength and
commitment to serve them.
Throughout the quarter, we continued to experience the benefits of our shift from integrating to operating, as
evidenced by improved organic production and increasing client satisfaction scores which in our branches
ascended to new highs from the weeks after March 9. Based on the volatile and uncertain environment, we
successfully demonstrated the strength and resiliency of Truist's diverse business mix, scale and market share,
granular and relationship-oriented deposit base and strong capital and liquidity. But as we'll also discuss, some of
that positive momentum was offset by some higher funding costs and somewhat elevated expenses.
Strategically, we continue to take actions to optimize our franchise and focus our resources on areas where we
have an advantage in the marketplace and at the same time, simplify, consolidate or exit certain activities to
improve profitable growth. Mike will share some of those details later in the call. We'll provide more details on the
quarter's results and other topical items throughout the presentation. But first, let's begin with our purpose on
slides 4 and 5.
In uncertain times, it could be easy to focus on the short term at the expense of the long term which is why it's
important that we always lead with purpose at Truist. These slides are a powerful reminder that the most effective
way to grow over the long term is to deliver on our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities. But
today, my comments will be on this topic a little briefer to gauge investor interest and other topics.
Our purpose statement intentionally begins with the words inspire, and that's exactly what I witnessed while
working closely with our teammates in March. As I mentioned, I was inspired by how our teammates leaned into
purpose and care as they held numerous discussions with clients and stakeholders to answer their questions
about the banking system, to emphasize Truist's financial position and strength, and help them move forward with
their financial needs.
In addition to client care we provided last month, there were many other ways we actualized our purpose
throughout the quarter, which we highlight on slide 5. You can read more about these items and many of our
other efforts to build better lives and communities in our 2022 Corporate Responsibility Report, which we
published last week.
Now, I'll walk through our first quarter performance highlights on slide 7. Quarter performance slide focus mostly
on GAAP or unadjusted results given that MOE-related [ph] event exceeded (00:04:36) our run rate last year.
Going forward, we intend to focus primarily on GAAP results with exceptions of adjusted tangible efficiency and
adjusted PPNR, since intangible amortization expense remained significant due to the scale of the MOE and has
no impact on capital generation.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Truist reported first quarter net income of $1.4 billion or $1.05 a share, up 6% like quarter due to strong growth in
adjusted PPNR, lower merger cost, partially offset by a more normal provision level compared to a year ago.
Relative to the fourth quarter of 2022, EPS decreased 13%, primarily due to lower net interest income and
seasonality. Adjusted PPNR decreased 7% sequentially, consistent with our prior guidance, as better-than-
expected fee income due to higher capital markets activity was more than offset by lower net interest income and
somewhat higher-than-expected expenses.
Relative to the first quarter of 2022, adjusted PPNR grew 19% and we delivered 310 basis points of positive
adjusted operating leverage, reflecting a good start to the year. Asset quality remained strong and net charge-offs
continued to normalize consistent with our expectations. We prudently built our ALLL ratio 3 basis points to reflect
the more uncertain economic environment. Balance sheet trends, despite all the noise in mid-March, were fairly
expected and more business as usual, and we'll cover more about loans, deposits, capital and liquidity later in the
presentation.
To move into our digital and technology update on slide 8, continued investments and progress in digital will be
even more critical due to the close relationship between digital engagement, primacy of relationships, and
deposits. The good news is, Truist prioritized digital early in the merger, building the Truist digital experience
organically and in the cloud which allows us to fully own the digital experience for our clients end-to-end.
Our first quarter results reflect our continued investments, agility and momentum. In the first quarter, we opened
146,000 deposit accounts digitally, exceeding our internal expectations. We saw strong growth in digital
transactions and Zelle in particular, underscoring the importance of payments and money movement capabilities
to our clients.
More broadly, we had an incredibly productive technology quarter, as we advanced our strategy to reimagine our
capability set. In the deposit space, we launched a new data-driven deposit pricing engine which provides
personalized relationship-based rates for clients during account opening and will allow us to be even more
targeted with respect to rate paid.
We also enhanced our digital lending capabilities with the launch of our commercial loan dashboard, an industry-
leading solution that allows wholesale lending clients to track the status of their loans, upload documents and,
eventually, electronically sign documents. Our goal is to eventually incorporate this dashboard into One View, our
desired end-state integrated digital experience across payments, lending and capital markets, creating a
seamless experience for our commercial and corporate clients' entire relationship with Truist.
Turning to loans and leases on slide 9, loan growth was solid in portfolios targeted for growth and lower in
portfolios where we've intentionally pulled back. Average loan balances grew 1.7% sequentially, while end-of-
period balances increased a more modest 50 basis points. The slower growth on an end-of-period basis was
intentional and expected, and reflects our strategic decision in the second half of last year to reduce production in
certain lower-return portfolios, including indirect auto and correspondent mortgage, while also increasing rates
and spreads from ongoing production.
C&I balances increased 3.6% on an average basis and 1.8% on an end-of-period basis due to continued growth
across CIB and CCB, reflecting the benefits of our capabilities and our markets. Consumer loan balances
decreased 60 basis points on average and were down 1% from December 31, reflecting ongoing runoff in student
and partnership lending, as well as lower indirect auto production.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Strategically, we're focusing our balance sheet on Truist clients who have broader relationships while limiting our
balance sheet usage with more single product and indirect clients. We're also evaluating ways to increase the
velocity of our balance sheet, increasing greater utilization of loan sales on securitization. This allow us to be
more impactful and increase returns in businesses such as Service Finance.
Next, I'll provide some perspective on overall deposit trends starting on slide 10. Despite the unique events of
mid-March, average deposit trends during the first quarter were generally consistent with our expectations.
Average deposit balance decreased 1.2%, driven by quantitative tightening, inflation and movements to higher
rate alternatives. Within the month of March, more deposit flows were concentrated in the period from March 11 to
March 18 and have largely been business as usual since including through yesterday.
Deposit outflows during mid-March were primarily related to CIG and CCB clients who chose to diversify into
money market mutual funds and in some cases, across multiple banks. These outflows tended to be of higher
cost non-operational deposits. And we also experienced deposit inflows, as we're both attracting new clients and
expanding our relationships with existing clients. Retail production continues to improve due to our shift from
integrating to operating and leading with the value proposition of Truist One.
In the first quarter, Truist saw record new deposit production, including 18% year-over-year uplift in branch
account openings, with improved client retention driving strong net new account performance. Commercial
Community Banking had record new account growth in March, and we've seen good momentum in the first couple
of weeks of April, as clients are beginning to move money to fund those accounts. More noteworthy than overall
deposit flows was the pace of the mix shift from DDA, as non-interest-bearing deposits decreased to 32% of
deposits from 34% previously. This happened a little sooner than we'd previously anticipated.
Interest-bearing deposit costs increased 64 basis points sequentially, contributing to our cumulative interest-
bearing deposit beta of 36% so far in the cycle. Deposit betas accelerated relative to the fourth quarter due to the
presence of higher rate alternatives and the previously mentioned shift from non-interest-bearing DDA into
interest-bearing products. We'll continue to be attentive to client needs and relationships while maximizing the
value outside of rate paid.
Given higher investor interest and additional deposit details, we've provided a closer look at our deposit base on
slide 11. Truist has one of the most robust deposit franchises in the banking industry, thanks to three key factors.
First, Truist has strong market shares in many of the fastest growing markets in the US. Truist currently ranks
first, second or third in deposit share in 17 of the top 20 markets. Those include cities like Atlanta, Charlotte, DC,
Miami, Tampa, Raleigh, Durham, among others, making us the dominant player in the Southeast and Mid-
Atlantic.
Second, Truist has a granular retail leading deposit base that is 63% insured and/or collateralized, which is the
second highest in our peer group and an important source of stability. In addition, our commercial deposits are
diversified across 21 industry groups with no one sector representing more than 10% of corporate and
commercial banking deposits. Third, we're highly relationship-oriented, as you can see from the table at the
bottom of the slide. The average deposit account at Truist has been open for 17 years, during which time these
relationships have broadened to include multiple products and services.
In Retail & Small Business Banking, we have over 12 million deposit accounts, with an average account balance
of $17,000. RSBB deposits are highly granular and 86% of balances are insured. In addition, Truist is the primary
bank for the preponderance of those clients. In our wealth business, 90% of the depositors have investments with
Truist Wealth, in our Commercial Community Bank, 81% depositors have a payments, lending or advisory

relationship with Truist, with the majority of that related to operating and treasury management products.
Together, these factors are a source of strength for Truist and for our clients.
So, now, let me turn it over to Mike to discuss our financial results in more detail.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone, I'll begin with net interest income on slide 12. For the quarter,
taxable equivalent net interest income decreased 2.8% sequentially, as higher funding costs and two fewer days
in the quarter more than offset the effects of solid loan growth. Reported net interest margin decreased 8 basis
points, while core net interest margin decreased 7 basis points.
When you break down the decrease in the core net interest margin, approximately 5 basis points was driven by a
shift in the funding mix from DDA and other low-cost deposit products into interest-bearing deposits, and about 2
basis points was due to our decision to conservatively carry more liquidity during the last few weeks of March.
Moving to fee income on slide 13, fee income was relatively stable compared to the fourth quarter and modestly
exceeded our expectations in light of typical seasonal headwinds. Insurance income increased $47 million, largely
due to seasonality. Year-over-year, organic revenue growth was 4.7%.
Mortgage banking income rose $25 million, primarily due to a gain on sale of the servicing portfolio which was
partially offset by MSR valuation adjustments. Income from core mortgage activity was relatively stable compared
to the prior quarter.
Wealth management income improved $15 million, benefiting from the increase in brokerage commissions, asset
flows and higher fees due to rising asset prices during the quarter. Wealth continues to build momentum, as net
organic asset flows, which exclude the impact of market value changes, were approximately $1 billion for the
quarter and have been positive for seven of the last eight quarters.
In addition, we were pleased by the modest increase in investment banking and trading income, led by strength in
investment grade and high-yield bond originations, fixed income derivatives and loan syndications.
CIB's performance continues to be aided by two idiosyncratic factors: strategic hiring over the past two years, as
well as increased Integrated Relationship Management activity. With respect to IRM, capital markets fees from
non-CIB clients increased 12% sequentially and were 20% up from first quarter 2022.
Other income decreased $56 million, primarily due to lower income from our nonqualified plan. While fee income
remains below its potential, our investments in key areas such as insurance, investment banking and wealth, will
continue to be a source of momentum as markets normalize and as our IRM execution continues to mature.
Turning now to slide 14, reported non-interest expense declined $31 million, driven by a $107 million reduction in
merger costs due to the completion of integration activities and a $27 million decrease in amortization expense.
The expense reductions I just described were largely offset by a $103 million or a 3% increase in adjusted non-
interest expense. Expense drivers included a $39 million increase in pension expense and a $23 million increase
in regulatory charges due to higher FDIC premiums.
We also experienced a $33 million increase in operating losses, which are reflected in other expense, due to
industry check fraud issues and an operating loss within Truist Insurance recognized prior to completing our

transaction with Stone Point. As a company, we're committed to generating expense reductions and have
undertaken a number of actions that help bend the expense arc at Truist.
Last week, we announced a strategic realignment within our fixed income sales and trading business, in which we
discontinued certain market-making activities and services provided by our middle markets fixed income platform.
This platform was largely focused on MBS-related sales and trading for depositories and had produced an
unattractive ROE. This realignment will result in an approximate $50 million run rate expense save with little
PPNR impact and enable us to focus more on our core strategy of being a fulsome and premier investment bank
for corporates, sponsors and municipal issuers.
We're also in the process of realigning our LightStream platforms with our broader consumer business, with the
goal of bringing the innovation, digital capabilities, efficiencies and cloud-based infrastructure of LightStream to
Truist's broader client base. This will reduce the cost of supporting a separate brand and strategy and enhance
the experience and primacy with our existing and prospective clients.
In addition, we continue to adjust our capacity and focus in mortgage, to reflect current challenging market
conditions and our own strategic focus on client primacy. These actions, among others, are what drove the $63
million of restructuring charges during the quarter. Furthermore, we've also aligned executive compensation to
Truist to shareholder expectations, which I shared with many of you about a month ago. Taken together, we
believe these, as well as other actions we're taking, will increase our focus, bend our expense curve and improve
returns for Truist.
Moving to slide 15, asset quality remained strong in the first quarter, reflecting our prudent risk culture and diverse
loan portfolio. Leading indicators remained favorable. Loans 30 to 89-days past due decreased 15 basis points
sequentially and were down 17 basis points versus the first quarter of 2022. Our NPL ratio was steady at a
relatively benign 36 basis points. Net charge-offs increased 3 basis points to 37 basis points, primarily due to C&I
and continued normalization in consumer, and are consistent with pre-pandemic levels.
We became even more cautious in our outlook regarding CRE fundamentals, and in light of increased economic
uncertainty, we prudently increased our allowance by $102 million and increased our ALLL ratio by 3 basis points
to 1.37%. In anticipation of an increasing risk environment, we're also tightening credit and reducing our risk
appetite in selected areas, while maintaining our through-the-cycle approach for high-quality long-term clients.
Next, given high investor interest, I will dive deeper into CRE on slide 16. As we began the integration process to
become Truist, we were very intentional about retaining the diversification benefits of the merger. To achieve this
outcome, we carefully evaluated our various portfolios, including CRE, to ensure we fully understood their
combined risk profile and to establish how we would manage them going forward. While we did not wholly pause
CRE production during this process, we did deemphasize it until we aligned on a single go-to-market strategy.
As a result of this decision, Truist's CRE portfolio actually decreased by 2.2% from the end of 2019 to the end of
2022, whereas our median peer grew CRE 21%. Our disciplined focus on diversification has also resulted in less
CRE concentration and risk relative to our peer group. At year-end, CRE represented 11% of our loan mix
compared to 12% at our median peer, and the office segment comprised 1.6% of our loan book versus 1.9% at
our median peer.
We maintain a high quality CRE portfolio through disciplined risk management and prudent client selection. We
typically work with developers and sponsors we know well and have observed their performance through the
cycle. Our exposure tends to be large CRE with strong institutional sponsorship and we have reduced our

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
exposure to smaller CRE. The quality of our CRE portfolio is also reflected in the Federal Reserve's annual stress
test results.
Our disciplined approach to CRE is reflected in our asset quality metrics which remains solid. In the lower right,
you can see a snapshot of our office portfolio which had approximately $5 billion in outstanding balances as of
March 31 and another area where Truist has been risk-averse and highly selective over the past two years. Our
office portfolio tends to be weighted towards Class A properties within our footprint, which we believe will perform
better than large urban markets. We have a great CRE team that is very proactive in working with clients to get
ahead of any problems. Criticized trends have increased over the past few months, but we believe overall
problems will be manageable given our conservative LTVs, our reserves and the laddered maturity profile of the
portfolio.
Turning to capital and liquidity on slide 17, our CET1 ratio increased from 9% to 9.1%, as approximately 20 basis
points of organic capital generation was partially offset by 12 basis points of CECL phase-in. While not included in
our CET1 ratio, AOCI improved by $1 billion from December 31 to March 31. Of our $12.6 billion of after-tax OCI
as of March 31, $8.5 billion is related to our AFS portfolio, $2.5 billion is related to the frozen portion of the HTM
portfolio, and $1.5 billion is related to our pension plan. We would expect the securities portfolio-related OCI to
decrease by $2 billion to $2.5 billion by the end of 2024 or by approximately 20%, and that's in a static rate
environment. In addition, this accretion will be a powerful driver of higher tangible book value per share over time,
the small glimpse of which we saw this past quarter with tangible book value increasing 8%.
On April 3, we also closed on the sale of a 20% minority stake in Truist Insurance Holdings, which added
approximately 30 basis points to our capital ratios and provides flexibility in the future. Additionally, we declared a
strong common dividend of $0.52 per share, which was paid on March 1.
Finally, Truist continues to have significant access to liquidity and a very robust liquidity manage process that
includes internal and external stress testing, as well as real-time monitoring of our liquidity position. Our average
consolidated LCR improved 113% during the first quarter and remains well above the regulatory minimum of
100%. We have access to approximately $166 billion of liquidity, including cash, FHLB borrowing capacity,
unpledged securities and discount window capacity. As a reminder, government and agency obligations represent
97% of our securities portfolio, which produces about $2.5 billion to $3 billion of cash flow per quarter.
During the quarter, we conservatively increased our cash position from $16 billion as of December 31 to $33
billion at the end of March, funded largely by callable FHLB advances and would expect that to somewhat
normalize going forward given that activity has stabilized. More broadly, we do expect regulatory requirements
around capital and liquidity to heighten, but believe we're in a strong position to respond given the already high
expectations for an institution of our size, the strategic and financial flexibility we have as a company, and the
orderly phase-in period that would likely accompany potential changes.
And now, I will review our updated guidance on slide 18. Looking into the second quarter of 2023, we expect
revenues to be relatively stable compared to the first quarter, as a modest decline in NII is offset by seasonally
stronger insurance revenue. Adjusted expenses are anticipated to increase 1% to 2% linked quarter, primarily as
a result of higher incentive-based compensation from insurance revenue growth.
For the full year 2023, we now expect revenues to increase 5% to 7% compared to 2022. The decline from our
previous outlook is driven almost entirely by a lower net interest income outlook given higher deposit and funding
costs. Adjusted expenses are still expected to increase between 5% and 7%. As I indicated earlier, we remain
focused on taking actions throughout the year to reduce costs.

Excluded from our adjusted expense outlook are two items. First, we are not including the impact of any potential
incremental FDIC surcharge or assessment. After we receive clarity, we'll provide an update on estimated impact.
Secondly, there will be some one-time costs occurring in 2023 and 2024 tied to preparing Truist Insurance
Holdings to transition its operating model to be more independent, which is consistent with its new capital
structure. These expenses directly correlate to realizing significant value in the business over time. We will not
adjust for these expenses in our results, but we will provide transparency.
Our goal is still to produce positive operating leverage and positive adjusted PPNR growth for the full year
excluding these two items. The degree of difficulty has increased relative to January given higher funding costs.
Our expectations for the net charge-off ratio to be between 35 and basis points (sic) [35 and 50 basis points] for
the full year is unchanged.
Lastly, excluding discrete items, we now expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 20%, which translates
to approximately 22% on a taxable equivalent basis, due to our adoption of recent accounting guidance regarding
the amortization of new market tax credits. This change simply shifts contra revenue in other income to the tax
expense line and has no impact on the bottom line.
Now, I'll hand it back to Bill for some final remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers Jr.
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Great. Thanks, Mike. So, to conclude on slide 19, Truist is on the right path, and I'm highly optimistic about our
ability to realize our significant post-integration potential as summarized in our investment thesis. Our goal
financially is to produce strong growth and profitability and to do so with less volatility than our peers.
As we began to shift from integrating to operating several quarters ago, we also made a strategic decision to
focus our resources on areas where we have an advantage in the marketplace and are most synergistic with our
core strengths. Since that time, we focused on product solutions and distinctive experiences that are most
relevant to our primary consumer and deposit households into our commercial, corporate and high net-worth
clients while reducing our investment in businesses and clients that are less strategically relevant with respect to
returns on relationship opportunities.
We believe these changes are consistent with where the banking industry is likely to go from here. We're already
realizing the early benefits of this shift. For instance, first quarter net new consumer checking account production
was among the best we've seen since becoming Truist, driven by our continued focus on core deposit clients, the
attractiveness of new products including Truist One, and improved retention, as well as flight to quality.
Branch checking account production has increased 13% since the launch of Truist One and, as I said earlier, has
accelerated up to 18% compared to a year ago in the first quarter. The steady improvement we've seen in client
satisfaction has been driven by the distinct service our branch and care agents provide, as well as improvements
in our digital processes and procedures that originated in our Client Journey Rooms. As I indicated earlier, I'm
really proud of the care our teammates provided to our clients in March and this is reflected in higher Voice of
Client scores during the last few weeks of the quarter.
Lastly, we continued to advance our Integrated Relationship Management program by establishing long-term
growth targets for our most strategic IRM partnerships, details of which I shared in December. Relative to the first
quarter of last year, these strategic partnerships have grown revenues by 35%. At the same time, we

acknowledge that the environment's tougher and strong balance sheet and expense management remain critical
for our stakeholders.
In closing, while uncertainty has increased, Truist is in a position of strength across a broad range of outcomes
because of our diverse business mix, dynamic markets, conservative credit culture, balanced approach to interest
rate risk management, strong profitability profile, and our strong risk-adjusted capital position. I am truly optimistic
about the future of Truist, as our more than 50,000 talented teammates build on our momentum to create
distinctive client experiences and deliver on our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities.
So, with that, Ankur, let me turn it back over to you for Q&A.

Great. Thank you, Bill. Alley, at this time, will you explain to our listeners how they can participate in the Q&A
session? As you do that, I'd like to ask the participant to limit yourselves to one primary question and one follow-

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just wanted to start just on the deposit front, good color you gave in terms of the
relationships. You mentioned in the deck that end-of-period was down 2% and some of that was seasonal. So,
just wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on just how you saw deposits end the quarter, and if you've
seen stabilization and what kind of outlook you just see for the flow and mix of deposits from here. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Good morning, Ken. It's Mike. That's right, we saw really throughout the course of the quarter relatively
stable flows. Actually if you think about sort of where we saw our balances evolve throughout the first two months
of the quarter, very typical, we saw some seasonal outflows related to public funds, we saw the expected impact
of qualitative tightening which we've seen throughout the previous couple of quarters. And so, we're probably
down about 1% or so.
And then in the last month of the quarter, we really saw continued public fund outflows, we saw a little bit of higher
rate-pursuant behavior, we saw people cycling into money market accounts to a higher extent. We saw some of
our wealth clients cycle into investment accounts and ended down about 2% for the quarter. I'd say the bulk of the
money in movement happened during that week that Bill mentioned in our opening remarks.
As far as outlook is concerned, it's been business as usual and steady since really that first week in March. And
what – our expectation frankly is that the impacts that were driving some pressure in the fourth quarter and the
first two-thirds of the first quarter will continue to put pressure on deposits probably to the tune of 1% to 2%.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And just my follow-up is just then what about that mix and how do you expect that mix of DDAs to total as
there is more cycling of that? I think you're down to about 32% in the first quarter. What do you think...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
...you had previously said you [ph] felt you (00:33:57) could approach that 30%over time. Has that view changed
at all given what's happened?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Yeah, Ken, this is Bill. Pre-COVID, we were sort of at 29%. As you mentioned, we're around 32% now.
We're going to clearly migrate down to that high-20s and sort of depending upon where rates are, I think that [ph]
sort of is the (00:34:20) stabilization level as based upon what we know right now.
Just to add to what Mike said as well and continue to just focus on the positive side of the retail deposit
production, I just expect that engine to continue. So, while – sort of on balance, we might be down flattish to down
1-or-so percent. That includes a really good positive production momentum we have in our core franchise.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
I'm wondering if you could – could you talk about how you're thinking about the potential impact of tougher LCR
requirements and [indiscernible] (00:35:15) be announced in the near future, and how should we think about your
debt issuance plans and other potential impacts?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
I'd say from a TLAC perspective, this is something that we've had our eyes on for a number of quarters and the
entire industry has, certainly, companies our size. We've studied the framework, we've previously probably were
considering tailored versions of TLAC, perhaps that will ultimately be the case. But in the abundance of caution
and the framework that we've assessed is sort of a traditionally applied framework, the same that the largest
banks in the country have applied. And from our perspective, our regular way issuance, certainly given some
reasonable phase-in period will allow Truist to comply really without much effort.
And to your question around debt issuance, you saw we raised $3 billion in January. Our expectation, given
Truist's scale and funding needs and perspective, is that we'll be a relatively regular issuer and to the extent that
we get a better sense for what's eligible and not eligible from a TLAC perspective, that may influence how we
issue, whether it's at the holding company or the opco, but I think the net of it is that we feel really well-prepared
and positioned to comply with TLAC to the extent that that's applied to Truist.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Blake Netter Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And separately, just one more question from me. Service charges on deposits came down sequentially this
quarter. Can you talk about the potential for overdraft fees to get even lower from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. They're going to continue to get lower. Blake, we instituted our Truist One, which is sort of the – a big part
of the deposit generation and new client acquisition, but it's also our no overdraft fee account. So, those will
continue to draft lower and those are in all of our guidance and everything that we talked about, and they're
basically right on path where we thought they'd be.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Hey, good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Back to the deposit growth expectation, just want to confirm, down 1% to 2%. Is that on end-of-period balances
and is that for the full year, your expectation? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. That's a quarterly view, and I'm not sure that's going to sort of be linear in its progression. If we think about
just the impact of qualitative tightening and some of the work that we've done and certainly prior to this first
quarter was just getting a sense for our share of the easing and how that may impact our share of the tightening.
And so, that 1% to 2% is reflective of QT continuing on a quarterly basis and it's also reflective of, frankly, [ph] just
the (00:38:26) rate environment that we're in, as people continue to assess bank alternative products where
perhaps higher rates or investment products are an alternative. That's a quarterly view.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Got it, Mike. Thank you. And then separately also on the margin and deposit dynamics, can you maybe talk
to us about how you see this playing out in terms of the net interest margin progression from here? And then also,
what do you expect is a fair through-cycle deposit beta? I know you're currently at 36% and I want to hear your
thoughts there? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Sure. And we mentioned in our prepared remarks our net interest margin – in the first quarter, we were down on a
reported basis about 8 basis points and that really had two primary drivers: The first was, we also mentioned that
we have a little bit more liquidity on the balance sheet. That was something that we made the decision to do sort
of in the abundance of caution. And so, while that doesn't really have an impact on NII because there is very sort
of de minimis negative carry relative to the funding cost there, it did swell the size of the balance sheet a bit, so
the denominator impact drove about 2 basis points of net interest margin decline. And then, we also had just the
overall funding mix shift which probably drove the bulk of the rest. There is also a basis point in there for PAA.
Those same factors that drove our NIM down 8 basis points in the first quarter exist in the second quarter as well,
perhaps to – and to some extent in terms of the behaviors, maybe it'll be a little bit more modest. But you also
have to quarterize some of those impacts. And so, our expectation is that NIM probably has downside of another,
call it, 12 basis points in the second quarter.
As far as the second half, probably have a more stable outlook for the NIM. We've mentioned before that we've
sort of intentionally approached a more neutral kind of rate sensitivity position, but I think beyond that, it's really

going to depend on some of these other factors, the betas, the mix that Bill just talked about on the DDA side.
Whether or not we see credit spreads widen as an example is a factor too.
The beta that we have in our assumption around NII and NIM – you mentioned, we're at 36% today, that – until
now, we've been exceeding our expectations. This is the first quarter where we performed a little worse than we
expected. Our spot beta today, on a IBD basis, is 40%. We expect that to migrate to the low-40s for the full
second quarter, and we have a terminal outlook of 44%.

Operator: Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. I'm not sure if I should keep pushing the Corvette analogy here, but it just looks like the fuel efficiency isn't
quite as good. I don't know if you've put diesel fuel in the Corvette by mistake or what the – you closed 117
branches in the first quarter, so that should be good. You're getting other merger benefits. You've completed the
integration phase and you guide for 5% to 7% revenue growth which is decent, but also 5% to 7% expense
growth. And I – isn't this the time when you go back to your management team and say, hey, you know, we're
getting more cautious on lending as you indicated and we need to tighten some of the – this expense spend. And
I get some of the expenses are FDIC and pension, minimum wage, but that's true to some of your peers which
are looking for positive operating leverage. And I know you said positive operating leverage [ph] but then you
have (00:42:39) 5% to 7% higher both for revenues and expenses. So, just give a little bit more color about the
efficiency of Truist as you transition from integration to growth. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Great. And Mike, I am going to spare from the Corvette analogy, just try to sort of go right at it. As Mike said, I
mean, we're really – we're going to continue to focus on positive operating leverage. The revenue guidance is
really an NII guidance issue, our continued focus on the insurance, investment banking, all the other things that
comprise that, we're still very confident of. And hopefully if markets really improve in the second half of the year,
might even have some upside. But your point on the expense side is exactly right. I mean, we have, call it, 4% or
so sort of embedded in the categories that you talked about. So, the ability to manage is in that other component
of that. And trust me, every business leader has a positive operating leverage plan, and they are readjusting
those plans based on – particularly those that have an NII component to their plans and the things that they can
do.
You saw already this quarter things that we're doing that are more reflective of the strategy. You talked about the
realignment of fixed income, consolidation of LightStream. I mean, in the past, these might have been things that
sort of would have been off the table, now they're firmly on the table like everything else as it relates to expenses.
We'll do more work in the mortgage area, all the things with spans and layers, real estate, digitization, automation,

all of that is firmly on the table and a clear focus for us as we move into the rest of this year with a keen focus and
eye on positive operating leverage.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then one separate question, do you plan to rebrand LightStream to Truist? And if so, does that mean
you're going to have more of a national branding strategy?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And it's interesting, you are in the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic with Truist and you go outside the region with a different
brand, so I'm just trying to reconcile your brand names.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Really sort of same way around actually. So, we're really – we're going to eventually wind down the
LightStream brand and increase the Truist side of that. We created LightStream for completely different reasons
that don't really exist today as it relates to Truist. So, we've got this incredible franchise, incredible market, really
good digital capabilities and what we're doing now is saying let's say bring all of those digital capabilities, really
fast turnaround times, incredible Net Promoter Scores with LightStream to all of the Truist client base. So, the
emphasis will be on the Truist client base and then also with partnerships that are Truist clients rather than sort of
this national brand.
So, I'm pleased with what we did. I think we did all the right things, we created this really cool capability. But the
comment I made earlier, we were also supporting a separate brand and that has a lot of expense associated with
it. There's a lot of marketing and other things with that, and we're having incredible success with the Truist brand.
So, we want to bring it under that umbrella, create some more efficiencies from an expense standpoint and then I
think accelerate from a revenue standpoint and penetrating and further cementing these incredible deposit
relationships we have.

Good morning.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
You mentioned that you – good morning – you're anticipating tighter capital and liquidity standards. And Bill, as
you think about growing your capital from here, your starting point is 9.1%, do you feel like the build is now closer
to 9.5% and 10% as you anticipate higher capital and liquidity standards? And if so, how should we think about
your plans for dividend growth? I suspect that buybacks would be lowest priority. And also, is there is some RWA
mitigation that you could do in order to perhaps speed up that 20 basis points of organic capital generation?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Erika, thanks. Remember, we are actually at 9.4% today as we've completed the interest in Truist
Insurance Holdings. So, if we start with there, I mean, the mode we're in right now, I mean, we're comfortable
where our capital level is. But we're in a capital-build mode right now until we're not. So, we want to really
understand the landscape, understand the regulatory landscape, be prepared. We've got 20 basis points or so of
sort of organic capital accretion that comes into play, that's post our dividend. Our dividend will continue to be
important to us and we'll continue to support our dividend.
So, I think we've got – we're at a good place right now with capital. We'll continue to be in a little bit of a capital-
build mode. So, we'll sort of blow through that 9.5% number you mentioned here in several quarters and then we'll
see. We'll just sort of see where the regulatory things line up and the opportunities that we have. And I think we've
got the most organic combined with financial and strategic flexibility on capital to respond to sort of anything that
might come our way.
You did mention, though, and our focus is going to continue to be on supporting organic growth. We're going to
maximize RWA, but we don't need to reduce RWA. So, we don't need to change RWA from a capital standpoint,
but we do want to optimize it. We do want to create more velocity around RWA, which I talked about. Dividend
being important and then M&A on particularly things like insurance and then capabilities to create sustainable

advantages. And then, as you mentioned, share repurchase is just not in our short-term window. I mean, that's
just not our focus right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And my second question is – sorry to make this another car analogy, but a 24% ROTCE is more like an F1
car rather than a Corvette, right? But the conversation on your AFS portfolio that was [ph] brewing (00:50:04) over
the quarter aside, it feels like some of what's holding down your valuation is the puts and takes, the specials that
keep coming up. And I wonder, though, where are you in terms of the optimization of this franchise?
Because it's pretty clear that the steps that you have been taking and it seems like based on Mike's laundry list
that you guys are accelerating, has everything to do with optimization of this franchise, and I wonder how you're
weighing sort of pulling forward that optimization and – I mean, look, there's always a continuous improvement
process for every company, right? But is it better to just clean everything up this year and perhaps for the sake of
positive operating leverage, to think about cleaner 2024 and 2025 numbers when it comes to expenses? Because
I do think that it's very clear what the potential of this franchise is, but there's always adjustments here and there,
and so I feel that your investors are less likely to see that visibility on that expense curve bend that you guys are
aiming for.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, maybe – let me try to break that up into two components if I understood the question. So, if the question's
around the strategic parts of our business and optimizing those, you are seeing a little bit of an acceleration
around there. That's not sort of a dramatic shift, but you are seeing a speed-up on that and it's things around the
edges. And I talked a little bit about those today. There's some more of those that we're thinking through because,
as you note, I mean, our core franchise is so powerful, and what we want to do is make sure that the resources
that we have at this company are devoted towards growing, expanding that incredible franchise.
So, the things that we talked about, about capital markets and LightStream, I think, are really good examples of
those. And you could argue they were probably a little accelerated maybe with a small A of accelerating. If you're
going to the balance sheet side, are we going to do anything on the securities portfolio, the answer to that is not at
this time. I mean, there's just not a really good economic benefit for that and we want to be long-term protectors of
shareholder value. And so, I think we'll stay the course there unless something were to change dramatically that
would cause us to change our posture.

Yeah. [ph] Just wondering if (00:52:53) – just a follow-up. It seems as if you have optimized and accelerated
some of the initiatives, and I'm wondering if you can tell your investors that your goal for 2024 is really sort cleaner
quarters on expenses so that they could really see that expense curve in terms of your GAAP EPS power.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think relative to the first part of that, yes, that would be the goal and I think they're getting cleaner every
quarter and they're going to continue to stay on that flight path. But when we have opportunities that we think are
long-term beneficial, we're not going to miss those. But I think your basic statement of will we have a cleaner
quarter process in 2024, yes, and I think they get cleaner every quarter along that path.

Mike – and maybe this is more directed to Clarke on credit. You guys have very strong credit quality obviously,
but you perked my interest with something that you said in the prepared remarks that your charge-offs, again,
they're low, went up by 3 basis points. But you cited C&I, which was interesting to me. So, the question is, what –
and then you also pointed out that the allowance, of course, was built up for CRE, but you talked about reducing
your risk appetite in selected areas. So, where are those areas, number one? And then in C&I, if you guys could
elaborate what – maybe what happened there and any comments also about your leveraged loan portfolio that I
assume is included in C&I as well?

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
So, as far as what areas are we focused, and first and foremost, what I'd say is that we want to maintain our
through-the-cycle lending approach as we always have for our clients. So, we're not going to make dramatic shifts
in our appetite or how we lend. We just want to be more cautious and prudent where it makes sense. So, things
like less exceptions, more due diligence. And some of the areas we're focusing right now would be the ones you
would expect, higher leverage, so leveraged finance would be one, things like senior care given the market
aspects of CRE, lower-end consumer, things like that, Gerard. So, I think it's more around being cautious, but
being consistent there for our clients.
And to your other question, our leverage book is performing very well right now. So, I would just remind you all the
portion that you would be focused on is about 3.6% of our total loans, portfolio is 50% investment grade. We've
very modest hold levels. Our leverage multiples have come down over the last couple of years in that book and
right now, it's performing very well. We have NPLs at 0.6%, our NCOs are at 0.11%. So, very good overall
performance.
And then as far as the C&I losses in Q1, there's nothing episodic there. We're coming off such extremely low
levels – if we go back into 2022, we were in the – just a couple of basis point range and we're up just a more
toward a normalized range, so nothing specific there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. Thank you, Clarke. And then following up, Mike, I mean, you talked about the investment banking
business, how you've built it out with some strategic hires over the last two years. And we know from the market
conditions, from some of your larger competitors, it's challenging out there. Are you guys comfortable with your
revenue to expense area in investment banking now, or do you really want to see – or need the revenues to kind
of really pickup as the market continues to pick up?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael B. Maguire A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, I'll start there and maybe Bill may have something to add, but the investment banking business is
performing well. It was a bright spot for us in the first quarter. We have expectations that it will continue to perform
well, pipelines remain solid. And I think that a lot of that is driven by the fact that we've been adding really high-
caliber sort of franchise-type talent to that platform, not just recently, but consistently over the years.
And so – look, I mean, there is no doubt about it. There's market interruptions, transaction markets, deal markets
are a little harder, but in sort of the middle market and upper-middle market space where we feel like we've really
got a powerful franchise, we continue to get deals done for our clients on the corporate and sponsor side. And so,
we're still very supportive and optimistic about the investment banking business and look, we're managing it
carefully and revenues will be highly correlated with expenses in that business, but that's always been the case.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers Jr. A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. And for us [ph] I mean (00:58:12) to your margin question, investment banking, that's always been a good
margin business and has had a lot of discipline over a long period of time. And part of that sustainability, I think
you saw some of it this quarter, is – back to the earlier comments and questions we're having about the strength
in the franchise, so being able to take advantage of this incredible franchise and client base really afford us this
opportunity all across, high-grade, debt and equity, IRM revenue being up. So, it just creates more consistency
and more confidence for us in that revenue base.

John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Hi. Good morning. I know we're running tight, maybe we could get a comment from John about the operating
environment for insurance this year and then also if you could add on your thoughts about utilizing the increased
optionality that the transaction's gotten and what the M&A environment looks like for you. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Howard A
Chief Insurance Officer and Chairman & Chief Executive Officer-Truist Insurance Holdings, Truist Financial Corp.
Sure, John [indiscernible] (00:59:28)

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Hey, John, do you want to [indiscernible] (00:59:31)?

John M. Howard A
Chief Insurance Officer and Chairman & Chief Executive Officer-Truist Insurance Holdings, Truist Financial Corp.
Sure, John. This is John Howard. Thank you very much for the question. When I look at the environment from an
insurance standpoint, it continues to be favorable, pricing continues to be firm. If you think about insured values
and you think about insured rates, they're both affected by the inflationary environment that we're experiencing.
Those are tailwinds for us. There are some capacity headwinds, particularly around catastrophe-exposed
property, but net-net, we'll continue to see good organic growth in insurance. And I do expect our organic growth
to improve over the course of the year. And to your question about acquisitions, the market response to the Stone
Point transaction has been very positive. So, we've gotten great feedback from teammates, clients, insurance
companies, business partners, as well as acquisition candidates. So, I think we're very well positioned.
