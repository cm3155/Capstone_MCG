Q1 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
Thanks a lot, Emlen. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. It
was an eventful quarter as we close our merger [indiscernible] (00:01:03) with Sterling, executed on our
integration plan and announced and completed the acquisition of Bend Financial, all while continuing to generate
solid performance in our underlying businesses.
I'll begin with some high level remarks on the macro environment, our performance for the first quarter of 2022
and I'll provide a quick update on the merger. I'll turn it over to Glenn after that to review our financials, the
financial effects of the merger, and to provide our outlook for full year 2022.
Despite uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment driven by war in Ukraine, supply chain, labor market
challenges and the lingering impacts of COVID and some of you may have seen the 1.4% surprising GDP
contraction this morning, we feel that the underlying strength in economic activity remains strong. Demand for
debt financing and continued confidence among our clients is prevalent. And our base case continues to call for
solid economic growth, rising interest rates, and positive trending in loan demand over the next six to eight
quarters.
We are very pleased with our performance in Q1. Our reported net income was a loss of $20 million and EPS was
a loss of $0.14. These results, however, were impacted by various onetime merger related charges, including the
non-PCD double count provision for Sterling. Excluding these merger related expenses, adjusted net income was
$184 million and adjusted earnings per share was $1.24. Those adjusted metrics equate to 1.37% return on
assets, and a return on common tangible equity of 17%.
Loans and deposits grew smartly year-over-year driving material revenue growth. We effectively manage
expenses and our efficiency ratio was approximately 49% for the quarter. Credit performance continues to be
favorable, excluding the non-PCD provision included in the merger accounting, our provision for the quarter was
$14 million. All credit metrics remained strong, including our NPL and total loans ratio at 57 basis points period
end, down from 71 basis points for stand-alone Webster a year ago.
I'm now on slide 3. We closed our merger on January 31. We're excited to be operating as a combined
organization and believe our combination is as strategically compelling today as it was when we announced it a
year ago. We now have $65 billion in assets, $54 billion in deposits, and $44 billion in loans as a combined
company. As was our intent at the outset, we have created a commercially focused bank that we believe can
outperform as we leverage our significant expertise, industry verticals, and broad asset generation capabilities.
Our funding and liquidity profile is a differentiated strength for Webster as our diversified sources of low beta
deposits, including from our HSA Bank franchise should provide a competitive advantage as interest rates rise
and liquidity returns to more normalized levels. Our loan to deposit ratio of 80% provides ample flexibility for us
going forward. In combination with a predominantly floating rate loan portfolio, we expect significant income
improvement in a rising interest rate environment.
Our tangible book value per share and capital levels at close were roughly in line with our expectations at merger
announcement. We expect to achieve $60 million in realized cost sales in 2022 and another $60 million of savings
for the full year 2023. We've begun the consolidation of our corporate real estate footprint and expect to reduce
our combined corporate square footage by over 40% by the end of the year. We've eliminated redundant
operating costs were identified and at quarter end of the combined organization was operating at 93% of its head
count relative to merger announcement a year ago.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
We expect to complete the core banking systems conversion in the third quarter of 2023. All customer facing
rebranding has been completed. In combination with the financial merits of the deal and strong business
execution, we are well on the path to sustainably generating the targeted financial metrics we set forth a year ago
at deal announcement, including a high teens return on tangible common equity.
With respect to outstanding people, we have seen effectively no attrition among client-facing colleagues due to
the merger or the competitive labor market. And in fact, we've added additional commercial bankers and have a
pipeline of teams and portfolios that we believe will help us sustain our growth momentum.
Slide 5 covers loans. We have great business momentum heading into the second quarter. Excluding the effects
of TPP and the material contraction in mortgage warehouse balances due to the rate environment, linked-quarter
loan growth for the two legacy entities combined with 1.5% or 6% annualized. Year-over-year growth on the same
basis was 8.5%. Growth was driven primarily by commercial categories as anticipated. As we have discussed
with many of you, our increased balance sheet capacity allows us to immediately expand relationships with our
existing customer base.
As a proof point, at year-end 2021, the combined banks had a total of 109 relationships with exposure greater
than $40 million. With a bigger balance sheet, since legal day one of the merger on January 31, we pre-screened
61 deals and approved 27 deals with exposures over $40 million. The higher hold trend has contributed to our
confidence in reaching our 8% to 10% 2022 full year loan growth targets. We feel good about our ability to
leverage our bigger balance sheet without sacrificing credit quality and without expanding our existing
underwriting guidelines.
Of note, the weighted average risk rating of our top 100 exposures is more than half a turn better than that of our
overall loan portfolio. Asset quality improves as whole levels increase. Deposits on a combined basis also
exhibited solid growth this quarter, up 3.2% on a linked-quarter basis and up almost 4% year-over-year. Our
deposit cost declined 1 basis point despite the start of fed tightening and higher market rates broadly.
Growth this quarter was principally driven by HSA and our government banking business. HSA added 288,000
new accounts and core deposits increased almost $0.5 billion. As mentioned earlier, we closed on our acquisition
of Bend this quarter, which we view as another proof point with respect to the merger, providing additional
opportunities to accelerate growth in low-cost, long-duration HSA deposits.
With that, I'll turn it over to Glenn.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes
Executive Vice President-Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with our period-end balance sheet on slide 7. At period
end, our total loans were $43.5 billion, total assets were $65.1 billion, and total deposits were $54.4 billion. On a
pro forma basis, linked-quarter loan growth was led by $442 million in sponsor and specialty and $255 million in
C&I, this was partially offset by declines in mortgage warehouse and PPP.
Pro forma deposits increased $1.7 billion or 3% linked-quarter with growth across all categories except higher
cost CDs. Borrowings ended the period at $1.6 billion. Capital ratios continue to be exceptionally strong post-
merger with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.4% and the tangible common equity ratio of 8.3%. At merger
announcement, we had estimated a pro forma common equity tier 1 ratio of 11.3% at close. Tangible book value
per common share was $28.94, down from $30.22 last quarter, a number of factors contributed to the decline,
including merger accounting, merger related charges, and the impact of AFS securities valuation marks on AOCI.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
Moving on to slide 8, we detail the various merger and restructuring adjustments for the quarter, including a
reversal of approved strategic initiative expenses, merger related expenses, and the non-PCD double count
provision. In aggregate, these three items attracted $1.38 from EPS for the quarter.
On slide 9, we provided a reported to adjusted and pro forma income statement which includes the January
adjusted results for Sterling. The January Sterling performance is excluded from our reported results as it
occurred prior to the closing of the merger. On an adjusted basis, we reported $184 million of net income
available to common or $1.24 in diluted earnings per share in the quarter. Our pre-provision net revenue was
$242.9 million.
Our return on assets was 1.37%. Return on tangible common equity was 17%, and we had an efficiency ratio of
48.7%. I will point out that our adjusted performance benefited from the deferred tax valuation adjustment of $10
million in the quarter, which is reflected in the effective tax rate of 18%. As John highlighted earlier, we feel very
good about the trajectory of our returns given where we are in the integration process. On the next three slides,
we have provided trends on pro forma income statement categories to give you a better sense of the starting
point as we head into the second quarter.
Slide 10 shows our net interest income for the quarter. $464 million in total net interest income includes $394
million reported for Webster and $70 million for Sterling in January. This includes $36 million in purchase
accounting accretion. The pro forma net interest margin for the quarter was 3.24%, while the net interest margin,
excluding the effects of purchase accounting was 2.98%.
Non-interest income is presented on slide 11. Non-interest income is again presented on a pro forma combined
basis, including Sterling's January non-interest income. When combining Webster's reported non-interest income
of $104 million for Q1, with $11 million for Sterling in January, the total is $115 million. The linked-quarter decline
from Q4 reflects lower investment gains of $11 million realized at Webster and $5 million at Sterling. In addition,
we recognized lower wealth management and mortgage banking fee income.
Non-interest expense is presented on slide 12. Webster reported $255 million in adjusted expenses and Sterling's
January adjusted expenses were $46 million, which totaled to $301.5 million. On a linked-quarter basis, the
general trend in non-interest expense was driven by a decrease in Q4 performance-based expenses, which was
partially offset by seasonal benefit expenses and intangible amortization. Total intangible amortization on a pro
forma basis was $4.9 million in each of the prior periods compared to $7.5 million in Q1 2022.
Moving on to our allowance on slide 13, the allowance totaled $569 million for the quarter, largely driven by
merger-related accounting. The net PCD allowance for Sterling added $88 million and was marked through the
balance sheet. The PCD allowance adjustment is the net of $136 million in gross PCD reserves was $48 million in
charge-offs recognized at acquisition, reflecting balances written off by Sterling in prior periods.
The non-PCD provision added $175 million. In accordance with purchase accounting, this is recognized as a
provision through the income statement. This commonly referred to as the double count as the assets are both
marked on the balance sheets and income statement. The balance of our increase was the net effect of $9 million
charge-offs and $14 million provision expense.
Slide 14, we provide our key asset quality metrics. As John indicated earlier, our asset quality remains strong,
including an NPL ratio of 57 basis points and the commercial classified loans totaling 213 basis points of the

commercial portfolio. This compares to 62 basis points and 226 basis points respectively on a combined basis at
year end.
On slide 15, we are exceptionally well-positioned from a capital perspective. Our regulatory capital ratios exceed
well capitalized levels by substantial amounts. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.4% exceeds well capitalized
by $2.4 billion and our Tier 1 risk-based capital of 12% exceeds well capitalized by $1.9 billion. Our tangible book
value per share of $28.94 is up $0.53 from prior year.
Slide 16 provides our estimated purchase accounting marks at close relative to expectations at merger
announcement. Loan marks totaled $317 million compared to $381 million anticipated at announcement including
March related to credit, interest, and liquidity. Our security mark of $60 million is lower than the originally
anticipated mark of $102 million driven by the higher rate environment. The core deposit intangible is estimated at
$119 million versus $106 million at announcement, again, driven by higher rates. We've also added $91 million of
intangibles for customer relationships related to reoccurring revenue portfolios in our Commercial Bank segment.
The property and equipment mark was $23 million. Goodwill and other intangibles totaled $2.1 billion, in line with
the announcement.
On slide 17, we have provided the expected income statement impacts of the merger. In accordance with
acquisition accounting, Sterling's previously scheduled yield accretion and intangible amortization are eliminated.
In the first quarter, we realized $34.7 million of purchase accounting accretion in net interest income. Our
scheduled accretion for the calendar year is $73.5 million. In the first quarter, purchase accounting accretion
benefited the net interest margin by 29 basis points. With respect to intangible asset amortization, Webster
reported $6.4 million in intangible amortization in Q1, which includes $5.2 million related to the merger. Total
intangible amortization will be $9 million for Q2, including the full effect of the merger and legacy amortization.
On slide 18, we provide our full year outlook. Each of these items assumes no material change in the
macroeconomic or regulatory environment. We expect net interest income of $1.85 billion on a GAAP basis,
excluding accretion. Our projection assumes the Fed funds rate end the year at 2.5%, implying an additional 200
basis points of rate increases.
Our net interest income projection also anticipates loans grow at 8% to 10% annually, beginning from our legal
day one balances of $43.3 billion. We expect fee income of $430 million to 450 million, and expenses excluding
onetime cost of $1.1 billion to $1.12 billion, so we continue to monitor inflationary headwinds. We anticipate an
effective tax rate in the range of 22% to 23% going forward.
With that, I'll turn things back over to John for closing remarks.

Thanks, Glenn. When Jack Kopnisky and I decided to embark on the merger of our two companies, in addition to
the financial merits of the transaction, there were several aspects to this merger that made it particularly
compelling. Including the ability to elevate the best talents from both organizations, the alignment and
complementary nature of the lending verticals a uniquely valuable funding base and scale that would allow us to
accelerate investment in differentiated businesses.
Already in the first few months as a combined company, we are executing on the strategic benefits we felt this
merger will provide. We're elevating the best talent from both organizations. The executive management
committee is a balanced group coming from each legacy organization. We're committed to building a

contemporary and values-based culture in the new organization. The leadership team has coalesced around and
agreed upon set of core values and respected behaviors. These have been followed on into a culture-shaping
program already rolled out across the bank. Our company and our colleagues are committed to outstanding
corporate citizenship, and I encourage you to read our recently published ESG Report available on our website.
As previously highlighted, we had solid loan originations and net loan growth in key commercial segments, and
we are immediately realizing on the ability to execute on larger transactions, particularly on our differentiated
Sponsor & Specialty and institutional commercial real estate business. We have an exceptional low cost sticky
deposit base led by HSA Bank and the consumer banking network of the combined organization. We were able to
reduce our cost of deposits by 1 basis point this quarter, and continue to explore new customer verticals and
digital delivery channels that should further enhance our funding position.
We're investing in digital capabilities. We saw a couple of examples in the first quarter. As previously mentioned,
we purchased Bend Financial, a cloud-based solutions provider in the HSA space. We're excited about the
technology Bend brings to our platform and the business benefits its client-facing experience will provide. In
addition, through our innovations group, Webster joined the USDF Consortium as a founding member. The
consortium will work to support like-minded, forward-thinking banks as they work to integrate blockchain
capabilities into their operations. As an active and engaged participant in the consortium's activities, we will
benefit from the pooled expertise and network effects of other members.
We will continue to invest in our data environment and migrate our digital platforms to the cloud. We expect to
generate significant returns and excess capital at a combined organization as we set forth at the merger
announcement a year ago. This will provide us with significant capital flexibility going forward. We'll continue to be
disciplined in our capital management framework, allocating capital to those businesses and activities that
generate the highest return on equity.
We will deploy capital into differentiated and growing organic activities first and into commercial loan portfolios
and select inorganic business or product acquisitions, like we did with Bend. We'll also continue to return capital
to our shareholders in the absence of organic opportunities through dividends and share repurchases. In Q1, we
repurchased over 120 million in shares and have replenished our repurchase authorization as announced
yesterday.
Finally, I want to thank all of our Webster colleagues for their engagement, efforts and execution. We've asked a
lot of every colleague over the last year as we were preparing for the merger close and delivering outstanding
performance in a challenging macro environment. Our colleagues stepped up and delivered for our clients, our
communities, and for our shareholders.
With that, Glenn and I are prepared to take questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Chris McGratty with KBW. Please
proceed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thanks for the question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Hey, Chris.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Glenn – hey, Glenn. Maybe start on the expense. The guide was pretty much in line with what we are looking for.
I'm just interested in kind of the cadence as you realize the $60 million of cost saves this year and $60 million next
year. Where do expenses effectively go to over the next four, five quarters and then we'll lift from there once the
synergies are less?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President-Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Thanks, Chris, and good morning. Let me give you a little more texture on the $60 million, because I can
say we have a pretty clear sight on how we're going to achieve that. And it sort of falls in three categories: the
elimination of redundancies; the consolidation of corporate facilities, as you probably heard John note in his
remarks, the 45% reduction of square footage; and then operational efficiencies from the consolidation of vendor
contracts, operating systems and automation. So, we gave you guidance that sort of gets us to $1.1 billion to
$1.12 billion.
And I would say that the trajectory is probably going to get us to a range in the range of like a 2.85% by the fourth
quarter. I want to sort of preface that with that in the fourth quarter, we have basically – we do traditionally have a
spike in HSA type of expenses, somewhat offset by lower employee comp-related costs on the healthcare and
things like that. So, that's a range, I would say. That that would be your jump-off range in the fourth quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then, from there, there's still a little bit more, I guess, to go for 2023. But there's always – there's also
inflationary pressure. So...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President-Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, look, we're sticking with the achieving the additional $60 million in 2023. The big driver of that will be
the completion of our core banking conversion, which will generate significant savings. And then, well, as you
would expect, we'll get a full-year run rate of a lot of the initiatives that we executed this year.

Wanted to touch, I guess, slide 5, the loan growth. Obviously, a little bit slower this quarter. But I guess, could you
just give us some color on the mix, lots of moving parts here. C&I very good, Sponsor & Specialty also very good,
is this a similar mix that we can get to expect in the remaining quarters to get to that 8% to 10%? And then also,
Sponsor & Specialty, I know John you really love that vertical, what is the limit on that concentration-wise?

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's great question, Casey. And you can probably hear that on – obviously the contraction in mortgage
warehouse and runoff of PPE is what sort of muted the gap reported loan growth. But obviously, for me, the
underlying characteristics on page 5 are strong because the proof point on this transaction was in our institutional
real estate, C&I and Sponsor & Specialty that we had a lot of momentum. And with a bigger balance sheet, we
were going to be able to accelerate loan growth. And that's why I'm still pretty confident.
Mortgage warehouse is about $500 million in balances right now. We don't see that contracting much more during
this kind of purchasing season. And kind of our general thought is that that $500 million would be a good average
balance for that business for the rest of the year. So, neither a big driver of growth nor a drag. But as you noted,
our originations were really strong across C&I, Sponsor & Specialty and actually in CRE.
We just had an inordinate amount of prepayments. It sort of spilled over from the fourth quarter in investor CRE.
So, a lot of momentum there and I think as we talked about when we announced this deal, our Sponsor &
Specialty business on our $20 billion loan portfolio is a stand-alone legacy Webster Company. We were sort of
saying to ourselves, hey, are we reaching maybe a threshold of concentration? And now and on the other side,
from a legacy Sterling perspective, we had a relative concentration of commercial real estate. You look at this $43
billion loan portfolio and the granular nature of all these categories, we really have significant running room to
expand in all of these categories.
So, that 11% growth in a single quarter in Sponsor is terrific. Again, some of that was because of lower
prepayments. I wouldn't pencil that in, but we expect General C&I across all the middle market businesses,
investor CRE, and Sponsor & Specialty to continue to grow smartly from a good pipeline, stronger loan demand,
and a bigger balance sheet. So, that's why I think the underlying numbers here from a loan growth perspective
are not discouraging because of the geography of what sort of muted the growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. Okay, great. And then, on the buyback, you guys announced a $600 million renewal last night ahead of that
– $120 million in the quarter, ahead of that $400 million or so expectation, a deal announcement. Can you just
give us some updated thoughts on your buyback appetite going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. I think we're going to continue to be disciplined and opportunistic. The environment's a bit choppy.
Obviously, we had the increased authorization, which makes sense given the size of our company and moving
forward. And as I articulated, I think our first products for us is outsized loan growth, portfolio purchases, team left
outs, opportunistic product enhancements for companies like for – activities and divisions like HSA Bank. But
obviously, we look to, say a 45% to 65% payout ratio. We play a pretty robust dividend. And if we don't have line
of sight to organic investment, and we don't feel like there's a recessionary environment right in front of us, so we
feel pretty confident. We'll certainly use some of that authorization to buy back shares over the course of the next
three to four quarters.

Okay. Very good. And just last one for me, Glenn, slide 26, the asset sensitivity slide. You guys point out a 20%
beta over the first 12 months of the forecast. Does that hold for 100 bps of hikes and 200 bps?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President-Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
So, we have we have increased that, if you recall, for the last call, we were sort of in the 11% range. I think that's
something that we have to look at, and we're using 2021 right now. I think we do have a ramp up toward the end
part of the year. The wildcard here, Casey, is if that goes 50% and 50%, I think it may spike up. But what we're
using in our model right now on a full year basis, 12-month ramp up basis is like 21%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
Yeah. That's a great question. I think the immediate ones I've already referenced, which is a larger balance sheet
to be able to have more profitable and larger relationships with our existing commercial clients, potentially more
capital market fees depending on market conditions, so that scale of balance sheet and our existing penetration in
key commercial categories is kind of the immediate revenue synergy. There's obviously more cross-sell
opportunities. For example, our private bank legacy, Webster Private Bank is selling into the commercial portfolio
at Legacy Sterling, is an immediate opportunity to get more penetration in wealth management as we have
broader products and services to sell into and to deliver to our clients across a bigger footprint.
On the one hand side, there's a lot of exciting things because we're working through our Innovations group to
think about ways we can digitally serve 3 million retail clients at HSA Bank and digitize other products. So, we feel
that we're spending a lot of time on our longer term strategies around are there opportunities to digitize and sell
cards or short-term loan products into HSAs? Can we use our bigger balance sheet and larger corporate
relationships to leverage more sales of HSA of our standard and basic HSA products into a larger corporate client
base at Webster?
So, I think immediately what you'll see is in our core commercial relationships, broader, deeper, more profitable
relationships and over the long-term, our ability to create more cross-selling products across the bank and HSA
through innovation and digital products.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alex Yao Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities (Asia Pacific) Ltd.
Thanks, John. And one question on the HSA business. So, coming out of the pandemic, can you talk about the
HSA business and if you're seeing some return to normal for that business such as for balanced growth and fee
income? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Another great question, Alex. And we have not back to pre-pandemic levels, but there was muted activity.
You probably heard us over the last several calls talk about one of the dynamics was that most of the deposit
growth and account growth came actually from existing clients, so further penetration into existing clients. That
sort of waned a little bit as general activity slowed during the pandemic. As you heard me mention in my script, we
had 288,000 new accounts and obviously, net account growth reported was a little bit muted by the TPA account
still running off, but that was an increase over last year's account growth. And so that was healthy, almost a half a
billion in new core deposits which was also a positive trend line.
And what we did see underlying that was more of our existing clients were signing up new employees to high
deductible health plans and HSA accounts. So, I'd say that's trending in the right direction towards pre-pandemic
levels. And I think we saw the same thing as well in our card swipes and activity just from discretionary healthcare
activities and the like. So definitely, encouraging, not yet back to where we like it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President-Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. Let me just add a little bit color. On a debit transactions as an example, I think we did $6.9 million in the
quarter. That's versus $6.4 million, so that's the transaction volume is up year-over-year, 8.2% – a little over 8%.
So we are seeing some of that on a light quarter basis prior year.

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning. Good morning, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Good morning, Brock.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Just to follow up on the HSA questions. I noticed the on-balance sheet deposits, your off-balance
sheet funds are growing significantly faster. Is that the kind of mix we should expect going forward and can you
compare the economics of the two?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. We're happy to. We talk about this a good amount. So, the answer is, the trend line, obviously well, overall
penetration in the investment category is still relatively low. It's increasing, but relatively low. Obviously, the larger
balance accounts are the ones that transition into investments. And obviously, when you look at that number,
there's also the benefit or detriment of market performance that moves that around. And so, obviously, over the
course of last year, there was significant expansion in the value of those investments as well as more people
going into those investments.
It's no secret, and we're very transparent about the fact that for us, and I would say particularly in rising interest
rate environment, the deposits are more valuable to us, because we get the full benefit of the value of those
deposits to deploy directly into loan and asset growth. And with respect to the investments through both our
proprietary offering and [indiscernible] (00:34:54) and our vendor, we only get really 12b-1 fees from that. So,
we're talking you know somewhere between 10 basis points and 30 basis points depending on which avenue that
runs and so it is less profitable on its face.
However, what we've always said is, the investors in our HSA client base tend to have high average deposit
balances as well and tend to be among our stickiest depositors. So, we obviously want to provide our clients with
as much flexibility as we can there. And so, I think at the end of the day, there's a nice, virtuous cycle that allows
us to keep deposit growth running, albeit $1 for $1 it's not as profitable.

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And as a follow up, can you give us sort of a level set range now assuming relative stability, not a
recession ahead, in terms of net charge-off range for the combined company going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's a tough one. I've been surprised, as you know, as a former credit guy about the way credit has
performed even leading up into the pandemic period. I would say, we were experiencing that kind of 20-basis-
point, give or take, annualized net charge-offs before the pandemic. I think that if you think about commercial
categories, if there ever is kind of a return to normal, maybe think about that 20 basis point to 30 basis point
annualized charge-off rate as more of a normalized commercial charge-off rate. And obviously, we still haven't
seen it. There's been a lot of stimulus and other reasons why. But that's probably in our minds where we think it
would normalize on a commercial basis.

Jared Shaw Q

Maybe starting with the NII guide, does that assume sort of a stable mix of loans and securities in cash from
where we are right now or is that loan growth acceleration we assume that a lot of that is funded or some of that's
funded out of cash and securities?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President-Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, it assumes somewhere between 8% to 10% of loan growth. So, you could say 9% right in the middle. It
does assume that some of our securities portfolio will help fund that. But I think all in that's where we are. So,
there's some borrowings as well that you would expect to see. We have drawn down our cash levels, as you
know, for the last couple of quarters. So, our securities portfolio is about $15 billion. So, as we now reach the

Glenn I. MacInnes A

So, the impact of the securities, if that's what you're looking for, the impact of the valuation of securities after tax,
$240 million. And so, that impacted – we started out I mentioned the tangible common equity ratio of 8.26%, really
strong. That includes that 40 basis point reduction from the unrealized loss on the AFS portfolio.

So, it was about $15 million in accretion impact, as I think as I mentioned in my comments. I'm sure that we had

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's good. Thanks. And then just finally for me sort of following up on Brock's question about the charge-
offs, what's the expectation for the ratio of the allowance for credit loss as we move forward? Is there still a larger
qualitative reserve tied into that or are we sort of good with that...

...in the current year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President-Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
I guess, we're 1.31% coverage and I think we're expecting like a stable ACL ratio and we'll continue to monitor
credit quality, macro loan mix, loan growth as well. I think John hit on it in some of his comments that there is a
qualitative portion and we're being somewhat conservative on that until we see how things play out over the next
couple of quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think that's spot on. I think. We feel really good about the reserve, as Glenn said. Another way to say, we
think it's relatively conservative. I think there is enough choppiness going forward that it's the right reserve level
now. But if we do see some of the uncertainty going forward, the war or some of the other choppiness kind of
settle down, we do think there may be an opportunity to lower that reserve a bit.

Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned at the outset about the economy contracting and a question I
always seem to get whenever recession enters the narrative related to Webster is, your leveraged loan exposure.
Could you talk about what the exposure is there and any details you can provide to giving investors comfort
related to historical loss rates, leverage multiples, equity contribution by private equity sponsors to provide
cushion for you guys? Can you rattle off some stats there?

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
David, you love to ask me that question, I could stay here for the next hour and talk about it, but I promise I won't.
And I weaved in that contraction in the GDP from one of my colleagues here last minute, because it wasn't in my
script, but I don't want to seem like we were blind through what was going on. Hey, one of the other reasons we
talked about, another benefit of doing this transaction and having a bigger balance sheet is that, again, from a
concentration perspective, it gives Sponsor & Specialty more running room under a prudent portfolio approach to
management to the way we manage it.
So, I will tell you that as of quarter end, our kind of regulatory defined definition of leveraged loans was a roughly
6% of the entire loan portfolio of the organization with like credit performance to the rest of the portfolio, as we've
said before. That's kind of held historically through both the great financial crisis, through the pandemic in that
while there may be volatility in risk rating at times, it performs at or better than the rest of the portfolio, and it goes
to some of the things you're talking about.
We feel like we're not involved in – kind of not that much involved in market level, large syndicated deals. We
have a lot of really good long-term relationships with private equity sponsors. We tend to play in areas that have
repeatable, protectable, predictable cash flows, like our technology group, like our data center and infrastructure
group, like our healthcare and healthcare services group, so they tend to be companies that during normal cycles
actually have predictable cash flow, and obviously during the pandemic, those did well.
We don't do a lot of covenant life like transactions. And you are right to say that one of the benefits are in these
deals is there is a lot of cash and equity underneath your senior debt. So, it takes a real paradigm shift in any
company's performance to have that private equity firms say, hey, we're out of here or we want to give you the
keys. And so, we've tend to work with these private equity firms for literally more than 20 years in some cases,
and have a really good relationship where the senior debt and the equity work to get a great outcomes. And so, it
is enterprise reliant. It doesn't have hard collateral underneath it. And I think that's why sometimes the markets
always ask the question. But I think we've had a long and durable time to kind of validate our strategies and
underwriting in that area. And again, it's 6% of a $44 billion loan portfolio. So, it's also right-sized, I believe, where
we are.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Very helpful. Thank you. And then shifting over to, you guys spoke about the USDF consortium. I was curious can
you talk to the opportunity there, particularly on that deposit front?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. Let me take a step back. So, we're excited about this Innovations Group. We have a great leader there in
Bea Ordonez, the former CFO of Sterling and the group, we're looking at a number of things there in terms of
banking as a service, including the direct bank activities and this consortium around distributed ledger and
blockchain. The reality is, from an analyst perspective, it's not a significant drag on expenses, and we don't really
have any built-in revenue in the short-term.
What our goal is ultimately is, I guess twofold, which is to help to augment our existing businesses through digital
strategies and the like, obviously, to look to continue to digitize consumer and retail banking, try and discover an
effective and efficient way to get to new profit pools. And then, for example, on the consortium and distributed

ledger, applying through a lot of use cases, so you could think of end-to-end process in correspondent mortgage,
or you can think of trading and storing loans on chain, you could think of 24-hour cheap, effective, and efficient
payment strategies.
As it relates specifically to the consortium, there's going to be a little bit of a slow walk as we work with the other
banks, as we work with the technology providers, and we work with the regulators, quite frankly, on kind of
moving forward. So, it's all of those use cases I just mentioned, but the expectations are that we won't see
immediate direct benefit just because of kind of the nature of the development of the technology, the figuring out
all the risk aspects and also working through the regulatory landscape.
So, a lot of exciting things that we think will benefit us 2023 and beyond. But from a 2022 perspective, it's not
factored into our financial statements.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
Mattew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Great. Okay. And then, what are the blended new loan yields you're putting on the books today, commercial real
estate, traditional C&I? And then oppositely, have you started to feel any pressure even exception base pricing on
the deposit front at all?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
So, on the deposits, not really. Maybe a few select circumstances on the government side, but otherwise, no.
That's easy. I'll take that the second question first. And then the first question is on rates and spreads. And it's
always been for, I think, both legacy organization. We try and remain pretty disciplined, but there is some
variability as you go through the different asset classes. So, I would say, I'm looking at commercial real estate,
high quality institutional commercial real estate being done [ph] L+175 to L+3 (00:48:25) in the range.
Obviously on Sponsor & Specialty, we talked about you're getting much higher yields on some of those leveraged
loans. So, when we talk about originations in any one given quarter, it's usually based upon kind of what the mix
is in that quarter. Obviously it's very competitive out there, but we've not seen dramatic rate compression. We saw
some before the pandemic, it kind of evened out, and while it is very competitive we're still able to meet our return
on capital hurdles on these loans. And it really is just a question of in which loan category in which business we're
booking them. And obviously, the ones that have lower yields are the ones that have better risk ratings and so the
capital allocation is lower.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mattew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And then the last one from me is just more out of curiosity. You said you were going to reduce
corporate square footage by 40%, 45%. Is that predominantly the double headquarter or Sterling's legacy
headquarters or could you just frame for us what the corporate square footage is and how much in the way of cost
savings is from that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think it's around $5 million on an annualized basis. And it really is not related to either exiting markets or
changing headquarters. We're actually – we have more people in our Waterbury headquarters than we did before
we moved our official headquarters. And we're kind of rejiggering where everybody is. We have multiple locations
in New York that we'll consolidate in terms of the overlap between the two banks and that is really just reduction in
square footage in a lot of our markets in terms of taking less space in an existing building or moving to a more
efficient building because of the future of work, because we have a hybrid model going forward, and because
we're using kind of a campus model where people are going into different offices.
And a lot of our call center activities, Matt, we're in the process – one of the things we're trying to do from an
efficiency perspective, we have basically working through an HSA Bank call center, a legacy Sterling call center,
and a legacy Webster call center. And even before the merger, all of those call centers have started to move
significantly remote, which is an industry trend. So, we're also able to reduce sort of big footprint office space
housing call centers over time.

8.26%. For every 100 basis point immediate shock to the curve, 100 basis point, you can expect – it would
probably impact the tangible common equity ratio by 40 basis points. So, if you put that in perspective, you got

300 basis point rate shock, 300 basis point shock. You would still be above 7% on your tangible common equity
ratio. So, I think understand the concerns and I understand the talk about it, but we're not as concerned about it,
to be honest with you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
And from the economic perspective, obviously, that rate increase would, on the revenue side, would help us
significantly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President-Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Exactly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Right. No. I hear you. I hear you. Your deposits, obviously, just became more valuable. It's only marking one tiny
piece, but, obviously, we follow it because we look at tangible books. Just wanted to get clarity on that. On net
interest margin, net interest income, and I appreciate all the slides and the clarity you've given, I just want to make
sure that I have got this right. So, your guide on accretion income for the full year is $73.5 million, of which $36
million was in the first quarter, dropping to $18.3 million in the second quarter. Did I hear that right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
You did.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President-Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
And I will just add...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President-Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
...this is spread out based on schedules, based on contractual, the loan, if there's pre-payments and stuff like that.
So, there'll be lumpiness in this. You can expect that. That's for sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah, absolutely. I appreciate the guide. Okay. So, just putting that together. So, again, it was 29 basis points on
your headline margin this quarter...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah.

No. That reconciled.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
And then just extrapolating then your $9 million to $10 million – you're falling to $9 million to $10 million or so per
quarter by the third and fourth quarter. So, then that's going to be a 6 basis point or so...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

5 basis point – okay. Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President-Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
I think by the fourth quarter, so let me just – I think by the fourth quarter, my calculation is it's probably about 12
basis points in accretion, somewhere between 10 basis points and 12 basis points.

Somewhere between – okay. That's super helpful. Okay. And then, PPP fees, what was that this quarter in terms
of dollar amount of net interest income?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President-Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
So, it was $5.1 million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. And do you know how much you've got remaining of...?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President-Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
I think it's $84 million left in balances, which will run off probably just even in the second quarter. So, we should be
through it all by then.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. So, you probably have just about $1 million or $2 million left of PPP fees, is that enough?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President-Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's very small. Very small.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Great. Great. Okay. And then, on fee income, can you talk to us a little bit about, well, just two questions. First,
just specifically on BOLI, I was looking at that. I know Sterling's got a higher BOLI than you. Was there some sort
of drop pro forma or there's some sort of mark or anything like that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President-Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
No. No. No. There's no mark there. If you're looking, you should not see a change. I mean, there's no adjustment
there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. Okay. Okay. Great. And then on fee income, could you just comment a little bit about NSF/OD fees how
much that was in the quarter? How you're approaching a more customer-friendly change to that. When we could
see timing? And when we could see that maybe impact the non-interest income line?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A
Executive Vice President-Chief Financial Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Sure. I mean, like the rest of the industry, obviously, we're working as we combine the two banks and integration
on harmonizing the product set. So, we're actually working on creating a product that's obviously consumer-
friendly and meets consumer needs and is consistent with everyone else in the industry. I would say, it will not

have an impact in 2022. The other important thing to recognize is that our total aggregate OD fees are less than
1% of revenue. So, less than $20 million across the two organizations and so, I think you'll see that go down over
time as we roll out new products. But it won't have a material impact on our financial performance. And it won't
have really any impact on our financial performance in 2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
I mean, let me just double back on some – because I may have misunderstood your question on volume. When
you're looking at the income statement from our press release, because that would only have two months of
Sterling in it and that could...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
So, that's probably [indiscernible] (00:56:51) Okay. I thought you were looking at the balance sheet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
No. I was looking at the income statement – you know what, maybe I grabbed the Sterling number wrong. I'll go
back and look at that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
So, there's no change to that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
And then on the OD/NSF piece I just want to make sure I heard that right. So, that's running on a combined basis
for both of you at about $20 million annually, is that right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn I. MacInnes A

Yeah. In aggregate.

Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
In aggregate. Okay. Perfect. Great. And then just one last question for me. This is small, obviously, your credit is
looking so great. Your gross commercial charge offs – gross, not net of $11.2 million was such a jump from last
quarter and from what it's been running, last quarter was $800,000. Was most of that Sterling or was some of that
vintage Webster? Anything one specific, any color around that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah, Laurie. I don't talk specifically about that. It was one credit. Yeah. I will say, it was legacy Webster and it
was one commercial credit that made up the vast majority of that charge with no...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. Great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
...yeah, there's no other interesting aspects or correlation in it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Laurie Havener Hunsicker Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. Great. And then just – sorry, one last question here. With respect to Sterling's multifamily book, can you
just give us a little bit of color around that, a little refresh? It gets around $4 billion. Anything you've got on LTVs, if
you could remind us what's rent controlled, what your plans are, just any color around that would be helpful.
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Thank you, Laurie. It's about $3.9 billion. It has a weighted average LTV at origination of 54% and the debt
service coverage ratio on average is about 1.56% performing very well and generating economic profit. So, I don't
think there are any strategic changes. Obviously, we actually have a nice business there and we'll continue to
originate where we're opportunistic. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Do you have how much is rent control there?

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
I only have a couple of questions. The growth rate you're talking about, John, the 8% to 10%. How much of that
do you think is environmental versus the long-term potential of the company over the next couple of years? I
guess my question is, can we see this kind of growth rate for a couple of years from the company?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
That's a great question. And I'm not – look, it may be simplistic because for those of you who've followed us. I
kind of fundamentally believe that we've got enough levers, enough geographic opportunities, a bunch of
interesting business niches and verticals that historically, we've been able to grow commercial loans, which now
make up the predominant portion of the balance sheet at roughly 10% CAGR. And it's been about six or seven
years.
Obviously, in any one given quarter, you saw mortgage warehouse have an impact on the annualized growth rate
in the first quarter. That could change, but particularly this quarter on a bigger base this year, we felt like all of
those things remain true, although the levers we can pull without having a push on risk. And we have the benefit,
as I mentioned in my script in earlier, the bigger balance sheet to at least in the short-term, kind of accelerate
some growth through single point exposures.

Going forward, obviously, as the balance sheet gets bigger, market conditions dictate, it may get more
challenging. But I still think and my Head of Commercial Banking is here, Chris Motl, right now, and he'd probably
smile, is that we try and say to ourselves how are we going to get close to double digits, high single digits loan
growth on an annualized basis. So, my guess is, with what we have, with the teams we think we can attract, with
the various businesses we have that in my mind, at least, as the leader of the company, we're kind of targeting
10% commercial loan growth.
Now, sometimes, on mortgage and some of the other consumer categories which are less, that's not a realistic
expectation, because the market just won't allow, which could drag down overall loan growth. But I still think 8% to
10% should be our bogey in a normalized economic environment as we move forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Good. And then last one, it's a real question, kind of a soft question, but maybe a good way to end the call.
But you talked about the culture-shaping offsite and I'm just curious what you've learned from that, what do you
guys need to work on and that's serious, what do you need to work on, and then, what's gone well, so far, from
those activities? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John R. Ciulla A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Webster Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's a great question. I think it's the hardest thing. And I couldn't be more pleased and I say that I would be
more guarded if I wasn't. I mentioned on a couple of non-deal roadshows, you're in a situation where it sucked, I
know that technical term, it sucks to have to wait for four months from our originally anticipated close date. But I
think if you ask any of the executives or level two or level three folks across the organization what the silver lining
was, it was the fact that we had four more months to work together in terms of planning and meeting and figuring
out each other and building trust.
And so, I think that actually helped. We hit the ground running, I've been really pleased. There's no question
about the fact that it'll take time to make sure that you get rid of the us versus them or people are still referring to
things like legacy Webster and legacy Sterling. But I have to tell you that we've really coalesced around what it
means to be a Webster banker about the behaviors we expect. When we went in – and I don't want to get too
granular, when we went into the sort of culture practice as a leadership team, we realized that while we believe
that all of these values were what we wanted to do, we had different definitions of what those behaviors were,
different expectations, and so we spent a lot of time saying, we really need to be careful about making sure we're
all on the same page, we all understand what we're trying to accomplish. We all understand the bank's mission
and purpose and we've come together really, really solidly.
Half my direct reports are from each of the legacy banks, and I think we're operating as well as, either bank was
operating before from a trust and collaborative perspective. So, we'll keep working it, reinforcing it. But I couldn't
be more pleased with where we are 90 days into this project.
