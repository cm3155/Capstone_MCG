William Henry Rogers
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Well, thanks, Ankur. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. I hope everyone is well and safe.
I'm very pleased by Truist's continued progress and our solid third quarter performance. Our quarterly results
reflect the diversity of our business mix, which drove strong fee income and help overcome continued softness in
net interest income. Credit quality was outstanding resulting in another provision benefit. Loan growth was
modest; excluding PPP, generally in line with our expectations. We also achieved a major integration milestone
this past weekend, and we'll share more details on these topics during the presentation of.
So, if I move you to slide 4, I'd like to begin with our purpose, which is to inspire and build better lives and
communities. We believe our purpose-driven culture is the primary factor behind our success as a company. Our
purpose defines how we do business every day and it serves as a framework for how we make decisions. A
recent example of this was our decision to remain open during our conversion last Saturday, so we could care for
our clients and address any questions. To my knowledge, that's a first for a major systems conversion such as
ours.
I've said in our culture, purpose, performance, teamwork, and a client-first mindset all coexist, and there's no
better evidence of that than the extraordinary success our teammates delivered this past weekend in our most
significant merger milestone to-date, details of which I'll cover shortly.
Slide 5 describes how we're living out our purpose and highlights some of the notable progress we've made
during the quarter. During the pandemic, philanthropic giving was a natural way to put our purpose into action due
to the effects of the coronavirus on our clients, teammates, and communities. The purpose is much broader than
philanthropy. We developed this slide around major themes contained in our CSR and ESG report because
they're the topics that are most important to all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders.
I won't cover every point on the slide, let me just highlight a few. We continue to make strong progress against our
$60 billion Community Benefits Plan currently at 112% of target, including the ongoing impact that Truist
Community Capital provides our communities with regards to affordable housing, access to healthy food and
education, and investments in job creation and small business. Truist and EVERFI announced that all elementary
school students nationwide will soon have access to WORDForce Universe, a digital early literacy program. I'll
talk more about this shortly.
But we've migrated 7 million clients to the new Truist digital banking experience, which includes enhanced digital
investment and money-management capabilities, personalized insights, and a holistic personal financial
management tool. We committed to increase diversity in our senior leadership roles to at least 15% by 2023.
We're currently at almost 14% and clearly on track.
Importantly, long-term, the way we create a more diverse senior leadership organization is by recruiting diverse
early talent and then developing, retaining, and promoting over time. And for early career program hiring in 2021,
64% of the seats at Truist were filled by diverse candidates. All of this progress, combined with enhanced

disclosures, has resulted in solid improvements in our ESG scores. Lastly, in a few weeks, we'll release our
inaugural Truist TCFD report. Our teammates and I are very proud of Truist in all the ways we deliver on our
purpose.
So, turning to the third quarter performance highlights on slide 7. We earned $1.6 billion or $1.20 earnings per
share for the quarter on a reported basis. On an adjusted basis, we are at $1.9 billion or $1.42 per share.
Adjusted EPS increased 46% versus the same quarter last year and is largely driven by the provision benefit.
Sequentially, EPS declined 8% as we had a greater benefit from the provision last quarter and seasonally
stronger revenues last quarter.
We had strong returns, including the 22.6% adjusted ROTCE. Excluding the reserve release, adjusted ROTCE
was still very good, north of 19%. Revenues totaled $5.6 billion, fairly stable compared to last quarter. On an
adjusted basis, year-over-year revenue growth was 2% as much stronger fee income offsets an almost 30-basis-
point decline in margin and an 8% decline in loans, a reflection of this unique environment that we're all in.
The stronger adjusted fee income, which grew 12% compared to a year ago, did drive slightly higher expenses
than expected, but our PPNR is broadly in line with our expectations. Asset quality continues to be an excellent
story as we outperformed our net charge-off guidance with lower charge-offs across C&I combined with strong
recoveries.
During the quarter, we were pleased to increase the dividends 7%, and we completed the Constellation
acquisition, which had a very good first quarter with Truist Insurance. Also, we announced the strategic
acquisition of Service Finance, which will close later this year. Daryl will share some additional information on
Service Finance, but it's broadly a reflection of Truist skating to where the puck is going and partnering with a
leader in home improvement point-of-sale lending. We also completed our retail mortgage origination
conversions and benefits, which Daryl will also highlight later.
Last but certainly not least, I'm very excited to report this past weekend we completed a major phase of our core
bank conversion. After a lot of intense, deliberate, thoughtful, and purposeful preparation by our team, we were
able to stand up the Truist technology ecosystem and migrate all heritage BB&T retail, wealth, and business
clients to it. The event went extremely well and there are a number of notable positive impacts for clients and
teammates. Starting this past Tuesday, over 2,500 heritage BB&T teammates were able to log on to the new
Truist commercial lending ecosystem for the first time. Because of the conversion, the sales force client
management and sales pipeline system is now directly connected to the nCino lending origination system, which
allows for better communication and workflow across the deal team and visibility on progress of the loan all in one
place. These upgrades also lay the foundation for future digital innovation.
We're now able to offer Truist products to new clients and the heritage BB&T clients through our branches and
digitally through truist.com, including our new Truist Ready Now loan, a small dollar lending solution for existing
clients to cover emergency financing needs between $100 and $1,000 consistent with our belief on the
importance of emergency savings. We upgraded our ATM contact center and digital payment capabilities across
a number of dimensions, including more client self-service, improved authentication, and operational
simplification. While this was not a physical branding event, the conversion places us on excellent footing for the
final conversion in the first quarter of 2022 when heritage SunTrust clients will transition to the Truist ecosystem
and all branches will become Truist.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2021
Again, I want to congratulate our teammates on a job well done. They prepared with intensity and purpose for
multiple quarters. They learned and applied lessons from previous conversion work. They worked nonstop this
past weekend and delivered a seamless conversion. I really could not be more proud.
Now, let's go into slide 8. We have three significant items that negatively affected earnings during the quarter.
First, merger charges totaled $132 million after tax, lower than last quarter, because higher voluntary separation
retirement program costs were reflected in the second quarter. This VSRP program is one of the many
components of our overall cost-saving goal. Approximately half of our 2,000 teammates who elected to participate
left on September 30. And I cannot thank them enough for their long-standing efforts to build the foundation of
Truist by helping create two amazing companies, in BB&T and SunTrust, and then helping bring Truist to life
during our almost first two years of existence.
Incremental operating expenses related to the merger were $147 million after tax. As a reminder, these are
merger-related expenses, but don't meet the technical definition of a merger-related and restructuring charges
and will not be part of our run rate in 2023 and beyond.
Also, we had a onetime professional fee accrual that met our disclosure and adjustment threshold totaling $23
million after tax. This fee was incurred to develop an ongoing program to identify, prioritize, and road map
teammate-generated revenue growth and expense-saving opportunities as part of the merger and beyond. This
helps ensure that we'll achieve our 2022 cost-saving targets. It's also fuel for creating more capacity for
investments in the future, will also improve the client experience, simplify our processes, and create a more
engaged and energized workforce.
Our teammates generated more than 5,000 initial ideas, which we consolidated and narrowed down to
approximately 1,000, and we're building the execution plan. Ultimately, our goal is for this to be an ongoing way of
how we do business at Truist, empowering our teammates to identify and execute on ideas to improve our
company. The total impact on these three items was $0.22 per share (sic) [$0.23 per share].
Turning to slide 9, as we've noted, Truist is the first large merger in the digital age. So, we're highly focused on
ensuring a smooth transition for our digitally active clients. Our new Truist digital experience reflects two of our
core digital and technology principles; cocreation with our clients, and failing fast to learn fast. We built this new
platform based directly on clients' feedback, and we're introducing it in waves, learning from each release, and
getting better every time. We made great progress in the third quarter inviting approximately 7 million retail,
wealth, and small business clients to migrate to the Truist digital experience through September. About half of
those clients have started and used the platform in lieu of their heritage app. By the end of this quarter, our goal is
to migrate all digital clients to the Truist digital platforms.
We've received ongoing feedback from our clients and incorporated opportunities for improvement iteratively over
the course of the migration, which has resulted in improved client experience over time. This de-risked our core
bank conversion and makes Truist the first to de-link the frontend conversion from the backend, a patented
approach we can leverage for future backend innovation.
As you can see on slide 10, we continue to experience healthy demand for digital banking services as our clients
look for more convenient and effective ways to transact and manage their finances. The pace of digital adoption
has been especially rapid in mobile. Active mobile users and Zelle transactions are up 11% and 58%,
respectively, year-over-year.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2021
Last quarter I highlighted that we are creating a common core digital architecture and platform for retail, wealth,
and small business clients, which creates agility and seamless client experiences, yet ones that are tailored and
designed for the unique needs of each client segment. For our wealth clients, we provide a differentiated digital
client experience that reflects their relationship with Truist. An integrated platform will provide a one-stop shop for
their holistic financial picture, including a unified investment portfolio experience that is agnostic to whether the
account is a trust or brokerage account, holistic financial planning with external account aggregation, and the
ability to secure, store, and exchange documents with their advisor, and the same access to low-cost digital and
automated investing that we now offer retail clients.
Turning to slide 11, on an absolute basis, loans declined $2.4 billion sequentially. However, if you exclude the
impact of PPP forgiveness, average loans increased $1.6 billion or 2.3% annualized, consistent with our outlook.
When you peel back the onion, there are some good trends but we also have headwinds. PPP declined $4 billion
on average in the quarter and dealer floor plan declined an additional billion. We expect PPP to decline an
additional $2 billion or so on average in the fourth quarter. Dealer utilization is about 25% well below historical
averages.
We've been somewhat cautious in CRE, although we're beginning to see opportunities in that space that meet our
risk appetite and portfolio diversity objectives. Even so, that portfolio declined $1.2 billion sequentially. Excluding
these items, commercial loans increased $1.1 billion or 0.9% sequentially.
So, we're seeing some improved momentum. More banking regions are experiencing core C&I growth, pipelines
in the commercial community bank and CRE businesses continue to grow, and our revolver exposure also grew
2% sequentially, evidence of our relevance that our clients are building capacity for investments and expansion.
Big picture, our corporate and commercial clients remain optimistic, but labor shortages and supply chain issues
are affecting their businesses no different than Truist. Net-net, we believe there is meaningful upside to the C&I
growth story as the economy continues to improve, pandemic-related disruptions subside, and the liquidity-related
distortions from ongoing government stimulus abate, but the timing of all this is difficult to predict.
On the consumer slide, mortgage has shifted from a shrinking to a growing portfolio, reflecting increased
operational capacity, slower prepaid speeds, and our tactical decision to balance sheet correspondent production.
We're also seeing good performance with indirect auto, LightStream, Sheffield, and credit card, all of which are
growing versus last quarter.
So, turning to slide 12, we added this slide this quarter to provide a little more color on growth and headwinds for
average loans into several significant moving pieces. Long-term, loan growth is an output and a highly correlated
economic growth, which we believe is on firm footing, particularly in our markets. We also continue to pursue
tactics and strategies to capture more than our fair share of loan growth within our risk appetite and diversification
objectives, including deepening our lending relationships with our wealth clients, increasing our digital and point-
of-sale lending capabilities, and expanding our wallet share within certain corporate and commercial clients.
Turning to slide 13, average deposits increased $6.5 billion or 1.6% compared to the second quarter, largely due
to the continuing effects of recent government stimulus. More importantly, Truist continues to resonate with
clients. We continue to make solid progress with quality account growth. Year-to-date, our net new personal DDA
accounts grew almost 50,000, significantly higher than last year. Net new business DDA is up 11% year-over-
year. In addition, client attrition from closed branches continues to be very low. This performance reflects
excellent execution by our retail community bank teammates.
And with that, let me turn it over to Daryl to review our financial performance in greater detail.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2021
Daryl N. Bible
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone.
Turning to slide 14, net interest income was down slightly versus prior quarter. This was consistent with our
guidance and reflected two competing factors. Purchase accounting accretion decreased $53 million linked
quarter and contributed 23 basis points to reported margin, down from 28 basis points in the second quarter.
However, core net interest income increased $41 million. This was driven by a larger investment portfolio, which
resulted in strong deposit growth that more than offset lower PPP revenue. Core net interest margin decreased 2
basis points due to higher liquidity and lower PPP revenue. We expect to earn an additional $125 million in PPP
revenues over the coming three quarters and for the balance to be de minimis by mid-2022.
We continue to be asset-sensitive. We estimate that a 100-basis-point ramp increase would increase NII by 4.1%.
A 100-basis-points shock would increase NII by 7.9%. We are also well-positioned to benefit from rising rates at
both the short and long end of the curve. Two-thirds of our reported asset sensitivity is from the short end and it
assumes deposit beta of approximately 50%. In reality, we have experienced, over the last few years ago, deposit
betas are likely to be significantly lower than our modeled assumptions on the first few rate hikes. For every 10%
decline in deposit beta, our asset sensitivity increases by about 100 basis points.
Moving to slide 15, as Bill highlighted, we had a very strong quarter from a fee income perspective. Fee income,
excluding security gains from last year, was up a very strong 12% like quarter, exceeding our initial expectations.
Insurance income increased 25% in total. This was due to acquisitions and also a very strong 12% organic
growth.
Investment banking had a second best quarter and record M&A performance. M&A results like this do not come in
a vacuum. They are results of years of investment and commitment to our clients. Capital markets [indiscernible]
(00:19:54) revenue was up 22% year-to-date. Wealth remains very strong, up 10% compared to a year ago as a
result of market conditions but also positive asset flows. CRE-related income was down after its record second
quarter performance, but momentum continues to be positive.
Residential mortgage was down like quarter due to lower refinance activity. However, it increased $62 million
sequentially, primarily due to better servicing income, due to lower prepayment speeds, and the addition of a new
servicing portfolio. Production income also improved sequentially as we restored capacity after temporarily
reducing it last quarter. Other income of $131 million was also another high watermark largely due to valuation
gains related to our SBIC funds. Our non-qualified plan continues to have positive valuation adjustments, and we
have now included the details of both the non-qualified plan and CVA in our earnings release tables.
Turning to expenses on slide 16. Adjusted noninterest expense increased 2.4% sequentially compared to our
guidance of a relatively flat. Drivers included higher-than-anticipated fee income which pushed incentives above
our forecast in addition to a $32 million cost from a non-qualified plan. Excluding the effects of these items,
adjusted expenses were only slightly above our expectations. On an absolute basis, adjusted noninterest
expense increased primarily due to higher planned marketing costs as we continue to build our brand awareness
as well as higher technology costs which are reflected in software and equipment expense.
Moving to asset quality on slide 17. Asset quality remains excellent, reflecting our prudent risk culture, diversified
portfolio, favorable economic conditions, and the effects of stimulus. Our net charge-off ratio was 19 basis points,
a pro-forma post-financial-crisis low. Leading indications – indicators remain strong as NPLs and early-stage
delinquencies remain low. Our ALLL coverage ratio decreased to 1.65% as the economic scenarios continue to

improve and – but still remains above our CECL Day 1 level of 1.54%. We also had a provision benefit of $324
million.
Continuing on slide 18. Capital remains strong. Our CET1 ratio of 10.1% was above our near-term 9.75% target.
We did not repurchase any shares during the third quarter due to the effects of the recent acquisition activity. We
have approximately $1 billion to $2 billion of potential capital deployment remaining through the third quarter of
2022. We expect to consume approximately $500 million of this capacity via share repurchases in the fourth
quarter, reflecting our own capital position, reduced integration risk on the heels of very successful integration
event Bill discussed earlier.
Turning to slide 19. We provide additional details about Service Finance. We continue to be very excited about
Service Finance, and the acquisition is on track to close later this year. Service Finance is strategically attractive
because it expands the scale and capabilities of our existing point-of-sale businesses, which is where the
consumer preferences are shifting. In addition, we believe home improvement is in a secular growth phase, and
the professional financing market is highly fragmented. Service Finance is the perfect partner for Truist given its
proven track record of business development and growth, its exclusive focus on home improvement, strong digital
client experience, and an excellent reputation in the marketplace. From a financial perspective, we have provided
a few additional details to help you model the transaction. The vast majority of Service Finance revenue will come
in noninterest income. The NII is a mix of consumer interest income and discounts provided by the merchants.
Loan yields are in the high-single digits from a run-rate perspective, though initially they are somewhat lower due
to the impact of promotional periods on an unseasoned loan portfolio. We expect production to grow at a fast
pace over the coming years. We expect to allocate $1.1 billion to goodwill and $700 million to intangibles. We also
expect to capture approximately $250 million in value over time from a step-up in tax basis. On a stand-alone
basis, the acquisition is 4% GAAP-dilutive in year one. Half of this dilution is driven by the utilization of capital in
lieu of share repurchases. The other half is driven by the first-year GAAP net income contribution.
Earnings streams take time to build as we transition from an originate-to-sell to an originate-to-hold model. But
over the long term, it is extremely profitable and accretive to all of our KPIs. We did not model any future revenue
synergies, but see many opportunities for better leverage our combined capabilities and accelerate our revenue
and growth potential. We have terminated third-party partnerships with certain point-of-sale financing providers.
The impact of this is $2 billion of run-off will begin in early 2022.
Moving to the integration update on slide 21. As Bill highlighted, we achieved a major milestone this past
weekend with the successful migration of our heritage BB&T retail and commercial clients to the Truist
ecosystem. Another milestone in the quarter was completing the migration of our Truist retail mortgage origination
platform.
Turning to slide 22. We are committed to achieving $1.6 billion of net cost saves and continue to make progress
in each of the five categories. Third-party spend is down 11.2% from the baseline levels, exceeding our targeted
reduction of 10%. We closed 39 branches during the third quarter, bringing the cumulative closures to 413. We're
still on track to achieve approximately 800 total closures by the first quarter of 2022. We are also seven-eighths of
the way towards our non-branch facility reduction target which will likely have more reductions to come in 2022.
Average FTEs are down 11% since the merger excluding the acquisitions. We expect further declines in FTEs in
the coming quarters due to the VSRP program where the first-quarter wave of departures began on September
30. Technology saves will materialize after redundant systems are decommissioned in 2022. We have also noted
areas where we continue to make critical investments including digital, technology, talent, and acquisitions in
select business lines.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2021
Turning to slide 23. We still expect to incur a total merger cost of approximately $4 billion through 2022. We have
incurred cumulative merger costs of approximately $3 billion through the third quarter, reflecting the considerable
integration work on slide 21. We continue to expect these costs to decrease after the first quarter of final bank
conversion and then drop off entirely after 2022.
Continuing on slide 24. Core noninterest expense was just over $3 billion in the third quarter. As a reminder, this
calculation removes the effects of higher variable compensation due to fee income and corporate performance
since 2019, asset value changes in our retirement plan, and acquisition since the merger of equals. As a result,
core noninterest expense is more comparable to our baseline expenses at the time of the merger close. Based on
the trajectory of ongoing cost-save initiatives, we are on track to achieve the fourth-quarter core expense target.
I will now provide guidance for the fourth quarter. Reported net interest margin is expected to decrease 5 to 7
basis points with half attributable to lower purchase accounting accretion, and the other half due to increased
liquidity and less PPP revenue. We expect reported net interest income to decline 1% sequentially entirely due to
lower purchase accounting accretion. Core net interest income is expected to be stable. Fee income, excluding
the non-qualified plan, is expected to be largely stable from the third quarter as strength of insurance, investment
banking, wealth, and CRE is offset by lower mortgage revenue and lower SBIC valuation gains.
Adjusted noninterest expense is expected to decrease 3% to 4% from the third quarter. The primary drivers are
personnel expense driven primarily by VSRP; occupancy expense; and technology costs such as software and
equipment expense. For those that leverage our core expense target for the fourth quarter to build the adjusted
expenses, you must add back the impact of acquisitions and higher levels of incentive compensation expense
from the higher fees and performance relative to 2019. We expect net charge-off ratio to be 20 to 30 basis points
given favorable economic conditions, although we expect some normalization of these levels over time. Finally,
we expect further reductions in the ALLL ratio assuming economic conditions remain healthy. Given all this, Truist
should have positive operating leverage next quarter when compared to the third.
Now, I'll turn it back to Bill to conclude.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Thanks, Daryl. Slide 25 provides an overview of our value proposition. Maybe the details, obviously, we've shared
in the past.
Now, flipping to slide 26, that provides some performance highlights that support our value proposition with actual
performance this quarter. Our markets continue to have strong in-migration, the data of which can lag. Fee
income from insurance, investment banking, and wealth was up 20% year-over-year and up approximately $1
billion compared to 2019. Our third-quarter results clearly reflect the potential for profitability levels to be industry-
leading as we come out of the merger.
Lastly, we continue to deploy more capital on behalf of our clients and shareholders, and we'll have that capacity
to do more over time as integration risks subside, and the economy stays on sound footing. So, in conclusion, the
effects of the pandemic are moderating. The economy is getting better. We are one major step away from
completing our integration process and are beginning to shift from a more defensive to a more offensive position
and from a merger focus to a performance focus. We fully believe that Truist's best days are ahead.
So, with that, Ankur, I'm going to turn it back over to you and Q&A.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. Thanks. I had a first question just around the Service Finance acquisition, and I just wanted to
understand how you're thinking about leveraging this acquisition from here, both on the merchant side as well as
on the customer side talking about opportunities for expansion integration into your platform and then on the
customer side cross-sell?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, Betsy, it's a great question. As Daryl mentioned, we sort of didn't model any of that into the basic models. I
mean the basic model you saw is sort of a Service Finance as a stand-alone. One of the really attractive parts of
this integration for Truist, it was the fact that they've developed relationships with 14,000 contractors, 180
manufacturers. Just sort of think about that in context – or 80 manufacturers; think about that in context. Many of
those which are existing clients of Truist. So, we've got this incredible opportunity to expand those relationships.
They are adding a lot of new clients to our base who are single-product clients who we've got an opportunity to
expand using things like LightStream and the capabilities that we have. They're using our – the prowess of our
CIB bankers with the manufacturers, helping expand with the contractors.
There's a whole nother component to Service Finance, which is really interesting. It's the whole ESG piece of
what they're doing to create sort of more energy efficiency. And the concept of just everything related to home
improvement. I mean what we really like about Service Finance, it's a pure play on the home side. So, if you think

about all the things that we have related to home, so think about insurance that we have related to home, think
about home equity, think about mortgage, think about all the prowess and product and capabilities we have
related to home. We're just starting to explore those kind of opportunities. So, this is why we feel so good about
this. I mean this suggests to us where the bucks go in, as I said, versus where it is. And to your question, I think
those are significant opportunities ahead of us.

Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
The only thing I would add to that, Betsy, is that the returns on this, it will be eventually over a 3% ROA business,
and our risk-adjusted yield will be really attractive.

William Henry Rogers A

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
So, follow-up question here, Daryl, on the rate sensitivity. You did give us the first 100 basis points, and I know
the question is going to be what about that second 100 basis points. So, the first 100 basis points is a really low
deposit beta, 15% historically, I think you mentioned. Can you remind us what the deposit beta was like on that
second 100 basis points? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
If you go back to the last rate cycle that we went to, it was basically when rates bottomed out, the Fed moved up 6
times 150 basis points. If you look at the deposit betas, the first probably two or three deposit betas were probably
about plus or minus 20%. And then, as it continued to climb, it was getting closer to 30% to 40%, and not sure it
ever really got to the 50% in the six moves that you saw there. But it kind of gradually went up as every couple
moves happened in the last rebound with the Fed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Right. So, you never got like over 100% or anything like that on those last couple of moves?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
No, I don't think we ever got to 50% beta on any – even move six.

Hey, good morning, guys.

Good morning, Ryan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Daryl, maybe to start on the expenses. So, you're reiterating the $294 billion, and you're calling for expenses to
decline 3% to 4%. Can you maybe just talk high level about some of the puts and takes on the expenses as we
move into 2022? Clearly, the core is coming down due to expense saves, but we're hearing about – cost inflation
is increasing. You had a handful of insurance deals and insurance finance as well as investments in the business.
So, how should we think about costs into 2022? And maybe can they be down on an absolute or an adjusted
basis into next year? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, we're still putting together our plan for 2022, but I'll tell you what I can tell you now. From a cost
perspective, we have our five buckets that we talk about. We definitely will see more branch closures in the first
half of 2022, with almost 400 more branches closing. Also, we'll have more – less corporate real estate, so more
reductions in that space as 2022 comes along. But the big cost savings in technology will happen as we finish
through the conversions in the first quarter, the decommissioning. We're going to reduce about 40% of the
application systems and move towards from six data centers to three data centers. That will be big reductions in
cost saves. Bill talked about our continuation of our VSRP that will continue throughout in 2022. Then finally, we
had the team that led synergies program to basically get synergies on expenses and revenues, and that will play
out over the next couple of years. That will assure us to make sure that we get our expense targets and also give
us ammunition to make more investments in digital technology and other talent.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. And, Bill, last quarter, you were talking about green shoots in loan growth, and this quarter I think it
sounded a little bit more balanced although you are talking about core momentum. Can you maybe just talk about
expectations for loan growth over the next few quarters on both the consumer and the commercial side? What do
you see are some of the drivers, and could we see something like Service Finance starting to help drive
accelerating growth on the consumer side? Thanks.

William Henry Rogers A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. No.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Bill, before you start, can I finish that? So, Ryan, from a – still 2022 expenses. Inflation is real, and inflation is
definitely going to be in our numbers. If you look at the last couple of years, we did not really factor in inflation in
2020 and 2021. Not sure exactly what that number is, but it's probably give or take around 2% of the expense
base. And you also have to factor in acquisitions as well for 2022, and the impact of that would have both revenue
and expense. But at the end of the day, we're going to have good overall operating leverage, probably top quartile
when it's all said and done.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Thanks for the addition, Daryl. I think to that question, Ryan, that's the focus. I mean there are tons of puts
and takes, but we're going to hit the expense target that we committed to. I mean I feel very, very confident about
that and have a business that creates positive operating leverage and industry-leading efficiency. I mean that's
the shift and the target that we're headed to. I didn't mean to imply that there weren't green shoots. I still think
there are definitely green shoots. And I think they manifested themselves in this quarter as we highlighted.
When I think about loan growth as a output, I look at production paydowns, utilization, and pipelines. So, I lay
those four elements and then try to see where they're going. So, on the production side, we're hitting some high
points in the quarter for C&I and consumers. Our production is strong. Pay-downs are staying pretty consistent.
Pay-downs are about where they have been. Utilization is still pretty flat. You could say grinding up in certain
areas, but in fairness probably pretty, pretty flat. But pipelines are strong. I mean in CIG and CRE and CCB for us,
we're sort of at high points over the last several quarters in pipelines.
So, it's hard to guide. If I said if you have sort of medium-term ex-PPP, I think low-single digit kind of growth is at
the forefront. But our positioning, sort of longer-term when liquidity comes out of this, I just feel great about our
positioning. I mean, our capacity to – we've grown our revolver, so our utilization going up, the fantastic markets
we're in, the business investments that we've made in talent, the consumer businesses as you pointed out, point-
of-sale businesses, things are just adding capabilities and adding more opportunity for us to capture growth as we
go forward.
So, yes, I think there are green shoots. Hard to predict sort of when they're going to grow, but I feel really, really
good about how we're positioned.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
...can you share with us – you've done some smaller acquisitions, obviously the most recent one is the finance
company and then the insurance companies. Can you give us your picture of what you see maybe for added bolt-
on opportunities that could be on the horizon for Truist?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. I'd sort of say, first, as core Truist, I think the biggest opportunity is with Truist. I see the biggest opportunity
to actualize and optimize the opportunity that came from this fantastic merger of equals. So, let me sort of say that
as it's primary where we're going. But then the bolt-on, clearly, on the insurance side, I mean, we've had a
fantastic track record on the insurance side. It is a really good toggle between organic and inorganic growth and
managed well. And I would expect that to continue.
Maybe other things that look around and sort of bolt-on that are important to us strategically and add some scale.
We've been adding a lot of talent. I view that as the equivalent of an acquisition. So, we've been adding talent.
And you see the benefits of that, for example, in the investment banking side. But I think it's be fair to say bolt-on
in the places where we're experienced or where we have opportunity and then primary emphasis on Truist and
maximizing and optimizing this merger.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q

Very good. Thank you. And maybe this question could be directed to Clarke. The credit quality for you and many
of your peers has been outstanding, particularly in the net charge-off area. Can you, guys, give us a flavor? How
sustainable are these levels of very low net charge-offs? Is it another two or three quarters and then maybe
creeping up to normalization as we enter 2023 or end of 2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clarke R. Starnes III A
Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
It's a great question, Gerard. I know this is a lower or longer question for the industry. And I would say, for us in
the industry, we had significant stimulus, accommodation programs, and, frankly, strong asset values, and all of
those have been tailwinds. And you saw, for us, almost really historic [ph] low loss (00:44:11) point for the quarter.
So, we feel really good about where we are. And given the current economic backdrop, we would certainly expect

to continue to see outperformance with, to your point, a steady return over time to normalization as we go into
2022 and beyond.
And so, I think it can go on longer and it, again, depends on the economic scenario. But for us right now, I think
we would believe we have an opportunity to outperform, and you will that reflected in our 4Q guidance.

William Henry Rogers A

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
...just when you think longer term out about the points you made about operating leverage efficiency, maybe
there's some inflation, the business mix has changed. How confident do you remain in that low-50s long-term
efficiency ratio? And how much, if at all, is rates still part of that equation? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, I would start with industry-leading efficiency. So, let me sort of start with that as a concept. I think
given some normalization of rates, I feel really confident in the low 50s. But most importantly, being able to
achieve positive operating leverage, being able to sort of be industry-leading, top or top quartile efficiency, I think
is eminently short, medium, and long-term achievable for Truist.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Okay. Got it. And then just on the near-term perspective, can you just – Daryl, can you just walk us through when
we take the [ph] $29 million and $40 million (00:46:00) in the slides and you kind of add back the add-backs,
where approximately, just to put as a starting point, for the end of the year on a GAAP basis for cost?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, if you go back, you have to add back in incentive pieces, the acquisition pieces, as well as whatever
nonqualified turns out to be plus or minus. You probably get to – we gave guidance on an adjusted expense
number, down 3% to 4% from where we are today. That kind of is your starting off point for 2022.

Matt O'Connor Q

So, Bill, you took over as CEO about a month ago and also announced some changes to the senior leadership
team. Obviously, all of you guys have been in very prominent roles since the deal was announced. I wouldn't
expect meaningful changes, but any kind of tweaks that we should expect or kind of what was the process of
picking who kind of does what underneath you given some of the changes, however you want to frame that?
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, the great thing, Matt, is we have an incredibly strong, skilled, experienced, purposeful team. So, I'm
really fortunate to be surrounded by really great leaders. As you noted, I mean, we didn't want to put a lot of
change in place because actually I feel really good about the momentum and where things are going. So, the
leaders who are responsible for those businesses, we shifted a couple things around, but they still have the
primary responsibility that they had before.
I'd say that the shift was more, what I talked about in my opening statements, it's more of a transition from
merging to operating. That doesn't have anything to do with me or anything. Just has to do with the timing of
where we are in this process. Getting this major conversion this weekend was just a shot of adrenaline for us to
be fair. I mean, that's a big significant milestone for us and just gives us more confidence to be starting to shift
some of our time, some of our responsibilities, some of our focus to maximizing the opportunities that are Truist.

that, and I just think that's a function of timing and where we are and our confidence building.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And then just separately, can you talk about the retention of some of the kind of front office client-facing folks
really across the franchise? I would imagine initially there just wasn't that much movement because of COVID.
And I think you also had some retention agreements for key people. But just update us on how that's been going
kind of more recently as things have been opening up and maybe people, in general, are more open to looking
elsewhere, not just at Truist, but the workplace overall?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Let me put maybe a global perspective on it and then try to get a little more idiosyncratic to Truist. So,
globally, there's more activity and more people are moving, and we see that particularly in some of the frontline
areas. And you don't drive around any place in the country where you don't see help wanted sign. And we've got
several million people out of the workforce right now. So, we and the industry are experiencing some of that.
Going into this merger, our retention numbers in the first year to 18 months were actually better than they were at
either company. So, our retention numbers were really, really good. Turnover spiked up a little bit, but it's still I
think below where the industry is from everything that we can determine.
As it relates to some of our most senior team and what we sort of look at high-performer turnover is one of the
things that we look at in our senior team. I've been really pleased. I mean, we've been really solid in keeping the
kind of players we want. The retention on those has been really good. The places that I worry about are frontline
teller, care centers, all those things. That's just a more challenging environment today than it was before. And the
other side of that is our ability to attract talent is fantastic. I mean, the people that have wanted to join our
company and want to be part of what we're doing at Truist has exceeded any expectations that I might have had,
and they were really, really high.
So, the opportunity for people that are here to grow and expand their careers and the opportunity to bring new
talent in I think is just really, really good at Truist, all that again with that sort of global overlay of what's going on
in the market in the world.

Hi, Bill. You've spoken a lot about investing in technology and digital, and I think the expenses were a little
elevated before you've taken over the CEO reigns. So, it's good seeing that you're guiding for expenses to be 3%
to 4% lower next quarter. But can you just talk – I think it was your quote saying, once the hoods open, let's fix the
engine a little bit more than we could have otherwise done. So, where is the digital dividend, so to speak, going to
come from as it relates to Truist and the extra efforts that you're putting in place? So, if you can talk about the

back office with the cloud or the front office with enhanced digital banking that you maybe didn't have before.
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Mike, it's a great question, and I think about in two ways. One, digital dividend, as you put it, but also the
avoidance of opportunity cost, and that's really what's happened with this merger. So, if you think about it in sort
of a core basis, we're creating a much more agile platform, so the ability to move fast, to add, to create more
opportunities for our clients, our teammates on a more agile platform. So, the base is really important.
I then think we have a new state-of-the-art commercial ecosystem. We have a new state-of-the-art mortgage
ecosystem. We have a new state-of-the-art digital platform. All of those, in my mind, are opportunity costs. So,
those are things we don't have to invest in disproportionately going forward, and it create the opportunity to
expand and add, too, as we go into the next few years.
The other part of that is something we call the digital straddle. This thing that we did to convert our clients digitally
I think is actually fairly unique. And what that allows us to do, again, from an agility standpoint, is to leverage that
backend platform, and we can through the use of APIs in the straddle. we can do a whole lot more for our clients
than we could before. So, when the hood is up, yeah, we've been looking at sort of virtually everything. So, the
hood up and the best of both mentality has allowed us to not only expand and create a better ecosystem, but I
also look at it as it avoid a lot of opportunity cost in the future of having to do these major, major changes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So, you said you still you're still committed I guess to low 50s efficiency. It just seems like it's been a long way. I
mean, the stocks underperformed since the merger was announced despite a merger on paper that has the
chance to be one of the best mergers ever. And I think part of the reason for the underperformance may have
been we had the pandemic, we had the low rates, so there are some excuses there. But, looking ahead, are you
able to commit to positive operating leverage next year given the weight, given all these investments? I mean,
you're avoiding costs, you're getting gains from the technology investments. I think investors are kind of thinking,
okay, let's see more of that digital dividend, let's see more of that payoff. How much can you lead us or give a little
bit more hope as it relates to positive operating leverage?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Maybe I have a little more than hope. So, no, no, I think it's totally reasonable to expect us to have a positive
operating for next year in the middle of this merger. And that's against investments we want to make, that's
overcoming inflation, that's overcoming all the other things that exist, rate environment, pandemic, all those type
things.
Now, we're committed to having a business that has positive operating leverage and has industry-leading
efficiency. I mean, I feel more confident about that today than I did the day we announced the merger. So, it's
sometimes hard to peel back the clouds and the merger costs and the onetimes, and all that to see that. But the
underlying capacity of our company to deliver positive operating leverage growth on the top line and world-class
efficiency is absolutely there.

John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Morning. Daryl, just wanted to clarify, the outlook for net interest income next quarter, I think you said on a
reported basis, down 1%, on a core net interest income, flattish. Just clarify if that was the guide. And then, how
does that set you up more broadly for growing NII into 2022 when you think about all the puts and takes there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, you are correct, we will have stable NII and the core basis in the fourth quarter will be down 1% just
because of purchase accounting accretion. As 2022 plays out, when I look at 2022, as we put this together, there
are three big drivers of NII. The impacts will be loan growth, deposit growth, depending on how large the balance
sheet gets and how much liquidity we invest, and then interest rates. When I look at all that I think it's very
possible that – I'm very sure that the core net interest income will grow. I think we have a chance of having it
offset overall the runoff for purchase accounting. It doesn't take – a huge amount of loan growth coupled with a
Fed move, that's not in the implied right now, but even a steepening of the yield curve would add. So, if you just
steepen the yield curve like 25 basis points, that would give us another $100 million in for the year next year.
So, I think there's a lot of variables that could play out, but we feel pretty good that trajectory of core net interest
margin will rise in 2022 and that our reported net interest margin should be relatively stable if we can offset that.

Okay. And, Bill, just a bigger picture question in terms of the capital target and what you need to run the company.
You brought down the capital target CET1 to 9.75%. It seems like you'll get there with the Service Finance
acquisition soon. So, longer term, what will be the factors as you think about lowering that capital to maybe
something closer to what shares that look like you target on CET1?

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2021
Yeah. And, John, remember, we also announced we'll do some more share repurchase this quarter, so to get
there faster. I mean, we said all along. I mean, we went into the merger with a little bit of a higher capital base
very intentionally. And what we said was is the risk of the merger decreases and the solid definition of the
economy increases. We have a company that has a lower-than-average risk profile and a higher-than-average
PPNR profile. So, I think we'll start thinking about capital positions that reflect that.
We don't want to do this on a quarter-by-quarter basis. I mean, this is sort of a long-term strategy and philosophy.
But this weekend was a good milestone for us in terms of reducing the risk of the merger and our confidence of
where we are in the first part of next year. We'll get that behind us and we'll continue to evaluate where we are
from a capital standpoint. No reason to think we're going to change the profile of our company, our
diversifications. Our risk profile is going to stay strong and we're confident in the [ph] PPR (00:59:31) components
of the growth in our business.

Got it. Okay. Great. So, yeah, not quarter to quarter, but getting through the conversions will be a big factor as
you think about lowering that target over time.

William Henry Rogers A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, I think you've got it. I think we've got to be in the first part of next year to have another conversation about
this. But we're going to be thoughtful and moving to the existing target quickly.
