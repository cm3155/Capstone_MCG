Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Sergio. Thank you to everyone for joining us this morning. I will say, when I look at the first half of the
year, I will say that we continue to show the main features of our bank in the sense that we continue to grow.
Growth has been one of the features that we get during all time. And the growth is reflected both in customers,
volumes of our deposits, mutual funds and loans. And also, we translate this into revenues into the operating
profit that grew 13% year-on-year on constant euros, so our operating income consistently keeps growing.
We delivered volumes, well-diversified across regions and businesses. The performers were supported during
this year, particularly in the pandemia by increasing digitalization with the strong growth in digital customers and
digital sales.
Q1 profit, we translate this growth in volumes into profitability. Q2 2021 profit was €2.1 billion, including the Single
Resolution Fund contribution of almost €370 million. Excluding this, quarter-on-quarter growth was 8%. No
extraordinary items were recoded this quarter.
The first half of the year, we reached a recurrent – a attributable profit of €3.6 billion. As you know, we did a [ph]
charge for (00:03:28) restructuring cost in the first Q. So at the end, the underlying profit was €4.2 billion, the
largest since 2010. The return on tangible equity increased to 12.6%.
Compared to the first half of 2020, revenue was higher, efficiency improved, and the cost of credit dropped
notably to 94 basis points. First, we announced the agreement to acquire Amherst Pierpont in the US and a
proposal to acquire the minority for we don't own in SCUSA, the 20% we do not own today.
Our capital position remains solid. This Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.11% above our target range, and we
continue to generate organically capital Q-on-Q, and risk-weighted assets growth on the accrual for – and the
accrual for shareholder remuneration inside our range of 40% to 50% payout.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2021
Finally, our tangible net asset value per share increased 4% this quarter to around €4 per share. In short, I will
say, we achieved our targets. We exceed our targets in the first half, and we remain very focused on building a
more resilient inclusive and greener businesses.
So when we go to the revenue generation in the quarter, as I said, we kept growing the customer base, 3%. As
you may expect, the digital transactions kept booming in this environment, plus 38%, and digital sales increased
by 8 percentage points. As you can see, this well spread across the board among the different products,
mortgages, consumer, cards, deposits, investments, insurance. So digitalization is making a good progress
across the board.
At the same time, [ph] we relate these (00:05:28), as I mentioned before, to our income that kept growing, keep
growing, operating income and efficiency. On the back of our efficiency plan, our cost-to-income ratio improves to
45.7%. At the same time, and this is important, we are top 3 in NPS in seven markets in which we work and this is
well-recognized by the market.
Going to the P&L, moving to the – the exchange rate has difference – with our quarters, has very small impact in
the quarter. But still has a strong negative impact year-on-year, minus 7 percentage points in revenue, around 6
percentage points in cost.
Looking at the results on constant euro basis, revenue grew mainly in those related with customers. Cost
discipline in an environment that inflation is accelerating all across the board, we continue to reduce loan loss
provisions compared with the previous quarter and we improved the cost of credit, which I will describe later in
more detail.
We didn't record any extraordinary items in Q2. Recall that we recoded the €530 million restructuring cost in Q1.
Additionally, in the same period last year, we recorded the goodwill adjustments. We delivered a first half
underlying profit of €4.2 billion.
Importantly, and is – I want to underline this, all regions in global business are performing very well. All our three
regions contributed roughly to 30% of the group profits with strong profit increases in all of them. Once again, the
US performance [ph] is down south (00:07:17) with a profit of circa €700 in Q2 and €1.3 billion in the first half of
2021.
Digital Consumer Bank, which contributes to 11% of the group underlying profit, also increased its profit
significantly, amid a challenging environment in the first month of the year. Regarding our global businesses, CIB
had another excellent quarters, around €500 million net profit in the quarter after a record performance in the
previous quarter.
Wealth Management & Insurance has gradually recovered in recent quarters and grew at double-digit rates, both
in volumes and fees in the first half of this year. This positive performance by region, together with the support of
our global business, continues to demonstrate that our geographical business diversification is a fundamental
pillar of our business model.
We see trends – we see consistent trend across the board. NII and fees increased and reached pre-pandemic
levels. I will run you through these in more detail in the following slides. Cost control and the costs of higher
inflation and increased expenses are related with higher activity. Loan-loss provisions declined 13% with a
widespread improvement in the cost of credit. In short, a very good quarter, reflecting the rebound on activity that
was more intense [ph] in the (00:08:40) quarter, particularly in the month of June.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2021
If we go to the NII. We grew the NII 8% compared with the first half 2020, and 3% quarter-on-quarter as a result of
higher volumes quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year with a widespread growth by region and country. Regarding
margin management, we saw repricing liabilities in Europe, mainly UK, Mexico – in Europe, mainly in UK, Mexico
and Chile, and improving loan spreads in US, UK and Poland. In addition, there was a positive impact form the
TLTRO.
Finally, average interest rates continue to have a negative impact despite the hikes in Brazil, plus 200 basis points
since June 2020; Mexico, plus 25% (sic) [25 basis points] (00:09:29) in June 2021; and Chile, plus 25% – 25
basis points in July. These increases will materialize positively in NII in the coming quarters.
When it comes to the fee income, they reflect clearly the rebound on activity. In this slide, you have several key
products and you see the growth compared with the first half of 2020 and quarter-on-quarter. The quarter-on-
quarter, I am going to focus more on the quarter-on-quarter, was particularly intense on the back of the – some
normalization.
I will not say, full normalization of activity levels, but it was this some normalization, you can see that we are
growing strongly in the main business of the bank being from traditional business like acquiring business, cars, or
the business in private banking or CIB that this quarter grew – decreased versus previous one, but the previous
one was kind of an extraordinary quarter. We expect as the normalization progress, this will continue in the
coming quarters.
In cost, as you know, our efficiency improved 159 basis points year-on-year. That's a good track record. Europe
recorded the highest efficiency savings, 8-percentage point reduction that is a quantum net. We continued to see
significant increase in inflation in all countries, particularly in the US, where inflation have the biggest jump since
2008. In this context, group costs rose 3%. In real terms, excluding inflation, costs were 0.4% lower after the
investments in IT.
In Europe, costs were 1.5% lower making – we are progressing [indiscernible] (00:11:27). We are reducing €1
billion cost in Europe. Spain had a 7% decrease. UK is lagging a little bit behind, but we will accelerate in the
second quarter and onwards in the region. Efficiency in the region in Europe stood at 51%.
In North America, cost increased 7%, mainly driven by technology expenses and amortizations. In real terms, US
increased 3% and Mexico fell 2%. Efficiency in the region stood at 43%. In South America, the increase in cost,
7%, was greatly distorted by the very high inflation in Argentina. In real terms, cost declined 3% in the region,
Brazil minus 6%, Chile minus 1% and Argentina plus 6%. Efficiency in the region stood at 34%. Finally in Digital
Consumer Bank cost increase is due to changes in perimeters, six of the leasing business we bought one year
ago in Germany and some investments on the utilization. So we'll continue to do the transformation of the bank
and this will have reflect in our cost and conversion ratio as we progress in our transformation plans particularly in
terms in Europe where we are committed to deeper transformation of the business.
The cost of credit, while I mentioned number, 0.94%, 94 basis points, 79 basis points in the last six months. This
set our expectations well probably for the whole year. We will be running at this level at around 1% cost of risk for
the whole year. The NPL ratio remains basically flat. The loan-loss reserve still in €24 billion in the balance sheet.
We think non-performing loan coverage ratio 73%, while the overall, what we are seeing, the trends we're seeing,
and the cost of risk, we are seeing better [indiscernible] (00:13:31) than the one embedded in our models for all
the individual suspensions, the mortgage being consumer on the back of lower unemployment than the one
estimate in our models, and actually better house prices in our marked book that leads to a lower potential cost of

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2021
risk in this space, in companies particularly in SMEs were still in a proven mode. While we are seeing a recovery,
we need to see how intense is the recovery, and once we assess this, we will be in a position to assess this. So
compared with our expectations one year ago, the situation is much better than the one we were embedding in
our models.
The profitability ratios on the back of this strong results naturally and the return on tangible equity went to 12.6%.
The underlying EPS north of €0.22 per share, and the TNAV 4% quarter-on-quarter. Well, I will say is the return
on tangible equity and return on risk-weighted assets are higher than in 2019. So those are the main ratios. And
going to capital, we continue to generate capital organically in the quarter, 7 basis points with a profit earning. We
are accruing a 50% payout on underlying profits, and this is in the organic capital generation. Regulatory and
model-related impacts were 24 basis points in the quarter, and well, basically the counterparty credit risk,
counterparty risk on derivative operations 11 basis points and TRIM on low default closures where the impact was
9 basis points.
After that, the correct Tier 1 phased-in ratio was 12.11%. So we are above our target, above the upper limit of the
range, 11%, 12%. And we enjoy a significant, very large margin buffer. So additionally, while the group is still
conducted by EVA, we will probably describe it, we expect to continue to show a consistent performance on this
[indiscernible] (00:16:15) the previous one we came always at the top with the capital depletion being one of the
lowest among our peers in Europe. So I will say that our capital generation and the organically continues to
support our medium, long-term goals. So with our strong tangible equity progress into our goal of having a
medium-term target 13% to 15%, this should allow us to grow significantly the business to have a payout in the
range of 40% to 50%, and to face the potential regulatory impact that may come down on the road.
And finally, let me comment a little bit on the ESG. We made strong commitment on ESG. On the environmental
side, we were become a founding member of Net-Zero Banking Alliance. This requires some specific targets in
power generation, oil and gas. And we already published our target for the Net-Zero Banking Alliance in power
generation. We're working in three different directions in the environmental issues, improving our financial product
to support customers, issuing in our own green bonds that we used this year already €1 billion green bonds as
part of our global sustainable debt plan.
And finally, mobilizing green finance. We mobilized this year in the first half €8 billion in green finance, bringing
our total of €42 million since the beginning of our commitment in 2019. So we are the market leader in the
renewable sector, financing the renewable sector and we'll continue to lead renewables project finance league
tables.
On the social side, while the Santander finance for all helps people to get access to the financial system, this is
similarly important in the microcredit business and also in the financial education. We have, as you now,
microfinance alternatives already launched in Brazil, Mexico, Uruguay and Colombia and we'll be launching it in
Peru this year. As a result of this, we were recognized as the Best Bank for Sustainable Finance in Latin America
by Euromoney. In governance, we have clear and robust governance across group of subsidiaries. We ensured
ongoing board effectiveness, balanced tenure and diversity. In addition, we included ESG metrics in our executive
bonus scorecard.
And now, I will hand the call to José that will continue to elaborate about the regional business how they are
performing in different countries.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2021
Thank you, José Antonio, and good morning everyone. I will [indiscernible] (00:19:07) with a brief summary of the
regions, and then I will elaborate on the main countries. In Europe, we are accelerating One Santander's
transformation which enables us to progress towards our medium-term targets. We have positive volume growth
year-on-year almost in all markets following the trends that we've seen since the beginning of the year. Revenue
increased 14% year-on-year, cost control was maintained and efficiency improved. In addition, we had loan-loss
provision introductions in most countries and a lower cost of risk at 49 basis points.
In North America, strong profit growth boosted by cost of credit improvements in the US. Cost control and
revenue increased, revenues increased 8% excluding disposals. Return on tangible equity in the region was 15%.
The group announced several transactions, which I will explain later. In South America, we are strengthening
regional ties in order to continue growing profitably, supported by record new customer increase in recent months.
We had a strong rise in loyal customers, up 24% and in digital customers, up 20%, reflected in double-digit
volume growth, return on tangible equity reached 20%.
In the Digital Consumer Bank, we also saw positive performance year-on-year after the significant pickup in
activity in the quarter. So in summary, we have delivered robust performance in all regions in the quarter. Let me
now analyze the main countries in more detail. In Spain, as the economic activity started to show signs of
recovery, our stock of loans expanded 1% in the quarter, new mortgage lending reached its highest level in the
last three years, and consumer lending recovered to pre-pandemic levels. On a year-on-year basis, the loan
portfolio increased mainly in SMEs and corporates, which lagged after the 2020 boost on [indiscernible]
(00:21:00).
Quarter-on-quarter underlying profit was heavily affected by the SFR contribution, €116 million in Spain.
Excluding these, net operating income was 4% higher, with a positive performance in fee, income and cost. In the
first half, profits increased 56% year-on-year, NII grew 10%, driven by TLTRO and active management of funding
costs. Fee income recovered to pre-pandemic levels on the back of transactional fees, the insurance and mutual
funds, we show a record inflows in the first half. We reduced cost by 7%, reaching an efficiency ratio which is well
below peers' average. Positive [indiscernible] (00:21:42) in the period delivered over 16% growth in pre-provision
profit. With regards to provisions, we'll remain cautious as to the recovery of the key sectors in the Spanish
economy such as tourism. For the second half of the year, we expect the trends to continue with a slight increase
in loans and deposit volumes. Revenue should recover to pre-pandemic levels at low single-digit rates. And in
costs, we expect to maintain the trend, the downward trend with a 7% decrease in costs by year-end.
In the UK, we had a strong increase in total income driven by NII growth of 29% year-on-year. This was a result of
management actions to replace deposits reflected in NII and net interest margin improvement of 26 basis points
year-on-year. In addition, volumes grew driven by mortgages and government-backed business loans. Costs
continue its downward trend, reflecting progress on our transformation program, which resulted in strong
efficiency improvement of 13 percentage points. Loan loss provision releases of €86 million in the quarter reflect
the absence of significant charges and an improved economic outlook. In short, another positive quarter with a
strong increase in profitability. We expect to maintain a positive trend in NII for the year-end, while costs should
drop as the optimization plans are executed. We don't see signs of deterioration in asset quality.
Brazil continued to deliver excellent performance in terms of volumes and profitability. We maintain a strong
growth in new mortgage lending to individuals, which reached a record high in card sales and significant income
growth in Getnet. In auto, will remain the leader in individuals. As a result, loans grew 15% and customer deposits
11%. Profit was 44% higher year-on-year, and return on tangible equity increased to 22%. Total income rose 9%
backed by positive NII performance. Here, larger volumes offset margin pressures arising from lower average
interest rates, although they increased in the quarter, and net fee income growth.

Higher productivity and expense management enabled us to continue to reach record efficiency levels. Loan-loss
provisions decreased strongly with a positive cost of credit performance, which fell to 3.51%, down 116 basis
points year-on-year. Compared to the first quarter, profit is up 6%. Net interest income and fee income up 7%,
offset lower gains on financial transactions and higher provisions in individuals.
So, in short, we continue to experience healthy growth with very positive revenue performance, gaining market
share in key segments, while reducing the cost of credit quarter-on-quarter, leading to efficiency and improving
customer attraction and loyalty. We expect to see the same trends in the second half.
In the US, the work conducted over the last few years made us to be uniquely positioned to benefit from
improving market conditions. Loan growth was impacted by Bluestem and Puerto Rico disposals. Excluding
perimeter changes, growth was 1% year-on-year with auto origination increasing 29% year-on-year in the first
half. Very positive P&L performance. The US was the largest contributor to the group's underlying profit, both in
the second quarter and in the first half, reaching €700 million and €1.3 billion, respectively.
Net operating income increased on the back of resilient NII, where deposit pricing actions offset lower rates,
strong auto leasing, as well as Wealth Management and cards fee income. Excluding the disposals impact, net
operating income increased 23%.
Loan-loss provisions decreased sharply, as improved macro outlook, customer loan relief and increased used car
prices led to a strong credit performance. Again, the first quarter profit up due to better performance on leases
and the release of loan-loss provisions. Excluding the Bluestem disposal impact, profit was up 14%.
In line with the group's strategy to accelerate growth in the US, we announced two transactions: the proposal to
acquire all outstanding shares of Santander Consumer we already don't own, which is around 20%, and the
agreement to acquire Amherst Pierpont Securities. These transactions follow our strategy to reduce complexity,
increase profitability with minimal additional operational risk, and increase business' diversification by expanding
our exposure to corporates. Both transactions follow a rigorous financial discipline and goals, and strengthen our
business model and profitable growth.
In the second half, we would expect to maintain our strong performance in net operating income with double-digit
growth through deposit pricing, strong Wealth Management and CIB fee income performance, and continued
momentum in auto leases. Loan-loss provision expense is forecasted to have a significant improvement against
last year, although we would expect to see a gradual normalization in the second half after an abnormally low first
half, as I just mentioned.
In Mexico, our multichannel innovation continued to strengthen our value proposition, which enable us to increase
our loyal and digital customer base at double-digit rates. Lending showed a strong performance in auto loans and
mortgages, gaining market share. However, the total loan portfolio decreased in line with a system, which was still
affected by corporate loans normalization. We continued to shift our funding mix towards demand deposits and
mutual funds.
Profit was slowly down – slightly down year-on-year. Total income fell, impacted by NII pressure from low rates
and volumes and lower trading gains due to ALCO sales in the second quarter of last year. On the other hand, fee
income increased, driven by transactional revenues. Costs fell 2% in real terms, despite higher technology
investments and amortizations. Loan-loss provisions dropped 21%, leading to a cost of risk below 3%.

In addition and in line with the group strategy, the tender offer to acquire the outstanding shares of Santander
Mexico that we don't own, 8.3%, is on track to be launched on the third quarter, subject to the regulatory
approvals. In the second half, we would expect recoveries in volumes, fees growing at high single digit rates, and
a gradual pickup in AII – in NII. Loan-loss provisions should decrease against 2020.
In the Digital Consumer Bank, in consumer lending, activity trends improved. New lending performed very well in
the second quarter after pandemic controls eased in Central Europe, delivering 20% growth year-on-year. In the
quarter, profit headwinds included the SRF, the Single Resolution [ph] Board (00:29:03) contribution, exclude any
profits would have been up 6%, a higher provision related to the Swiss franc mortgage portfolio in Poland.
On the other hand, the recovering activity was reflected in NII, fee income and cost of risk improvement. In the
first half, profits – sorry, in the first half, profit was up 11%, higher year-on-year. Costs grew 5% year-on-year due
to changes in perimeter, remember [ph] SIXT and TIMFin (00:29:32) and investments in digitalization. On a like-
for-like basis, costs were down. For the coming quarters, we expect a strong cyclical growth in consumer finance
demand, delivering a mid-single-digit growth in revenue, flattish costs, and cost of risk that would remain more or
less at between 60 to 70 basis points.
Let me now review the global businesses, started with CIB. As José Antonio mentioned, CIB delivered another
excellent quarter in activity and results, although, obviously, the quarter-on-quarter comparison was affected by
the very, very strong record-high first quarter 2021. In the first half, CIB held leading positions in the rankings of
structured finance, we were first globally by a number of transactions; DCM, first in Spain and top three in Mexico
and Chile; and ECM, top three in Spain, Mexico and Poland.
We had outstanding first half results, backed by overall revenue improvement across businesses, mainly in
markets and global transactional banking. We expect that performance for 2021 to continue to be very positive,
although probably in a more normalized trends.
On Wealth Management & Insurance, total assets under management increased double-digit year-on-year, both
by market movement and commercial inflows in Private Banking and Santander Asset Management of more than
€9 billion, which account for 2% of the total volume managed. In Insurance, gross written premiums rose 12%
year-on-year, mainly by non-credit related protection business.
In summary, total fee income grew 10% and total contribution to the group's profits was up 9% year-on-year. In
the second half, we expect to continue the same strong business dynamics, delivering double-digit growth in fees
and profits.
In PagoNxt, as you know, well, payments is the cornerstone of our strategy to grow and reinforce our customer to
loyalty. In the first half, revenue increased 23% year-on-year boosted by the strong jump in fees, 39% higher at
constant exchange rates. And we expect revenues to grow strongly in the second half around 50% and reach €1
billion in the medium term. To provide some context behind our growth in PagoNxt, let me share background on
our three businesses.
Merchant Solutions. Getnet is already one of the top three acquirers in Latin America. And we continue to develop
our capabilities across our technological hubs in America, Europe and Asia. We recorded a solid performance in
the quarter, exceeding pre-pandemic levels in active merchants and total payment volumes. Getnet Brazil
recorded a strong commercial performance, reaching more than 15.5% market share. Getnet in Chile launched its
commercial activity, and Mexico progressed in its migration plan to the global platform. Getnet also operates in
Argentina.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2021
We continue to invest in Europe, as our former domestic acquiring business in Spain evolved to Getnet Europe.
And we'll be providing European customers with integrated offerings before the year end. All in all, we reached a
total of around 1.2 million active merchants, up 24% year-on-year, and a total payments volume of close to €50
billion in the first half, up 53% year-on-year.
The second component is Trade Solutions, which support SMEs and corporates that operate internationally
through the state-of-the-art solutions. One Trade is already connected to our customers in eight countries after its
recent rollouts in Mexico and Poland. This solution has over 6,000 active customers, up 50% versus the first
quarter of the year. We expect to increase exponentially as we add new services. Ebury, we continue to invest in
credit developments and platforms, although volumes and revenues were temporarily impacted by the pandemic.
Finally, in Customer Solution – in Consumer Solutions, we will be soon rolling out a new global platform in
Argentina, Peru, and Colombia.
And now, let me finish with the Corporate Centre. We can see that results improved 6% compared to the first half
of last year, mainly due to the continued positive trend in operating expenses and the decrease in loan-loss
provisions and other provisions due to the one-off provisions recorded in the first half of last year for certain
stakes whose value was affected by the crisis. On the other hand, net interest income was impacted by the
increase in the liquidity buffer and we also had lower gains on financial transactions. As you remember, we
recorded positive foreign currency hedging results in 2020.
And let me turn it back to José Antonio for his concluding remarks. Thank you very much.

José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, José. I'm going to take just one minute to sum up a little bit the result we present to you. I will say our
first half results were solid and consistent across geographies and businesses, supported by volume growth,
strong revenue, efficiency improvement, better cost of credit, core equity Tier 1 above our target range, and return
on tangible equity is higher, really higher than the cost of [ph] equity (00:34:56).
Looking forward, we'll continue our strategic transformation, growing and increasing profitability, while we help our
customers and societies by building a strong customer base, achieving greater customer satisfaction with our
services, helping out our customers to become more digitalized.
Based on the results obtained year-to-date, and our conservative business view for the second half, I believe we
are well on track to outperform our full-year 2021 goals. We expect to close the year with a cost of credit around
1% and increase our profitability ratio as well over 10%.
Finally, we remain at your disposals for the questions you may have to us. Thank you.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2021
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And the first question is coming from...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sergio Gámez Martínez A
Global Head-Shareholder & Investor Relations, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. Can we move to the Q&A session, please?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Certainly. It's coming from the line of Adrian Cighi from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go
ahead.

Adrian Cighi Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd.
Hi, there. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I have two, one on capital and one on the US
acquisitions. On capital, you've taken a big chunk of regulatory headwinds this quarter. Can you remind us of how
much more in terms of headwinds you have to take in the second half of the year and potentially, even for 2022, if
you have that visibility?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sergio Gámez Martínez A
Global Head-Shareholder & Investor Relations, Banco Santander SA
Excuse me. We have some problem. Bear with us one minute.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Adrian Cighi Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd.
And the second question is on the US acquisitions. You've clearly shown a high-level confidence in your capital
position, but can you give us a little bit more color on how you see capital allocation between the returns and the
growth, organic and inorganic? Should we expect this sort of bolt-on acquisition to be a regular feature of
Santander going forward? And can you maybe discuss whether you see any technical or regulatory barrier for
Santander not looking at buying back the Brazil minorities at some point in the future? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Let me to elaborate on our – on the capital. I said to you on the presentation, on the main presentation that
looking at the medium term, the way we see our capital and how we – as you know, we established a medium-
term target for return on tangible equity of – in the region of 13% to 15% starting for this. And given the evolution
we have in the business, we think this is achievable, clearly, achievable. And we'll – I remain very confident that
we will achieve this.
If I look at how to going to deploy the capital we generate through the business, I will look for a kind of a risk-
weighted asset growth. This is a growth story. Particularly, we're going to grow double-digit in Latin America,
yeah, naturally maybe some currency depreciation. But, well, we are aiming for double-digit growth in Latin
America, also significant growth in our consumer business in the US, while in Europe we see a more kind of
flattish evolution of the risk-weighted assets.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2021
Now, this will lead us to a kind of growth of risk-weighted asset, let's say, in the region of 3% to 5% probably year-
on-year. And on top of this, we have our payout policy that is to remunerate the shareholders 40% to 50%. And
you do the math, we have some spare capacity on top of this to face potential regulatory risks that we're going to
have still some to come with the Basel III, particularly, one, is still a bit far from us, has been delayed for several
times, but still there.
And finally, we have some spare capacity to, well, maybe to – as you [indiscernible] (00:39:06) to do buybacks, to
do [ph] smallest (00:39:09) decisions now. And we have not contemplated any kind of bold acquisition of a large
size. So, this is, in my mind, the capital evolution going forward. And I feel very confident that we're going to stay
up in the upper end of our range 11%, 12% for the coming quarters and, probably, coming years. As always,
probably, too early to say, but probably, in the coming years is pretty much the same.

Operator: Our second question is coming from the line of Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Your line is
open. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alvaro Serrano Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
Good morning. Thanks. It's actually two follow-up questions also on capital in the US. So on capital, I just want to
confirm the headwinds year-to-date, I think, of 37 basis points, I think your guidance was 40 basis points. Is there
anything that's going better or worse and – there that you can share for the rest of the year? And also a follow-up
to the question I asked in Q1. Have you given any further thought of splitting your distribution between dividend
and share buybacks, and any color you can give on maybe helping us quantify any share buybacks that you
might be thinking about and when can you be more precise about that?
And the second question more strategic on the US is, you bought the minority, SCUSA; you've also bought a
FICC broker in the US. I just wanted to ask you if you could elaborate on the strategic rationale behind the two,
presuming on the FICC broker you're after the dollar clearing. But it seems – the timing seems odd on both
acquisitions, I would argue. So, can you talk about why now and what are you trying to build in the US? Is it a
universal bank, consumer bank used to be too big to integrate with the retail, just some thoughts on your footprint
in the US? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Let me to elaborate a – surprises in capital. Basically, probably, I wouldn't say we have had surprises.
Probably, the only one, probably, José want to comment, probably, more because of the regulatory issues than
the one we were expecting at the beginning of the year, probably, in the region of 5 basis points, 10 basis points
more.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2021
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. We – the two things that are coming a bit above our expectations are the new definition of [ph] default
(00:41:46). Remember that the regulators said that they would expect neutral capital impact from that and it's
going to be very far from the neutral. And also a bit worse in the counterparty credit risk for derivatives that we
already accounted for in the second quarter. So, probably, we would expect, if we said 40 to 45, maybe 10 basis
points more this year than we had initially expected.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. The second question, you asked me to elaborate about the buyback. Well, as you know, last Friday, the
[ph] ECB (00:42:22), well, communicated that the bank on dividends will be over at the end of September.
Currently, our remuneration policy to shareholders stays in the 40% to 50%. Beside that, naturally we – the board
by [indiscernible] (00:42:42) is going to contemplate different options. Naturally, cash dividends and buyback can
be in the table. Mainly, with the share price trading clearly below tangible net asset value per share is clearly an
option that is – can be quite compelling at some point.
The third question was related to US, our strategy in the US. In the US, the way we look at the business in the
US, we have independently of the legal structure, we have like three, four businesses there. We have a pretty
strong consumer finance building businesses, basically in SCUSA with the origination capabilities that are quite
strong, as we've shown through, well, many years already.
Second, we have a good and growing deposit base in SBNA that is growing. We were able to reprice
substantially. And if you see our numbers, our NII has been performing better than our competitors due to our
ability to [ph] reduce (00:43:48) the cost of our deposit base and at the same time cost of deposits base. We are
not taking advantage of this deposit base to fund the consumer business in the full extension. That is an
opportunity clearly there. There, we had the [ph] block (00:44:01) in the CIB businesses. That last year probably
grew more than 20%; this year, keep growing significantly. And we have these fixed-income broker in order to
keep growing in the CIB space. And finally, we have the Private Banking business in Miami. That, well, as you
know, is a very profitable business and is growing nicely, well, into double digits.
So, when I look at the business in – from this point of view, we have very good opportunities to be much more
efficient in the US, combining our capabilities in different angles and keep growing, particularly in the CIB
Consumer space; Wealth Management, both onshore and offshore; and developing some specialty business that
we have inside SBNA that offer returns in the 16%, 17% region, like the multifamily business that we plan to
expand.
So, taking all of these and looking from this point of view, our business, we are keen to growing in the US
organically, our business. And we think that we can have returns significantly above our cost of equity with this
combination of business going forward.

Operator: Next up, we have a question from Andrea Filtri from Mediobanca. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrea Filtri Q
Analyst, Mediobanca SpA (United Kingdom)
Yes. Thank you for taking my questions. I have a just follow-up and one on Spain. On follow-up, therefore, if we
get it correctly, you're basically upping the guidance on regulatory headwinds from basically 40 to 55 basis points
this year and I didn't understand if you also had any expectations on 2022, as the stock has kind of reacted in a
flattish way to a clear beat to results. It seems like the capital is holding the stock back today.
And on Spain, the cost of risk seems to remain high and certainly not reflecting the same evolution of the other
geographies. What is your outlook there? Are you essentially trying to anticipate and bringing forward some future
trends? Or you're being cautious or it's simply that the visibility remains low and, therefore, the cost of risk stays
high? And still on the cost of risk front, what is the actual mechanical timing for you to allocate the overlay
provisions of last year? And if the macro does not materialize in line with your expectations, when would you
actually release those overlay provisions [ph] by (00:47:15)? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. I will take the cost of risk questions, and I'll pass the capital question to José. So, the question – your
question, Andrea, in relation with the cost of risk in Spain, let me to share with you my thoughts on this, yeah. So,
as I said in the presentation, we have on one side the individual families in consumer and mortgages, where we
are seeing substantial better trends that is one that were embedded in our models last year [indiscernible]
(00:47:49) based on the expected losses in the future. That's clearly a positive on the back of, I mentioned also
before, lower unemployment and the one we were expecting and better [ph] house (00:48:02) prices than the one
we were anticipating at that time, yeah, so – and this apply to individuals.
When it comes to SMEs, the situation is much more uncertain, yeah. So, well, it's true that the economies are
rebounding. It's also true that the Spanish economy, given the relative specialization in tourist-related activities,
the rebound need to be seen. Still we are midway to this rebound. And based on the behavior of the economy, I
think that it's too early to call [ph] the situation of value (00:48:39) to be cautious.
When do I do think that we're going to have more visibility, probably, when we see the economy fully open and we
see tourism industry recovering or going to more normal activity. Probably, this is three quarters from now, four
quarters from now. It's not for sure we're going to be in next quarter, because we are still in the middle of the –
this Delta strain that is creating some lockdowns here and there, and [ph] we're definitely (00:49:12) at this stage
to be cautious. So, probably, for this year, because of [ph] risk (00:49:17) in Spain, my best estimation is we're
14

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2021
going to remain as it is. And I will expect next year to come down significantly. But I will tell you that the
environment we're in, I advise you to be cautious, particularly, on the SME space.
Cost of risk, the mechanical – the time to release the overlay and to – well, we're going to go into our internal
budgeting, but it still depends basically how comfortable do we feel to assess a material different economic
scenario than the one we embedded in our models last year. As of today, I will say that the scenario, the current
scenario I have in my mind is materially better than the one we assessed one year ago. So this will lead to some
or significant releases, depending on the jurisdictions.
When this is going to happen? It may happen, and this is a discussion with [ph] risk on – the risk department
(00:50:25), it may happen in the fourth quarter in this year. It may happen first quarter, second quarter next year,
depends on the economic situation and on how down the economic situation is, particularly, is related with
COVID, yeah. As long as we have COVID, some potential lockdowns here and there, probably, is not advisable to
do that, but at some point, we need to do that, yeah.
And as of today, this will lead to releases. When this is going to happen, I'm not in a position to specific – to put it
in a specific quarter. But, let's say, next two quarters, four quarters, so probably in this range you should see
some of this. You also saw some US and UK, somehow in the quarter, no material releases, but we are now, if
you look at the numbers [indiscernible] (00:51:18) in UK the same where the situation is more clear than
[indiscernible] (00:51:28) so advanced in the recovery. José?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. With regards to the regulatory expectations, yeah, so we initially expected maybe 40 basis points to 45
basis points, maybe now it's 10 basis points higher. Most of the increase from where we are today will happen in
the third quarter. But even if we front-load the transaction we have announced and with these regulatory impacts,
we are very, very confident we will be at the upper end of our target range this year in 2021. So we don't see a
problem there. Thank you, Andrea.

Ignacio Ulargui Q
Analyst, Exane BNP Paribas
Thanks very much for taking the questions. Good morning, all. Just have two questions on the P&L on operating
trends. I mean, one on costs. I mean, when we will start to see sort of like the benefits from the UK, you flagged
that second half should be better, but I think that costs have been a bit weaker than what we expect, what I
expected at least in the UK. Also, on the Digital Consumer Bank on the cost side, there has been a bit of an
increase in the quarter. Wanted just to get a bit of color of whether it's sort of like the consumer finance business
or Openbank, what is bringing costs up in the Digital Consumer Bank? The second question is on NII in Brazil. I

mean, it has been very strong in the quarter. Next quarter mechanically should be strong as well because of the
FX appreciation. But I mean, just if you could update a bit on what are you focusing in terms of loan growth and
what would be the margin impact in 3Q because of the hike in rates. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Let me collaborate, you asked specifically at your question about UK cost. Well, I said in the presentation
that we expect an acceleration of cost reduction in UK on the back of transformation we are having in the bank.
And we remain committed with the target in Europe for the four main units, Spain, UK, Poland and Portugal to
reach €1 billion. So UK will accelerate and within that we will reach our targets in the transformation plan. We
already reached the agreement [indiscernible] (00:54:00), so this is a question of time that it will come.
On the Digital Consumer Bank, digitization is a bit more complex here, because what you have in the numbers is,
this is a growing business, and as we reach new agreements with OEMs that span our business, and we span our
activity particularly in the leasing space, we are more focusing, being more efficient in transaction costs, the costs
compared with our revenues, not that much in an absolute number because that goes down. You should look at
Digital Consumer Bank growth story. And we naturally in the first half, we have had the first, I would say, four, five
months where we were lagging behind our – the normal originations.
In June, we got very close to the origination we expect in a normal month, and for the second half of the year we
think that we're going to have some – on the back of availability of cars, there's no new cars for sales in the
market due to scarcity of chips. And probably we – although I am optimistic that we'll reach normalized levels, this
is going to mean a break. On the other side, in used cars, we are doing significantly better, particularly our
position in Germany in used cars is doing much better. But overall, when you look at the Digital Consumer Bank,
the cost side, you should look in relation with the business we underwrite that we expect to grow significantly. And
we are growing, we are reaching new agreements with new OEMs that help us to grow the business all across.
And the fourth question was about NII in Brazil. José mentioned when he was presenting Brazil that we expect
the same trends in the second half. If you look at Brazil, well, you mentioned the interest rates, interest rates in
Brazil have not so significant impact. So some impact, positive impact on the liability side, not as big as in other
jurisdictions due to the fact that the mandatory reserve requirement limited the impact. And the loan book margin
spread has remained relatively flat, so in the last, I don't know, couple of quarters. So I do expect to keep growing
on the back of loan growth and on the back of market share gains. We keep gaining market share in the country.
So we are growing faster than our competitors and I do expect to keep growing. So I don't expect a big deal
compared with the current trends in NII in Brazil.

mentioned the €1 billion revenue target over the medium term. Can you give us a bit more color on what you

mean by medium term, and maybe also when you consider the business to be breakeven in terms of profits? The
second question will be on legal issues. What is your scenario for the Polish FX mortgages now, you've taken
another provision in the quarter, but where do you see here the endgame? And maybe also you can comment on
whether there's any impact on the business in Germany from the BGH ruling on deposit fees or whether you
expect that to have any read across for other geographies at some point? And then clarification just on the macro
provisions. Could you give us an update as to where they are now, after the releases in the UK and US? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Yes. I didn't get the third question in relation with Germany. What's your comment? Sorry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Britta Schmidt Q
Analyst, Bernstein Autonomous LLP
There was a ruling on reimbursing customers for increasing deposit fees without their explicit consent. I was just
wondering whether Santander is impacted by that or whether you expect that this margin will spillover to other
geographies where [ph] lawyers (00:58:24) will start to launch some cases on deposit fees.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Good. Thank you. So PagoNxt, more color. Well, this is, as we said in the presentation, that we expect to
grow revenues 50% in second half of the year compared with the first half. Remember that we acquired Wirecard
assets, and those assets – well, we have in our P&L because of running Wirecard's [indiscernible] (00:58:51) €60
million or something like that, the cost that we have, and revenue-wise we started just one month ago. That's the
reason why we expect to grow very rapidly our revenue base in the coming quarters without changing significantly
the cost base. When the breakeven is going to be – you see, €1 billion medium term, medium term normally we
double revenues, if we increase revenues 50% in second half, we should reach in the next two, three years a
volume of revenues in line with the number we are mentioning.
On the breakeven, well, I do have a – I will say the acquiring business is going to be big very quickly, they trade
very quickly. Well, I do expect probably no more than one year, one year-and-a-half. So in Latin America the
business is already more than breakeven. In Europe, we need to deploy our network in countries like UK and
Poland. That is going to take for a while and significant investments probably takes longer in this. In trade, well,
we are developing also the network, but this is a pretty straightforward business, and relatively is not – I don't
have a specific timeframe in mind, but is not very long period of time. Yeah. So probably IR can elaborate more
on this specifically with the specific details about timing, some plans that we have in relation with this business.
Swiss francs in Poland, we are expecting the Supreme Court ruling by September.

15% of the €2 billion portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Of the €2 billion portfolio. Well, highly uncertain the outcome of the ruling, and we will see. But in any case, take
into account that is we have, we own 70% of the bank. We don't expect a material impact for the group out of this
issue. The German ruling on deposits, we're not sharing deposits in Germany. You say all this goes to other
geographies. We are charging for deposits only institutional money and non-operational deposits of very large
corporates. So it's not a significant impact to us unless this affect the professional market, in which case, well, it
will go one side and another. So we have the two sides there. And to be honest with you, I don't know the net of
the two sides there. Do you know?

José Antonio García Cantera A

Carlos Peixoto Q
Analyst, CaixaBank
Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So I would perhaps start a bit or pick up a bit on the
questions regarding the evolution of cost of risk in the UK and in the US as well. So you witnessed here this write-
backs which I believe has to do with the adjustments on the macro inputs on the provisioning model. I was
wondering, going forward what type of underlying costs of risk should we expect on these two business lines?
And also on the NII front in the UK, if you could share some guidance on what to expect throughout the year and
possibly for next year. Thank you very much.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2021
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Underlying cost of risk in UK, US, traditionally, in UK where the majority of this mortgage business is 90%
of the volume, somehow that. So the cost of risk should be in the region – you look backwards and the cost of risk
should be in the region of 10 basis points, 15 basis points, has been the number that we have had for this. So
very low cost of risk. In US, it's quite different, on the back of the subprime business, we ran out of SCUSA,
assuming that the mix remains the same, you should expect a cost of risk in the subprime business was more in
the region of – SCUSA in the region of 6% or something like that, was in more with some volatility. Remember
that this business has seasonality. Look at the cost of risk in one year. If you look quarter-on-quarter, you have
significant seasonality. You look backwards, you have this, but 6% is the cost of risk in the consumer business.
And the other is fairly low, the remaining is fairly low, probably maybe in the 20 basis points to 30 basis points, the
business that is not consumer. So it depends, but largely on the mix. And NII guidance in UK was the other
question, José already elaborate on this. So what you are seeing now is the result of repricing liabilities. Well,
probably almost all has been done there, and the increasing spread in mortgages. Well, as you know, last year
and in the first half of this year has been fairly good. The mortgage market in UK is very dynamic. In the last
couple of weeks we see more competition in the market. But we remain partly constructive on the back of high
volumes and relatively stable mortgage spreads that comes and goes. But we do not expect that we can
[indiscernible] (01:05:07).

José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
If I may, as I mentioned, first half against first half of last year, net interest margin is up 26 basis points. So we
would expect to see a similar year-on-year figure for the full year, maybe 20 basis points to 25 basis points. We
have a sensitivity of around £17 million, £18 million to the basis point, and that is what explains our expectations
for double-digit growth in NII in the UK this year.

Benjamin Toms Q
Analyst, RBC Europe Ltd.
Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just one from me, please. Santander has been involved in a
branch trial in the UK where a number of banks have come together to form a bank hub in one branch. Do you
see this as a strategy that could get rolled out across rural areas in the UK? It seems like quite a good idea.
Thank you.

José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. The branch model is largely idiosyncratic, yeah, so depends on the different countries. The model in the
UK, where, as you know, we had a – the IFAs play a very big role in the mortgage market, you see a model that
is, I would say, is different from other countries, particularly in our wall, where we are, in other countries, more

kind of – the branch is kind of a supermarket, while in UK, is more specialized in specific segments in which we
work, particularly on the savings space and mortgage space. And we have the regional centers for corporate.
So it's a business that – it's a model that is, branches is on one side, for the retail, specializing in savings and
mortgages; and on the other side, the regional centers for corporates. This is a model that in our jurisdiction is
probably quite unique, yeah? So we have – we tend to have more – the branches tend to be higher, broader set
of products in the mortgages in the branches than the ones we have in UK, given our relative specialization in UK.
And we continue – we think that the branch distribution – the physical distribution in the UK is about to be growing
now with the current presence, and we are investing a lot in improving our digital distribution in all the subset, on
all the products in which we operate in the market, particularly in those who are more related with fee income, like
insurance and wealth management and these type of products that we are investing to improve our offer.

Carlos Cobo Catena Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (Spain)
Hi. This is Carlos from Société. Most of my questions are already been addressed. So if I may, just a quick follow-
up on capital and regulatory impacts. Once you've reached this reported capital ratio north of 12%, which is south
of that net of the fully-loaded impact, you seems to have stopped accruing capital. You started to engage in bolt-
on acquisitions.
So at which level of the fully loaded ratio of 11.7%, you will feel uncomfortable for the time being while the
pandemic has not fully recovered, so at which level you would be comfortable with the CET1 ratio fully loaded? Is
it 11.7% as we are now. Just [indiscernible] (01:09:10) that, that could be drifting lower in following quarters and
that would have made you again comfortable with that.
And if you could just clarify on the remaining – I'm sorry, I missed this discussion because of some problems. The
second half remaining regulatory impact and any other potential drivers in 2022/2023 that you would need to
offset with retained earnings? That would be helpful. Thank you.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2021
Yes, I can. Yeah. Go on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos Cobo Catena Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (Spain)
Well, so to summarize, if you – could you specify other upcoming regulatory impact from capital for the second
half on 2022/2023? And what level of fully loaded capital ratio would be uncomfortable for you as leaders of the
bank while the pandemic has not fully recovered? So I know that the former target is 11%, 12% and you're
comfortable in those levels. But while we still have concerns on the economic recovery, what would be the capital
level where you would be taking actions? So is it 11% a floor or you will be still seeing some volatility around
those levels and even lower? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Well, [indiscernible] (01:10:53-01:11:01) we are not inside our target and we try to come back to our target as
soon as we can, yeah? So that's simple. Well, I will focus much more on the likelihood of deploying capital at
Santander, yeah? So when you look at the preprovision profit, well, this is well-established in the stress test, all
the stress test. The likelihood of deploying a significant amount of capital at Santander is much lower than in our –
some of our competitors. That's the reason why in this stress test we always tend to come at the top due to the
less capital depletion than our peers. This make us comfortable with our range, yeah?
So when we define our range, we took into account the business mix that we have, our preprovision profit as the
first line of defense that may – that allow us to face the potential shock that may come from the business as the
ones that came last year in the middle of the pandemia. And, well, we feel comfortable with it. The range is the
result of our assessment where we feel comfortable 11% to 12%. Where we don't feel comfortable is below the
range.
And José.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
I would add to that, that, again, we have a management buffer in the region of 200 basis points. So we are not
only – not only we generate a lot of capital, but we are very comfortably above the minimum capital requirements.
And obviously, the regulators feel very, very comfortable with our 11% to 12% range. And I have already got into
details of what we expect for the second half or for the coming years. I mean, I think, it's very early. The ECB, as
you know, will let us know in September/October what their inspection and model exercises are for the coming
years. But now, we will update you when we have a bit more detail.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2021
Mario Ropero Q
Analyst, BESTINVER
Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of follow-ups. The first one is on cost. I know that Portugal and Poland represent
a little of the cost-cutting plan, but we have seen very little coming from there in the first half. So the question is
basically if you also expect savings to rise significantly in these two geographies in the second half?
And then the second question, considering the ongoing asset quality trends in Brazil, if you could confirm that you
expect cost of risk to remain below 4%, not just in the second half, I would be curious if you could give some
views about 2022. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
In relation with the cost evolution in both, in the – in Portugal and Poland, we – for sure, we're going to have a
acceleration of cost reduction in Portugal. In Poland, we have mixed trends. We are doing a large transformation
plan, but the salaries in Poland, as you know, are growing at the region of 6%, 7%. So it's more difficult to reduce
in nominal terms, although we're going to have a – we expect to improve our cost to income in the country.
Nominal reductions in Portugal, for sure, acceleration there. In Poland, largely depends on the situation in the
country. Where the salaries are growing, we're going to continue with the transformation plan. But the efforts have
been offset by the increase in salaries in the country, yeah?
And second, Brazil, the cost of risk. We are running 3.60% or something like that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
3-5, 3.5%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
3.5%. Well, in the coming quarters, we don't expect a material deviation from this other than the ones that may
come from the mix, yeah? So on a like-for-like basis, I don't expect they will deviate. It's true that we are growing
faster now in retail than we are growing in corporates and CIB. And this continue may go up, but this is – this will
be good news, I will say, in the sense that the retail business is highly profitable at this stage in Brazil, but
depends on the mix, yeah?
If you ask me, with the current mix, I don't expect big deals other than 10, 20 basis points up and down in Brazil.
The current scenario where the country is going to grow this year based on IMF yesterday is 5% and next year
2% or 3%. On the back of this, I don't expect a [indiscernible] (01:15:50) there. And probably they'll continue to
increase rates, yeah?

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 28-Jul-2021
Thank you, Mario. We have time for one final question, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: In this case, our last question is coming from Francisco Riquel from Alantra. Please proceed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Francisco Riquel Q
Analyst, Alantra Equities Sociedad de Valores SA
Yes. Thank you. Very briefly, in NII in Spain, a bit weaker than I was expecting, down quarter-on-quarter. So I
wonder if you may comment on that on the trends. And I feel that the mid-single digit growth guidance for the year
may look challenging. And if you can update also on the guidance in NII in Spain?
And then second question on Brazil, if you can comment on the changes in management and any potential
implications we should expect? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio Álvarez Álvarez A
Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. In Spain, NII, we'll guide you to 3%, 5% and that's around this. So probably we are – well, probably the
negative TAMs going lower, repricing rates in mortgages is the only thing that comes to my mind. The rest
remains basically in line with our expectation. Probably this effect may change 1% more or less, but not a material
change there on the trend.
And we are seeing bigger activity in mortgages that tend to be lower yields, and relatively low activity on the SME
and corporate space and tend to have higher yields. Other than that, I don't see a significant change in that,
yeah?
In Brazil, relation with the change of management. Well, we did a succession plan. I would say, business as
usual. Sérgio will become the non-Executive Chairman in January and two members of the COMEX, the
executive committee in Brazil, become in the case of Mario Leão will become the CEO of Brazil, and in the case
of Carlos Rey, is going to head the Latin American region. While it's a, I would say, now, it's business as usual, I
would say, nothing specific in relation with the strategy and all these things. Our plans is to keep growing in Brazil.
As you know, the subsidiary has had a outstanding performance and also the region is having an outstanding
peformance. Chile is having a great year. And we are growing nicely in other small franchises, like Uruguay, Peru,
Colombia and in the region. So we plan to keep growing in the region to expand in some regional business
across, like the consumer finance, the ones in PagoNxt acquiring on the others, Superdigital in consumer in the
area of PagoNxt.
And Carlos is going to have this mandate and Mario Leão is going to keep the mandate of keep growing in Brazil
and gaining market share as we've been doing with an outstanding returns, north of 20%, that we – probably we
are now among the largest bank in Brazil, the most profitable one. And this – naturally, we want this to continue
into the future.
