Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our earnings call, Joining me today are Vince Calabrese, Chief
Financial Officer; and Gary Guerrieri, Chief Credit Officer. On today's call, I will provide an overview of second
quarter result and update you on F.N.B.'s participation in the Paycheck Protection Program. Gary will discuss the

work together to emerge even stronger and united in our demand for a more successful future for all of our
constituents.

improved to $130 million. Core revenue trends remained solid throughout a challenging interest rate environment
with total revenues increasing 6% annualized to $306 million, and total assets growing nearly $3 billion to end
June at $38 billion.
Compared to the first quarter, loans and deposits increased $2.3 billion and $3.6 billion, or 10% and 15%,
respectively. On a linked-quarter basis, double-digit second quarter loan and deposit growth were supported by
organic commercial production and originating nearly 20,000 PPP loans totaling $2.6 billion.
Our fee-based businesses performed exceptionally well with capital markets and mortgage banking establishing
revenue records of $13 million and $17 million, respectively. Our efficiency ratio was 53.7% and operating
expenses were well controlled, down 3% from the first quarter. Even though there has been disruption across our
footprint due to COVID-19, we've still seen good commercial loan origination activity across most of the footprint.
This is a testament to our teams who continue to serve our clients and meet their borrowing needs while dealing
with a challenging operating environment.
The strength in our balance sheet and ample liquidity enables F.N.B. to support our clients' capital needs. We
continue to apply our consistent underwriting standard aligned with our strategy and overall risk profile as we
evaluate business opportunities in the current climate.
On a linked-quarter basis, total average loans increased 9%, largely driven by growth in commercial loans of
14%. Commercial line balances, when compared to historical level, contracted as we saw much lower line
utilization of 36%. The utilization rate decreased as PPP funds were utilized to support working capital needs by
many existing clients and economic activity declined during the period.
Commercial loan balances were also impacted by large corporate borrowers paying down bank credit facilities
with increased liquidity in the bond market. Average deposits increased 11% as we had solid organic growth in
customer relationships. A large inflow of deposits for PPP funding and government stimulus activities also
occurred.
As part of our business strategy, we have been focused on reducing the level of wholesale borrowings by
continuing to gain depositors and expand existing relationships. As a result, we were able to fully eliminate our
overnight borrowing position, replacing it with customer deposits. Noninterest-bearing deposits were up $2.1
billion or 33% from prior quarter-end.
Looking at June 30 spot balances, our loan-to-deposit ratio was 92%, including the funded PPP loans, which
positions us more favorably in the current rate environment. Growing noninterest-bearing deposits has been an
integral part of our long-term strategy and we've consistently been able to grow organically through various
interest rate environments, further strengthening our overall funding mix.
In fact, transaction deposits have increased $4 billion or 20% from March 31 and now represent 85% of total
deposits, which compares very favorably to 79% five years ago. With the Fed taking near-term rate increases off
the table, there is opportunity to offset net interest income headwind by continuing to reduce deposit costs.
As we have stated previously, continuing to grow our fee-based businesses is essential to diversifying our
revenue sources and to mitigate pressure on net interest income in an extended low-rate environment. With
interest rate expectations now reflecting lower for longer, it is important we continue to build on our recent
success in capital markets, mortgage banking, wealth management and insurance.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
This quarter's record mortgage banking income of $17 million better reflects the fundamentals to the results
without MSR impairment as the mortgage banking business set a new production record for the quarter of $869
million.
Turning to our participation in the Paycheck Protection Program, I would first like to recognize our teams for their
support of our customers and community throughout these extraordinary circumstances. Our employees have
worked tirelessly to ensure businesses receive critical funding during a time when regions within our footprint
experienced extended shutdown, particularly in our metro markets in Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic, and
when many borrowers turned from larger banks to F.N.B. to accommodate their needs.
As part of the PPP origination process, each borrower opened an F.N.B. account, which supports our efforts to
bring in new households. Looking ahead, we are optimistic that borrowers will be able to deploy these funds as
businesses around the footprint reopen.
As an organization, we leveraged our technology infrastructure and expertise already in place to quickly adapt
and accommodate our customers in a challenging remote environment. Coupled with significant financial aids and
employee volunteerism in our communities, our efforts have helped tens of thousands of small businesses during
the pandemic and supported the retention of hundreds of thousands of jobs.
From the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, F.N.B. has upheld consistent volumes of total transactions through
other transactions by providing customers with a seamless transition from physical to online and mobile
engagement. This was made possible from the significant investment we've committed to our digital and online
platforms over the last decade. In fact, the appointment setting feature on our new website that went live in
January enabled F.N.B. to continue serving clients safely in our branches throughout the crisis.
We grew from 26 monthly appointments in January to 2,700 appointments in April. The rapid shift to remote
services accelerated the enhancements to our digital strategy that were already underway and minimize
disruption for our customers. As the operating environment remains in a constant state of change, we will
continue our innovative approach to better serve our customers.
I will now share some updates regarding our operations and delivery channels. Together with the uptick in online
appointment setting, our website increased traffic by millions of daily visitors. As we are deepening relationships
with customers throughout our digital capabilities, we are also generating significant opportunities.
By synchronizing the physical and digital customer experience, we can take customers who utilize a single
product and broaden the relationship to good products such as savings, credit card, private banking, mortgage,
wealth management and insurance. At the end of the day, it provides tremendous value to the customers who
have multiple product relationships within F.N.B. on a single platform connected through digital capabilities.
Overall, the acceleration of digital and remote banking volume demonstrates our versatile and integrated
multichannel strategy.
Customers have been more active in F.N.B.'s mobile and online channels with monthly average users up by
50,000 in both categories compared to the average for 2019. While our customer adoption rates for online and
mobile have accelerated, our customers have still expressed a strong desire to conduct business within our
branches.
As an essential business, it is important for F.N.B. to remain available and accessible. Our business continuity
team in collaboration with other units, including data science, human resources and retail banking, developed a

monitoring system in which we can evaluate data related to the healthcare crisis on a locational basis. On July 13,
2020, we reopened the majority of our branch lobbies to customers, adhering to the most stringent safety
measures, including social distancing and cleaning protocols, as we begin to move forward to the next phase of
operation.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary to cover asset quality.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. During the second quarter, our credit portfolio continued to
perform in a satisfactory manner as the COVID-19 global pandemic continues to evolve. Our credit metrics have
held ground in this challenging economic environment, which I will cover with you in greater detail on both a
GAAP as well as a non-GAAP basis exclusive of our loan volume funded under the PPP program. I will also
provide some updates on the status of our loan deferrals and the steps we are taking to manage our book,
particularly those borrowers tied to COVID-sensitive industries.
Let's now review the quarterly results. The level of delinquency ended the second quarter at 92 basis points on a
GAAP basis, down 21 bps over the prior quarter as early-stage delinquencies returns to more normalized levels.
When excluding PPP loan volume, the level of delinquency would have ended the quarter at 1.02%, down 11 bps
from the prior quarter.
The level of NPLs and OREO totaled 72 basis points at June, an 8-basis-point increase linked-quarter, while the
non-GAAP level was 80 bps excluding PPP. The migration was due primarily to a few previously rated credits that
were further impacted by the current COVID environment that we proactively moved to non-accrual during the
quarter. Of our total NPLs at June, 48% of these borrowers continued to pay as agreed and are current.
Net charge-offs remained at a good level at $8.5 million for the quarter or 13 basis points annualized, resulting in
a year-to-date level of 12 basis points. Provision expense totaled $30 million in the quarter, which includes
additional build for macroeconomic conditions prior to COVID-19. Inclusive of the Q1 economic-driven build, our
COVID-related provision for the first half of the year totaled $55 million.
Our ending reserve stands at 1.4%; and excluding PPP volume, the non-GAAP ending ACL totals 1.54%,
representing a 10 basis point increase over the prior quarter, resulting in NPL coverage of 215%. When including
the acquired unamortized loan discounts, our coverage excluding PPP volume is 1.87%. Under the preliminary
severely adverse DFAST scenario, the current reserve position inclusive of unamortized loan discounts would
cover 78% of stressed losses.
As the pandemic continues to pressure the global economy, our approach to managing the book in this COVID
environment remains in line with what I communicated on last quarter's call. We continue to conduct thorough
borrower level reviews within our commercial book to track key performance indicators for those that operate in
economically sensitive industries where they have otherwise been impacted by the pandemic. These ongoing
targeted portfolio reviews allow our credit teams to quickly identify and proactively address emerging risks at the
borrower, industry, or overall portfolio level. Additionally, we continue to conduct a series of scenario analysis and
stress test models under our existing allowance and DFAST frameworks as we work through this challenging
environment.
As it relates to our borrowers requesting payment deferral, 10% of our loan portfolio, excluding PPP loans, were
approved during the initial deferment request window. Of these deferments, 98.4% were current and in good

standing prior to the pandemic. Of the remaining $39 million, $12 million is already on non-accrual. A request for
initial deferrals are essentially non-existent and we have only seen a small amount of second request for payment
deferral at this time.
That said, we are carefully monitoring our credit portfolio and remain vigilant to identify borrowers that could face
further pressure during uncertain economic conditions. This approach allows us to quickly identify and manage
risk in the portfolio while still meeting the credit needs of our customers.
The composition of the portfolio remains diverse and well-balanced across several product lines, geographies,
and industries. As shown on slide 10, our exposure to highly sensitive industries remains low at 3.8% of the total
portfolio, which includes all borrowers operating in the travel and leisure, food services, and energy space. And
the level of payment deferrals granted to these borrowers remains at 38%. Additionally, we have been tracking
our retail secured IRE portfolio closely to assess the emerging challenges on this asset class as well as the
nature of the tenants' operations and insulation from certain economic strain as essential businesses. Our
weighted average LTV position in this book remains strong at 65%.
In summary, we continue to manage our credit portfolio through this difficult economic environment by drawing on
our strong credit fundamentals and our risk management strategies which we continue to enhance as the COVID
situation plays out. Considering these challenges, our portfolio is in a satisfactory position entering the second
half of the year. Realizing the uncertainty of the economic environment as we look ahead, we continue to draw on
the strength of our experienced banking teams to manage through this environment as we move into the latter
half of the year. I would like to recognize our teams for their tireless efforts as we continue to work through this
challenging environment.
I will now turn the call over to Vincent Calabrese, our Chief Financial Officer, for his remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thanks, Gary. Good morning. Today, I will review the second-quarter results and trends in our operating
environment and then discuss our capital management approach and current position. I'll note that our tangible
common equity levels entered the year at the strongest position we've had in nearly two decades, and we are
comfortable with our current capital position.
Looking at slide 5, GAAP EPS for the second quarter is $0.25 including $0.05 related to significant or outsized
items. These included $17.1 million of COVID-19 reserve bill and $2 million of COVID-19 related expenses. The
TCE ratio ended June at 6.97%, reflecting these items as well as a 52-basis-point temporary impact for the $2.5
billion in net PPP loan balances at June 30. Without the PPP balances, the TCE ratio would have been 7.49%.
Additionally, our CET1 estimate ended the quarter at 9.4% compared to 9.1% at March 31 and 9.4% at the end of
2019, as PPP loans carry a zero percent risk weighting for risk-based capital purposes.
Pre-tax pre-provision earnings increased to $130 million providing more than adequate earnings power as we
declared our third quarter dividend at $0.12 cents earlier this week. With a dividend payout ratio of 48% in the
second quarter, we are well below historical levels of previous payout ratios. I'll touch on our capital management
approach in more detail later in my comments.
Turning to the balance sheet on slide 14, a key theme is the impact of $2.5 billion in net PPP loan. As high as
9.5% of total loans and leases at June 30. PPP was the primary driver in the linked-quarter average increase of
$2.1 billion or 9%, as well as strong organic activity across most of the commercial footprint.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
Our commercial line utilization ended June at 36%, below historical levels down from the mid-40's spot utilization
rates at the end of the first quarter as we clearly saw some customer borrowing activity shift over to the PPP at
our large corporate borrowers' access to capital markets to reduce their bank debt. Average consumer loans were
essentially flat with direct installment loans increased $65 million or 14% annualized and residential mortgage
increased 6% annualized, two bright spots that continue to perform well. The increases in direct installment and
mortgage loans were offset by continued declines in direct auto loans and consumer lines, two loan classes
heavily affected by the pandemic.
Continuing down to slide 14, average deposit increased $2.7 billion or 11% on a late quarter basis led by $2.9
billion or 15% in transaction deposit growth. Transaction deposits equaled 85% of total deposits. As our managed
decline in CDs continued, transaction deposit balance has benefited from stimulus programs, and PPP customer-
driven inflows. Non-interest bearing, interest-bearing demand, and savings account balances each increased
significantly, up $1.8 billion, $854 million, and $226 million respectively.
Now focusing on the income statement on slide 15. Compared to the first quarter, net interest income totaled
$228 million, a decrease of $4.7 million or 2%, as loan and deposit growth mostly offset the impact from lower
rates. The net interest margin narrowed 26 basis points to 288 basis points primarily driven by a full-quarter
impact to March action, to lower the target set funds range to 0 to 25 basis points. Additionally, average one-
month LIBOR fell to 36 basis points from 141 basis points in the prior quarter.
Total yield on average earning assets declined 58 basis points to 354 basis points, reflecting lower yield on
variable and adjustable rate loans due to the lower interest environment and the impact of the PPP balances.
Total cost of funds decreased to 67 basis points from 101 basis points as costs and interest-bearing deposits
were reduced 37 basis points.
Slide 16 and 17 provide details for non-interest income and expense compared to the first quarter. Non-interest
income totaled $77.6 million, increasing $9.1 million or 13.3% as mortgage banking operations increased $17.6
million on a reported basis or $10.2 million excluding MSR impairments of $300,000 and $7.7 million respectively.
Mortgage production established a new quarterly record at $869 million, increasing $306 million or 55% from the
prior quarter with large contributions from North Carolina and the mid-Atlantic region. Capital markets also set a
new record of $12.5 million increasing $1.4 million or 12.6% with strong contributions from interest rate derivative
activity across the footprint. As expected, service charges decreased $6.2 million or 20.5% due to noticeably
lower transaction volumes in the COVID-19 environment.
Turning to slide 17, non-interest expense totaled $175.9 million, a decrease of $19 million or 9.7%, including $2
million of expenses associated with COVID-19 in the second quarter 2020, $15.9 million of outsized, unusual or
significant expenses occurring in the first quarter.
On an operating basis, expenses declined $5.1 million or 2.9% compared to the first quarter of 2020, as we have
realized lower variable expenses such as travel and business development and increased FAS 91 benefits given
the amount of loans originated in the second quarter.
Additionally, we recognized an impairment of $4.1 million from a second quarter renewable energy investment tax
credit transaction. The related tax credits were recognized during the quarter as a benefit to income tax. Efficiency
ratio improved significantly, 53.7% compared to 59%.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
Referring to recent trends on slide 18, we continue to observe daily changes in external factors including multiple
aspects of potential economic recovery, changes in government programs, and regulation changes over current
programs. Saying that, we are providing our current directional outlook for the third quarter, based on what we
know today, which is subject to change as we all know.
We expect period-end loans to increase low-single-digits from June 30 assuming no forgiveness of PPP loans
given the SBA's current expected time for processing forgiveness applications. While we expect deposits to
decline from second quarter 2020 levels based on an expectation that customers increase the deployment of
funds received through the government programs, we do expect to see continued organic growth in transaction
deposits.
We expect third quarter net interest income to reflect the full impact of lower one-month LIBOR rates and variable
rate loans partially offset by a full quarter benefit of higher commercial loan balances, continued reductions in the
cost of interest-bearing deposits. We expect positive trends in capital markets and mortgage banking, although
lower than the record levels this quarter. We expect service charges to increase if recent transaction volume
trends continue. We expect expenses to be stable, up slightly from the second quarter. Lastly, we expect the
effective tax rate to be around 17% for the full-year 2020.
For the remainder of my comments, I would like to discuss our risk-based capital position and overall
management philosophy given the current environment beginning on slide 20. Continue to be very comfortable
with our capital ratios as they stand today with the benefit of entering this crisis from a position of strength. As
demonstrated in the new capital slides we have added to the deck, we have ample internal capital generation
cushions for all of our capital ratios in relation to well-capitalized thresholds.
For example, for the total risk-based capital ratio to fall below 11%, total capital would have to drop by $258
million, 7.9% of total capital of $3.3 billion. Our risk-weighted assets would have to increase by $2.3 billion, which
is 8.5% of total risk-weighted assets of $27.5 billion. I could comment also that $258 million is in after-tax dollars.
On top of our capital position, we have a conservative bias in how we build reserves especially given the
consistent underwriting philosophy has been in place for well over a decade. With CET1 of $2.6 billion and an
allowance for credit losses of $365 million and a remaining PCD discount of $77 million, we have a substantial
base available to absorb credit losses. Put that in context, our reserves plus remaining discount on previously
acquired loans would cover 62 quarters of net charge-offs that averaged $7.1 million per quarter in the first half
2020. This is before considering the $2.6 billion in CET1.
Another way to look at this is relative to severely adverse charge-offs in our last stress test. Again, using $442
million in reserves plus remaining discount, we covered 75% of $586 million in charge-offs projected under the
severely adverse scenario for a nine-quarter period. When you put the $586 million in context, that compares to
$64 million over nine quarters using the first half of 2020 net charge-offs or 9.2 times the current levels.
As far as dividend sustainability, we are governed by the Federal Reserve and OCC. From a Fed perspective, we
currently pay out $39 million in common dividends and $2 million in deferred dividend for a total of $41 million per
quarter. The Fed four-quarter test currently shows an excess of $153 million after paying out the third quarter
dividend just declared.
From an OCC perspective, there are significant cushions to support the $46 million the bank is projected to pay
up to the holding company. Three-part test shows a cushion of $913 million relative to undivided profit, $517

million relative to net profits for the current year, combined with retained net profits for the first two years.
Cushions are both well-capitalized levels ranging from 228 basis points to 384 basis points.
In addition to looking at our capital position, it's important to consider PPNR generation. Year-to-date PPNR of
$236 million more than supports the incremental reserve bill to the first six months of the year. We generated
ample capital to cover the preferred and common dividend and our CET1 ratio was consistent with where we
ended 2019 at 9.4%.
Earlier this week, we announced our third quarter dividend of $0.12. Given the earnings level through the first half
of 2020, you can see there is capacity to continue to return capital to shareholders. Overall, our capital
management philosophy is grounded in a conservative and consistent underwriting and credit management
philosophy throughout varying economic cycles, supplemented with robust and comprehensive enterprise risk
management, including very active credit monitoring processes.
With that, I will turn the call back to Vince.

Vincent J. Delie, Jr.
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thanks, Vince. Looking at everything we've managed through over the last few months, the efforts of our team
has been nothing short of exceptional, with assisting our clients and communities in which we serve. Recent
events highlighting persistent inequities in our country have affirmed our important mandate to support those who
are vulnerable and traditionally underserved. As an organization, we continue to place a strong emphasis on
being inclusive and demonstrated by our recent $250 million commitment to address economic and social inequity
in low and moderate income and predominantly minority community.
As we continue to deploy these investments, our shareholders will benefit as we have continued to prudently
manage risk, liquidity, and capital action to better position our company. During the quarter, FNB originated nearly
$500 million in Paycheck Protection Program loans in low to moderate income and rural neighborhoods, assisting
thousands of small businesses and employees. Our success is a direct result of our banker's proactive outreach
to over 100 organizations and non-profit entities that work directly with these communities. This is just an example
of how committing our resources this way leads to good business results. I encourage everyone to learn more
about our ongoing initiatives and commitment to diversity and inclusion through the links contained on the slides
within today's presentation.
As we look ahead to move into the next phase of COVID-19 recovery, we will continue to focus our response on
four key pillars to meet the needs of each of our constituents. The pillars are: Employee protection and
assistance, operational response and preparedness, customer and community support, and risk management
and actions taken to preserve shareholder value, given the extreme challenges presented. Through these
unprecedented conditions, our employees have consistently delivered a superior experience for our customers.
In June, FNB was ranked among the best banks in Ohio and North Carolina by Forbes and AdvisoryHQ,
respectively, a testament to the consistency of our customer-centric culture across our footprint. The company
was again named the top workplace in Northeastern Ohio for the sixth consecutive year by the Cleveland Plain
Dealer. This recognition, which is based solely on employee feedback, joins the list of nearly 30-such awards
received over the past decade. All of this has been made possible by our dedicated employees.
In closing, I would again like to thank my fellow team members as they have demonstrated throughout this time
exactly why they continue to be our most valuable assets. Our dedication to cultivating superior culture directly

Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, the accretion was $13.2 million of the kind of remaining discount from CECL approach there and you may
remember that was $17 million in the first quarter. So, down a little bit but still a pretty good healthy level there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay, great. And then, Gary, on the credit quality front. So, the deferrals at 10% sounds like the new requests
have dramatically slowed. I believe you guys were on a three-month program. So, I mean, they should be either
extending or going back to normal. You know, what is sort of based on your indications and discussions, you
know what – how do you expect that to – that 10% to trend in the next quarter – this quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Hey, Casey. In reference to that, we did do 90 days and it really got active in mid- to late-April into May. June
flattened out significantly. There was very small numbers of activity in June. So, what we did, we had – a
significant number of our clients made the April payment. March was already made. They made the April payment
and we kind of shoved them further into the recovery. So, at this point, we've only seen about 50 commercial
requests for second deferrals and about 250 on the retail side.
So, at this point, it's been very light, and the bankers are working closely with those top clients and talking with
them on a regular basis. We do expect that to ramp up as we work through the rest of July and into August and
September a bit. But at this point, it's very light.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And so, do you expect those deferrals to stay at 10% when you guys report in October or do you expect a
lot of them to go back to normal?

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. We expect a lot of those deferrals to go back to normal payments and we'll report that going forward. As a
lot of those clients are not going to need a second deferral, it's going to be a significant number that were not
needed from our perspective at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay, great. And...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I think what you will see, you will see heavier deferrals for second requests coming in the hotel space and in that
restaurant space, as they have more pressure. The other item that I'll mention to you again is coming into the
situation using the end of the year, 98.4% of these clients who took the deferrals were in perfectly good standing.
So, it was a very small number as mentioned in my report that weren't working in the normal course of business.
Naturally, this shutdown has impacted a lot of clients, and a lot of clients were preserving liquidity and being
cautious. But, hopefully, that answers the question for you holistically.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yes. Yes. Thank you. And so on the reserve build, you guys had moderated this quarter. Just when did you –
what forecast, how late is the – how recent is the forecast that you used to build your reserve? And do you guys,
given that the reserve build moderated this quarter, do you feel like you've – and the deferrals you're getting
decent news there, do you feel like the reserve builds, the heavy lifting has been done or the – I know it's a tough
question to answer. It changes every day, but just given where deferrals are going and your lower reserve build, it
feels like you guys are – the heavy lifting is behind, so just some color there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. On the model first, let me address that one for you first. I mean, we continue to use a recessionary
scenario, Casey, released in mid-June with the average unemployment rate of 11% over the forecast horizon with
annualized year-over-year GDP not turning positive until the middle half of 2021. So it's a fairly good recessionary
scenario that we've used in the model.
As it relates to the second part of your question, with our focus and consistent view on our underwriting and our
credit culture around the desired asset classes that we want put into book and the position and mix of our
portfolio, I feel pretty confident that our book will generally outperform through the cycle as it did in the last. That
said, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as you've mentioned in the economy. At this point in the
economy – if the economy deteriorates further from here, the portfolio would experience higher levels of stress.
Given our position and the performance to-date, our portfolio mix, the smaller portfolios across higher asset
classes, we'll continue to assess the positions around it as the third quarter plays out.
Few additional comments here. Remember in Q1, we captured the March 27 forecast when others may not have.
So, we utilized that most recent bit of information around our forecasted models at that point. And during that first
half, we built totally $55 million now through the first six months.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
Also of note, we really essentially have no credit card, student loan and a very small energy portfolio. Those are
tough from the reserve standpoint during this environment as you all know. In addition, we had a pretty significant
decline in line utilization, indirect auto and some declines in the small business portfolio which really freed up
about $10 million in additional reserves during the quarter for us. So that helped as well.
And finally, when you're look at the of the macroeconomic environment and looking at it from a static position
moving forward, similar performance across our portfolio. We wouldn't expect much of any additional build from a
macroeconomic forecast perspective, and we'll continue to manage that accordingly, based on how the economy
evolves from here.

Excellent. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I would just add if you look at – and I think we commented on this, but the reserve coverage excluding the PPP
was $154 million. We have $77 million of remaining discount on the acquired loans that's left in the CECL
accounting. So, if you – that's available to absorb losses. So, the $154 million goes to $187 million and then as we
had in our slide, we had another $14 million in reserve for unfunded volumes, which is another 7 basis points or
so. So, there's a good amount that we've added to the reserves since the end of the year. Gary's point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q

Understood. And Vince, say just last one for me. The total capital ratio, I didn't see it in the release of the deck. It

Good morning.

Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Good morning, Frank.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Just on the – a follow-up on credit. As you guys point out, if you look at the reserve ratio with the – including the
acquired book it seems to hold up well versus where peers are. But, if I drill down into categories, at first glance, it
seems to be a bit a little bit thinner in some areas than I would have expected. So, I just wonder if you could give
maybe a little bit more detail or color around, for example, the retail CRE book where I think reserves are still just
under 1%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. When you look at that portfolio, Frank, we have displayed very few problem credits in that book. We feel
very good about our sponsors across that portfolio and we've really focused our underwriting in that book at
higher cash flow streams and required debt service coverage over the last few years due to the fact that some of
it is retail focused as we've thought. One of the things that we have in there is an extremely low level of
delinquency today, naturally. The situation is fluid, but the delinquency in that book is 60 basis points with very
low levels of any rated credit at this point. So, that book has been very nicely underwritten from our perspective.
And as mentioned in my earlier comments, the LTVs across that are right at 65%, so we're well-positioned in that
portfolio at this point. So, really feel good about it and working with those clients. What's happening at this point,
we are seeing rental streams start to increase as the economy has opened up. We'll continue to keep an eye on
that and – as we move forward, but hopefully, we'll continue to see positive momentum there as we are.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
And how are you guys approaching downgrades? Are deferrals pushing downgrades of credits to classified credit
size? Are the deferrals pushing that down the road or are you taking them as they come? And just wondering if
you feel like there could be – as these deferrals come off a migration there, that could drive further reserve
builds?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. During the first round, the credits that were in sensitive industries were generally moved a notch. Other
credits that were in a very strong position and were being conservative, those particular ones weren't moved.
During the second phase here, every second deferral will require a one-notch downgrade if not two, in most
instances, to a substandard rating. So, we'll continue to work that portfolio in that fashion and address those
ratings accordingly based on the risk present in each one of those credit situations.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Frank, I will tell you, in the commercial portfolio, I'll speak to the commercial portfolio here. I'm not sure if you're
crossing over to Consumer. But, there's very active management, risk rating reviews that go on perpetually. So,
there is a very aggressive management system in place to ensure that as we review financials and review credit
company compliance, that the appropriate risk rating is assigned to those credits.
So, the migration on risk rating, if that's what you're asking is going on now. I mean it's been going on. When
these deferrals come in, it may have been a little early, right, because the majority of the impact for our
commercial customers, based upon what I'm hearing, was happening in April late March into April and May, and
then they've kind of rebounded back, most of the industries have come back, well beyond where they were at the
depths of April. So, that's an ongoing process and we have a fairly rigorous process in place to review mis-
readings.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. Vince's point there, Frank, is a very good point. I mean, we're known from a regulatory standpoint, to be
very aggressive from a risk grading touch standpoint. Every – our focus is that every time a banker touches a
credit, no matter what it is, whether it's annual review time, whether it's line of credit renewal time, or whether it's a
phone call, we require them to assess the situation and downgrade risk on a month-to-month basis. So that
proactive approach, I think, has been in place for many years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Great. Thanks. And then just a quick one on expenses if I could. You guys gave some guide for what to expect in
the third quarter. Do you – is there – you know, if you could just give us a little bit of the puts and takes in terms of
getting there from this quarter? I know you had the tax credit would have increased expenses this quarter. So just
trying to get a sense of if I look at – if I take out the COVID-related expense, I guess I'm at like, I guess, at $174
million for the expense base in the quarter. So is that kind of where you're talking off of in terms of steady to
slightly up number and is that a good run rate maybe beyond 3Q, if you can give us any sense there? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Sure. Yeah. On the slide, we mentioned that we had the $4.1 million impairment and then going the other way,
because you didn't see much movement in that other non-interest expense line item. You know, we had lower
business development, we have OREOs, reported to OREO a lower miscellaneous losses and miscellaneous –
so they kind of net out. As you can see, it was 21.9% in the first quarter and 21.9% in the second quarter. So,
when you look forward to the third quarter, I mean, the comments that I made in my prepared remarks kind of the
mid-170s, I'd say kind of somewhere between $175 million, 177-ish or so. There's – that includes commissions on
mortgage activity, which has been very heavy. So, that comes through to that line item and you'll see some of that
come through in the third quarter.
So, I mean, it's really right around – you know, I think last quarter I used like a $178 million. I think we'd be south
to that. We came in at the $176 million kind of on a total basis, $174 million like you said. So, it's somewhere
around there, Frank. You know $175 million to $177 million, I kind of use as a run rate for the third quarter and in
the fourth quarter, we're not really giving any other direction there. But, there's nothing unusual on the horizon that
would hit that.

Good morning, Michael.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
A quick follow-up question to start just on credit. You know, on slide 9 you guys present kind of your historical
charge-off peak rate going back to the last crisis, which you obviously performed well through ex-Florida. Is that
kind of the right way to think about charge-offs this time around, Gary? Do you feel comfortable with that or do
you think that given kind of the severity and the shock that – and potential length of this crisis that could be worse
this time around?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
You know, I feel similarly confident, Michael, around how the portfolio will perform through a cycle such as this.
You know, when you look at our models, as we mentioned in terms of the stress testing that we're doing and all of
the models that we're running across the portfolio, and the build of $55 million during the first six months of the
year. If you would add that to normalized charge-offs, you're looking at charge-offs on an annualized basis in the
45-basis-point range or so at that stress level. And the models are confirming that. It feels to me quite good.
Naturally, the economy has to stabilize at some point. The volatility needs to move away. But at this point, it feels
good from that perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Okay. So, just to kind of put everything together, I mean, if we took a charge-off rate similar to that and then
assumed kind of the macro conditions have maybe stabilized in terms of the CECL allowance outlook, then you

would just be kind of accounting for downgrades and those charge-offs that we kind of already mentioned and
that's kind of how we should think about credit and provisioning going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I would say that's appropriate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And providing for growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Right. For growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Sure. Yeah. We're hoping for that, I think.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
We're hoping for growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Yeah. And then maybe switching gears Vince, just on the PPP loans and the fees associated with those, was
there any recognition of those fees on an accelerated amortization basis this quarter. And then what is your
outlook for that on a go-forward basis?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. No, I would say the forgiveness process hasn't started yet. The SBA is still working on how they're going to
receive forgiveness applications. So, kind of, we're ready for that once it comes, but it's not – they're not ready to
be able to start that process yet. So, the fee recognition that came in will be just kind of a normal accretion of the
fees over the – The vast majority of the loans are the two-year terms. We had a handful with the five years.
So, I guess, the one way to look at it is just the yields for the second quarter was 3.15% which is the coupon plus
the accretion of a portion of the fees. So, we don't have any acceleration that's coming in there yet. And you really
don't know. It's hard to predict. I mean, in our heads, we've been ticking around maybe you get 15% forgiveness
in Q4. You probably won't get any in the third quarter just because of they're not ready yet, so, and then, they
have 90 days to respond and it pushes it out into the fourth quarter.
So, I guess for like modeling purposes, we've been using 15% as an assumption in Q4. And then, maybe you get
three-quarters of it by the end of March and then, maybe 90% by the end of June, and then you have some tail.
And those are just reference points, like, well, nobody really knows. But we do expect to get some level of

F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
forgiveness that will happen in the fourth quarter. And then, depending on the magnitude, that pulls some of the
fees forward. So, those are kind of the key points there as far as the PPP balances.
And in the third quarter, I should just comment too, so the average balance was $1.9 billion, the average balance
in the third quarter will be kind of $2.5 billion net, is what we'll have because we didn't have all of it throughout the
second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
The other thing I'll say – This is Vince Delie. I'll put a pitch-in for our IT folks and Sam Kirsch in Digital Channels.
We've built out a fairly robust system for clients to upload the information to walk – that walks them through the
forgiveness process which keeps changing and is fairly sophisticated. But a very nice process. And then Gary
Guerrieri hired a team of people and has assembled a team that will focus on acting as liaisons for clients to help
facilitate the forgiveness process. So, we're still hoping for an easier process on those smaller loans that I know is
being kicked around for instantaneous forgiveness for $100 million to $150 million. That would help tremendously.
But we have systems in place to help facilitate forgiveness for our clients.
The only other thing I'll point out is when you look at the balances, our loan balances overall were, if you subtract
it out, the PPP loans would be down slightly. It was at 1%, I think, 1%, 1.5% overall. You know, it's kind of a hard
equation to do because we have smaller clients. If you look at the dispersion of deployment of those PPP loans,
the relative size of our loans are smaller. Typically those customers would borrow through the PPP program, pay
down the working capital facilities, right, because the great deferential is fairly significant. And then borrow back
on their lines when – if they have confidence that they're going to be able to do that.
So, I think, it's – when you look at the transfer from PPP to our own revolver balances or line balances of small
business customers, that explains some of the decline in the portfolio. The overall activity across the company, as
I mentioned in my prepared comments, was pretty good and there are still financeable enterprises out there.
There are entities that we would certainly consider providing credit, too, in other industries that are distressed and
we don't play significantly as you can see from the breakdown of the portfolio that we've provided in our
disclosures. We're not very active in a number of those areas.
So, I'm a little more optimistic about the activity moving forward. Of course, we haven't seen the fallout yet that will
happen I think from a credit perspective in the third and fourth quarter, but so far it looks okay for us. Anyway, I
thought I'd share that with you. Some additional commentary.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks. Thanks for that additional color, Vince. And then just maybe last one for me, just on the net
interest margin. It looks like you guys still have some room to bring down the deposit and funding costs from here.
Could you maybe just talk about the timing and opportunity with that and then if there's any kind of lingering roll
down in loan yields from this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, on the liability side, I mean I think if there's opportunity within the deposit base, I know – we've had
significant deposit growth even outside of the PPP, the growth related to PPP balances coming on. Our demand
deposits were up significantly and were trending up over the last few years. So, that has continued. I think there

are opportunities there to bring down our overall costs, and I'll let Vince talk about the asset side of the equation in
terms of margins. But on the liability side, there is room for us to continue to improve on that side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you. Just a couple of comments. So when you look at performance for the quarter, so net interest income
declined $4.7 million; given that we had a 105-basis-point reduction in one-month LIBOR, and [ph] 141 (01:01:05)
36 basis points, that's a $22-million reduction in interest income, an $8.5 billion. If you look at the net decline
given that $22.3 million, it's not a bad outcome there. And then as I mentioned in the beginning of the call,
[indiscernible] (01:01:26) accretion coming in a little bit lower from [ph] 17 to 13 (01:01:28), will have some
impacts just comparing the second quarter to the first quarter.
When you look at the – we had $2 billion growth in average earning assets, largely funded with $1.8 billion
noninterest-bearing deposits, and as Vince said, that's been a continuous growth. Obviously, it has additional
influx from the program, but we've been growing DDAs every year. So, when you look at the cost of the
interesting-bearing deposits as we had on the slide, we were able to bring that down 37 basis points to help
mitigate the impact on the LIBOR. So, we're able to offset a good chunk of that, which is a positive. If you look at
the kind of entry point into the third quarter, on a spot basis, the cost of interest-bearing deposits is 61 basis
points. The average for the quarter was 72 basis points. So, you have an 11-basis-point kind of head start going
into the third quarter, and there's still buckets of deposits that were – we've targeted and we're looking at and
continuing to expect to bring those rates down some more.
So, there's definitely some more impact there. I think as far as the asset side of it, I mean LIBOR is at 18 basis
points. So, it was down to 16 basis points, it's up a couple. We'll take a couple of basis points, but, I don't think
there's anything unusual that will come through kind of third quarter versus the second quarter just other than mix,
the mix of the loans that you put on. So, that's been really kind of beyond that and the spreads have kind of been
stable in the recent months.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Morning. So, just a question, I guess, on the reserve build. So, that $17 million of incremental build from the
macro forecast, Gary, is that just taking the model with the macro assumptions that you laid out and that's what's
flowing through or were there some qualitative overlays, some of those other items that you discussed that that
offset what the model would otherwise have spit out for the macroeconomic expectation for the reserve?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
No, it would include some overlays around our normal modeling process, Jared, so, yeah, it is inclusive of
overlays and qualitatives.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. I guess, if we see the macro model deteriorate in the third quarter, should we assume that there's
potentially some additional overlays that would offset just the pure impact of that move or, not necessarily?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
No, it's going to remain fluid. I mean, I can't speculate on what the situations now with the forward view is going to
be at that point. You know, based on where we are today, we feel good about the position of the portfolio. We'll
continue to keep an eye on it and manage it as the macroeconomic environment changes going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Vince D., earlier in your commentary, you had mentioned something about evaluating business
opportunities and as you go forward, can you give a little color on what that could look like?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I mean, we – there are certain areas, for example, we just booked a fairly large credit in the – believe it or
not, it's a developer that has tenants 99% occupied, $25-million-dollar deal that an insurance company was
looking to get out of retail exposure. The loan-to-value is 55%. The debt service covered is 2.2 times or greater.
So, there are transactions out there that you would do. The tenant base is largely large, investment-grade banks
there's four banks in our parcel on the property. So there are – and there's a grocery store that's very, solid, long
term lease. I mean, these are long term leases. There are opportunities to do business.
I mean, we're just going to have to be extraordinarily selective on what we go after. We also recently won a large
credit facility for a AA-rated higher education institution. So there's still activity going on, with billions of dollars in
reserves. So we're just going to have to watch what we do and I know that our folks are very in tune with the
appropriate opportunities to go after. You know, we have the capital and liquidity to continue to move forward and
the conservative nature of our underwriting puts us in a position today to continue operating. And we've said that
all along, that's our business model.
We're not as flashing during the expansion periods but, pretty solid during the downturn and I think that creates
stability for lending from our perspective, and continuous business activities. So, I'll tell you, our employees, not

the – you know I made prepared comments, but these people have worked countless hours doing the PPP
program, managing the credit risk. I could go on and on and on. I mean, I'm so impressed with what they've been
able to do. And our pipeline, if you look at our production over the last quarter, you know our production was
pretty comparable to the previous quarter the post-COVID quarter that we were comparing to.
So, again, they're not just sitting at home, which is what I was afraid was going to happen. They're working very
hard and my hat's off to our employees who are passionate about their customers. They care and they're very
eager to make sure we get through this and get through it soundly. There is a lot of activity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
But so, as we – as we look forward though, that's the type of stuff we should be assuming not not think M&A. Is
that correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
At this point, I don't – we've said the last three years were not focused on. I don't think this would be the
appropriate time to focus on it. We need to ride the ship here from an economic perspective as a country, and we
need to get a better feeling for what's going to happen. There's a lot of uncertainty as we move forward. But the
one thing I'm certain about is the quality of the people that we have and our ability to manage through it.
We've proven it before during – this is the same management team through the last crisis, and many of the
bankers are the same. So, I feel very confident that we're going to get through this and we'll be in a great position
to decide what we want to do on the other end of it. Maybe M&A, after we're through this, is a distinct possibility
for us given the strength of the company. So, I – we'll play that card down the road, I think as we sit today.
The other thing I will mention, Jared, is, we opened our PPP program up to non-clients in our newer markets
because we felt that some of the larger institutions were incapable of delivering. And in the first round of PPP, our
people originated $2.1 billion. We were able to convert 83% and fund 83% of the applications that we brought in.
Most of the large banks were in the low-20s or 30% range.
So, we brought over a lot of clients or prospects that are now clients that will lead to future opportunities for our
bankers because they're now part of the capital structure of these companies. So, I'm optimistic once we get
through this about that as well, there's at least 2,000 middle market prospects that we now have a relationship
with. So, we'll see how that all plays out down the road. But very good execution by our employees and that's why
we're where we are.

Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Hey. Good morning, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Good morning, Russell.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Just a follow-up on the deferral conversation earlier. So, I understand your kind of holistic view on this exposure.
So, the 98% that's current and in good standing coming into the pandemic. But do you guys consider these
customers to be higher risk given that they are in a forbearance program currently? And if so, is that accounted
for in the current reserve?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
The answer is yes. I mean, those – or many of those customers, Russell, with the onset of the pandemic and the
shock to the economy and the shock to everyone in the business community, a significant number of them were
wanting to be cautious. Some of them drew their lines up. Our line draws went up to about 46%, 47%. They
wanted to grab liquidity. They looked for deferrals. 75%-plus of our commercial deferrals decided to pay the
interest, not take interest deferrals.
So, they paid the interest at their own volition. The more compromised industries took P&I deferrals as we've
talked about. The books are relatively small. Hotels and restaurants have been severely impacted. I would expect
those clients in those industries to be taking second deferral opportunities due to the volatility in opening,
reopening, closing down and what does the future look like.
That all being said, the deferrals in the restaurant business has been remarkably low at – I think it's about 32%.
That has been quite surprising to us that it's not been higher. So, the risk ratings have been dealt with. The risk
ratings continued to be dealt with. Second requests will cause additional further downgrades. And we feel that we
have the appropriate risk classifications across the credits in the portfolio at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
I appreciate that, Gary. And then, apologies if I missed it, but did you guys disclosed where criticized and

Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Thanks, Gary. And then, from a timing perspective on charge-offs, whatever the magnitude, obviously, a lot
of unknowns of stimulus and forbearance. But, I guess, just your assumptions around timing in terms of when we
could see charge-offs begin to start going up from – you've still had a very solid first half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I would tell you, Russell, that you're going to see that impact in Q4 and into 2021. You may see a little
impact late in Q3. But I would tell you Q4 and into 2021 would be my view.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Thanks, Gary. And then, last one for me, guys. You've provided some broad strokes on the PPNR guide for
the third quarter and tightened up the expense range for us, so appreciate that. But trying to tie it all together, do
you think you can maintain this level of PPNR Q-Q based on the puts and takes of that PPNR guide?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, I think we give you all the drivers, Russell, right. So, I think kind of given you the moving parts there. I think if
you go through some of the elements, if you think about net interest income, for instance, right, we're going to
have one month LIBOR today is at 18 basis points. So, it averaged 36 basis points in the second quarter. So, if
you bring that down into $5 billion to $8.5 billion, it's about $3.8 million a quarter of net interest income just from
the LIBOR adjusted there, okay? And then, you have – the purchase accounting I mentioned was $13 million. I
would still expect it to be strong in the third quarter, probably a little bit lower than that, but it's still kind of a good
level. I will expect it to still kind of be in the double digits at least. So, that's an element to net interest income.
And then, the PPP loans, you'll have the full $2.5 billion, those are added to net interest income and added it to
margin, the longer they're funded with TBAs. So – and as I mentioned earlier, we're going to continue to work
down the cost of the interest-bearing deposits, so that clearly will have a positive impact.
So – but kind of net-net, net interest income I would expect to be down a little bit. The fee income should still be at
a very strong level. The guidance, as I mentioned there, we would expect the service charges to bounce back up.
I mean, they were running in the kind of 40% to 50% year-over-year declines of the transaction volumes and
that's running more in the 20% to 25%. So, I would expect to see kind of that element of non-interest income to
increase some. I mean, mortgage at $16 million, $17 million, is a record high. I wouldn't expect that to be as

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
strong as that, but I would expect that to still kind of be in the double digits for sure. And we'll see. There's a lot of
pipelines high, there's lot of activity continuing to go on and this is a busy time for that business.
And then, the capital markets piece, that number set a couple of new records in a row. I would expect that to be
very strong again in the third quarter. I can't predict another record, but I expect it to be very strong kind of relative
to what's in there. And then, some of the other key businesses that were down, the wealth and insurance
businesses, I would expect those to kind of bounce back up. So, non-interest income in total kind of will reflect all
those drivers. So, again, there's a lot moving parts. And the service charges, we'll see how that plays out. The
recent movement increase in the transaction still down but it's not down as much, and it will be helpful.
And then, the expense side, as you know, we manage expenses very closely as a company and we always do.
And the expenses have been – if you look at it kind of on an operating core basis, they've been very, very flat. So,
I think that that will help overall.
So, I mean, where the PPNR ends up net-net, I mean, we'll see. I would still expect it to be very strong. I think
when you look at where it was for the first six months, $236 million on a year-to-date basis, I mean, I'll expect it to
still be very strong again in the third quarter. So – and I'm not giving you a number, but trying to give you guys all
the different drivers and kind of understand what we're seeing and just what the outlook is from where we sit
today.

Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I want to go back to Casey's question earlier. So, the total risk-based capital estimate would be about 11.9%. I
think last quarter – there's a slide in here, I think it was 11.6%, 11.6%. It was 11.8% at the end of the year, 11.6%
at the end of March., so the estimate is 11.9% for where we would be at the end of June.

Good morning, Collyn.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
It's a long call, so I have to be quick. So just starting quickly on Vince Calabrese, just a question on the PPP
impact. So, in terms of the interest income contribution in 2Q related to PPP, I think calculate maybe roughly $16
million. Can you just verify that? And then also related to PPP, what's the OpEx benefit was, you've sort of alluded
to it, but from the deferred loan origination costs from PPP loans also in the second quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Sure. The $1.9 billion – the total interest income on that for the quarter was basically $15 million for the quarter.
So, 3.15% yields will get to – if you use those two pieces of $1.9 billion. And then we'll have, like I said, the $2.5
billion average we would have since [indiscernible] (01:19:24) forgiveness yet in the third quarter. So – and that
3.15% includes accretion of the portion of the fees that I mentioned earlier.
And then, the FAS 91 deferred origination cost went up by $3.7 million from the first quarter to the second quarter,
which is just driven by – the PPP is obviously the biggest driver of that. So, that benefit helps on the expense
side. And then, that kind of comes in – that your accretion comes in net of that, that's the yield adjustment over
the remaining life as well as the fees, but obviously there's a net positive [indiscernible] (01:19:59) fees minus the
cost. So, that was the delta for the quarter of $3.7 million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then, just lastly, Gary, great color on some of the credit moves especially with the
retail CRE. Just curious if you could give us a little bit maybe similar credit metrics within the hotel book. I mean,
it's a small percent of the overall book, I get it, 1.5% or whatever. But just looking at the reserve on that, the
1.56%, just kind of where you have comfort, like, what about that book gives you comfort that that's the right
reserve level?

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. In terms of that portfolio, Collyn, when you look at the performance of it, a significant chunk of that portfolio
in excess of $100 million or probably about 40-plus-percent of it is what I would call our few core customers in that
space. We have never been a hotel lender other than some very strong well-heeled long-tenured hotel
professionals who have built up significant capital. So, there's a good chunk of that business that is very, very
sound.
The majority of the rest of it came from acquisitions. You'll recall that the portfolio got up in excess of $530 million
to $550 million post-acquisition. We have run it down to $350 million. We have not lent into the space for over four
years at this point. Delinquency on that book and naturally, some of the weaker smaller hotels, when I say that,
I'm talking about small mom-and-pop shops which we've got through some acquisitions were helped surely by the
government stimulus and the deferral programs.
But delinquency is at 15 basis points. And we've really de-risked that portfolio over the last few years, as I
mentioned. Is it going to withstand some losses? Absolutely. We understand that and we'll work through what we
can with our clients. And you'll probably have some increases in non-accrual assets in that book as well. I would
surely expect as we move forward. But generally speaking, I feel good about the position of it. We've moved
higher risk assets off the books and we'll have to deal with some. Hopefully, that helps give you some color there.

Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
With the discount on the loan portfolios, so when you go through the CECL accounting and you gross up the
acquired loans into the loan balance, it's just a discount that gets accreted in. I mean, that's just the way the
accounting rules work. It's basically works – marks that we have left on the acquired loans prior to CECL...

Brody Preston Q

Okay. All right. Thanks for that. The 1.54% reserve ratio ex-PPP, the CECL is supposed to be for expected
lifetime losses, so just want to know if you could give us a sense for what that sort of implies within your modeling
for, I guess, near-term peak NPAs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
In terms of peak NPAs, Brody, I'm not going to sit here and speculate on that. That's a difficult thing to do. There's
so much volatility in the environment when you look at where is this thing going. I don't think any of us really
know. When you look at the economy today and where it's going, I would tell you that you're going to see
increases in NPAs as we work through this situation across the industry. As far as giving – throwing out a peak
number, I don't feel comfortable doing that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. All right. And then, I guess, maybe switching gears to PPP. Just given the cost of servicing the PPP loans
and some of the, I guess, the longer time line of working through forgiveness, have you all considered selling
these loans to a third-party like we've seen some smaller banks do?

Yeah. I mean, we've received calls on that, and the people who want to buy it want to kind of get the – all the
income for free, so it really doesn't work. I mean, we've looked at it. For us, we think it's better to keep it on the
balance sheet just given the price points that people are talking about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A

Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
So, once you originate it, I think you have it. It's going to lead to, for us, first of all, it was beneficial to our clients,
so – and they're very appreciative of it. It helps build loyalty. I think for us to sell it at this point would not go over
well. And, again, we were able to build out an automated process that made it very efficient. We were one of the
few banks that had an end-to-end digital process. We introduced bankers along the way. We had thousands
bankers interacted with clients. But they had a fully digitized process, paperless process, to bring them on.
So, the same is going to happen with forgiveness for us. We invested pretty heavily internally in the resources to
be able to do that. That's a differentiator for our company. And we're going to have a very slick system that's
online that permits forgiveness, watch the client through step by step.
On forgiveness, it enables them to upload documents digitally. An so, we're able to do it a little more efficiently, a
smaller bank might struggle. They've had to outsource probably a portion to that or maybe all of it. So, at that
point, they may be looking to get out from under the burden of processing those forms.
Considering in most cases smaller banks, it was a larger percentage of their total assets. For us, it's the
substantial portfolio, but we can manage it with the resources that we have. Plus, mentioned the thousands of
non-customers that we were had relationships with, our bankers have been calling on, they called in and said,
hey, I can't get my PPP loans through my large bank, would you be willing to do it for us? We accommodated
those requests.
I will say something else too that I didn't mention, I mention in my prepared comments. Our folks reached out to
100 community groups and non-profits in low to moderate income communities across our footprint. It was before
it became an issue. And we were able to originate $0.5 billion in PPP loans in those low to moderate income and
rural communities where the job retention is critically important. So, we're very proud of what we did and I think
we've done a masterful job of underwriting them, of ensuring that we have good quality borrowers on the other
end, and we're going to carry that through.

That's our philosophy – overall philosophy on it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
All right. And then, on the – just going back to the margin liquidity, you had a pretty significant increase in cash,
$370 million or so. I just wanted to understand how much of that was driven by PPP, if any? And sort of what you
expect for cash balances moving forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. The influx of the deposits that we had, which exceeds the loans and loan-to-deposit ratio coming down to
92%, kind of captures all of that. As Vince mentioned in his remarks, we went from having overnight borrowings to
investing the few hundred millions that you mentioned in there, which really isn't that big on our balance sheet.
And kind of as we sit here today, that's 1 and above zero. So, as deposits, at some point will get utilized, that
number will kind of flux up and down as that happens.
And then, in the meantime, PPP is such a big driver to the numbers. We continue to add new relationships and
new accounts and gaining some business. And, to Vince's point, 25% of the PPP customers were prospects, so
were non-customers. So that's a pool of clients that we're going to be, actively...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And they opened depository relationships with the bank because they needed to fund the loan. Some of them
chose to move additional deposits over or expand the relationship. So, when you look at – we actually tracked the
PPP fundings. We have a system that we put in place. It's not 100% accurate, but we developed when we were
originating to watch flows of funds, migration of funds. And what we've seen is an expansion in the number of
accounts that we have with that pool of customers. So the deposit balances, in certain instances, exceed the
amount of PPP loan that was funded.
That's helped us. I mean, if you look at the deposits overall, we're up over – well over the amount of PPP
balances. And some of those balances went and moved over to pay down existing debt. So, we're looking pretty
good from a deposit perspective. I mean, I feel pretty good about our funding base and our ability to gain
households.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And our teams are working to expand those relationships, to Vince's point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. And that's in the midst of the pandemic. So, I think social, civil unrest, I think our – like I said, our people
have done a tremendous job. I couldn't be prouder.

All right. Great. That's it for me, everyone. Thank you for the time this morning and thanks for taking my
questions.

Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A

William J. Wallace Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey, guys. I'll try to be quick. One quick modeling question. On the PPP, based on the way the rules are written
today, what is your expectation of the percent of loans that will be forgiven?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, I think in total, I would think that the vast majority of that will be forgiven. I mean, it's got to be in the 90s. I
mean, we don't know with certainty. Vince mentioned the – we're talking about an automatic forgiveness for loans
below $150,000. I'm not sure if that's going to happen or not, but that clears out. I mean, our average I think was...

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
...we did a pretty good job, Will. When you brought clients in, there was an opportunity to walk them through what
would be required for forgiveness. And I think our folks, based upon what we required, there was a certification by
the lender that we required that they validated certain pieces of information and had discussion. That's why we
had 1,000 – reactivated 1,000 bankers across multiple lines of business to interact with the clients. That will
helping in the forgiveness process. That will help us achieve a higher percentage of forgiveness.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
William J. Wallace Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And then, Will, just to restate what I said earlier, I mean, our assumption right now or our estimate just based on
kind of informed estimate was to get 15% in the fourth quarter, have 75% of total forgiveness by the end of March,
and then 90% by the end of June is kind of at least what we're thinking about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William J. Wallace Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Thank you very much. And then, one big question for you, Vince D. In your prepared remarks, you gave
some numbers that suggest a pretty significant increase in utilization of the digital network with your customer
base. You guys had been pretty diligent and thoughtful about your branch network over the years and you've
slowly consolidated it. I'm wondering if the increase in utilization of the digital network changes the way you might
approach the decisions around the branch network, if you could talk about that, and that's all. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I appreciate the question. It's a great question. I think that obviously in this environment, there's been, let's
say, an accelerated educational process for clients. We had such a huge increase in adoption in those digital
channels. We've always focused on the interface with the client. We always believe that we – what we can control
because we're not – we don't have unlimited budget was how easy it is for a consumer to interact with us, and
that's really what we focused on the interface. I think our folks did an exceptional job with our website. I'd
recommend if you haven't been on it, go on and take a look at our website.
It's designed in a way that's very easy and intuitive to purchase products and services or view educational
content. The ability to put that out is going to make changes. The educational process that took place through
COVID-19 will certainly push users to that platform. We had a process, we've closed a lot of branches, I mean,
we've consolidated, I don't even know the numbers, but generally 15 to 20 a year over the last five years have
been consolidated. Some of it throughout M&A, some of it opportunistically because of the change in client
preferences.
I would expect that to continue. But I will tell you that throughout this process, a number of clients have written me
letters, sent me emails, stopped me on the street, and asked when are your lobbies going to be open. Small
business customers still like going to the branch and they want to go and make their deposits at the branch
because in many instances, they still use cash, coin and currency, and they need to come in. Clients, when they
have issues, like to stop in.
So, I think it's going to be – there was an article that S&P just did. It illustrated our concept branch. I think there
will be fewer branches. The design of the branch and how we deliver content on products and services will
change. But there will always be a need. There may be fewer of them and we're going to continue to look at that
to drive efficiency.
So, our strategy was to invest in the front end system, to invest in the ability to provide products and services in a
comprehensive manner, focusing on the interface, and then making sure our branches are -branch system is

optimized and structured appropriately to accommodate conversations and that content. So, anyway, that's – I
see that continuing – that trend continuing. It will afford us with an opportunity to operate more efficiently as we
move forward, anyway.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey, guys. Most of my questions, they're answered. So, just a couple of housekeeping. Just, Vince, I think you
said on the service charge incomes, you expect – I know it's down this quarter, but you did expect some bounce
back. I think you said it was like 40% down, and now it's down – it's only down 20%, kind of that range. Just how
do we think about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
You got it, Brian.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. So, just want to make sure I got that right. And then just with the accretion numbers, yeah, I guess, just a
timeframe we should think about recovering that remaining, whatever, $77 million, Vince, I guess, given the –
some of the balance – I guess, the dropdown this quarter, just most of that is captured by maybe the end of next
year. Is it going to, I guess, is that fair to think about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I mean, the vast majority would be I say over the kind of the two years, two to three years, I would probably
say, it's probably reasonable. By the end of next year, I would think we have kind of the bulk of it kind of coming
through. I mean, it's a function of prepayments, too, right? So...

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2020
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And as we said, more of the loans end up prepaying or go different, rebuying government programs or something.
You have more of that that will come in. But I'd say, a two- to three-year kind of timeframe, Brian, is probably
reasonable.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. And then, just the last one for me, guys. The impact of the PPP on margin, I guess, this quarter, I guess, or
just in general, I guess, your comment on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I mean, it's actually additive to the margin. I mean, if you look at – I mentioned the yield at 3.15%. I mean...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
...funding it basically deposits of 3 basis points. So, you have a spread of about 3.12%. So, if you do the math, it's
having 10 basis points, 15 basis points, I would say, to the margins during that short period there. So, it's going to
be a function of how long those are around as far as them coming through and how long we haven't funded with
demand deposits, right. So, at some point, the customers are going to start to use those funds, and then, your mix
of how you're funding it will change.
But what I can say for certain is, with the second quarter impact, there was a 3.12% spread which, as you can
see, if you do the math, that is obviously additive to the margin going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah. Okay, okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Vince. That's all I had.
