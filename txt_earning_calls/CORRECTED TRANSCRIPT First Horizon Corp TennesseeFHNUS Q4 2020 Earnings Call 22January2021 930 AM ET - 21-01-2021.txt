MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the First Horizon Corp. Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. All
participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an
opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.
I now like to turn the conference over to Ellen Taylor. Please go ahead.

Ellen A. Taylor
Head-Investor Relations, First Horizon National Corp. (Tennessee)
Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. We know it's been quite a start for the year. On
our call today are CEO, Bryan Jordan; and CFO, BJ Losch, who'll provide an overview of our results and then
we'll be happy to take some questions. We're also really pleased to have Susan Springfield, our Chief Credit
Officer with us today.
Our remarks will reference the earnings presentation, which is available at ir.fhnc.com, and I need to remind you
that we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties and you should review the
factors on page 2 of our presentation and in our SEC filings that may cause our results to differ from our
expectations. Our statements today reflect our views, as of today, and we aren't obligated to update them. We will
also address our adjusted results in our remarks, which are non-GAAP measures and please review the GAAP
information in our supplement and on page 3 of our presentation.
And so now, I'm going to give it to Bryan.

D. Bryan Jordan
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Thank you, Ellen. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. I guess it would be the understatement
of the year to say 2020 was not an unusual year. It was a very unusual year and it proved to be one of
unprecedented challenges, not only for our industry, but for our economy, our society. I'm extremely pleased
however with the great work that First Horizon has accomplished in 2020. We continue to serve our customers,
our communities and our associates throughout the pandemic with PPP loans, charitable contributions and by
offering our associates increased flexibility and benefits, while demonstrating prudent risk management. We've
made impressive progress on the integration of our MOE, despite the pandemic, enhancing our scale and
providing opportunities to capitalize on additional growth opportunities in attractive markets. We also continue to
focus on delivering strong shareholder value. Fourth quarter results were solid, with continued relative underlying
strength in PPNR, given resilient results in our countercyclical businesses and continued expense discipline.
Loan demand remained muted, given current -- continued economic and political uncertainty. However, our lower
risk loans to mortgage companies business has provided some nice offset to these headwinds.
At the same time, we continued to make progress on our lower funding – lowering our funding cost in the face of
increasing levels of liquidity.
On the expense front, we generated a total of $56 million of annualized merger-related cost saves in the quarter
and now have increased our initial target of a net $170 million to $200 million. Our capital levels remain healthy

with the CET1 ratio of nearly up 50 basis points from last quarter to 9.67%, and we grew tangible book value per
share by 3% to $10.23 at quarter end, reflecting ongoing earnings momentum.
We also believe, we're well reserved for future loan losses, given the benefit of the merger accounting and
prudent stance on reserves. And our internal stress test results in December highlight our ability to navigate the
Fed's severely adverse economic scenario with more than adequate capital levels as well as a lower risk nature of
our loan portfolios.
It is important to note that as we entered the year, we are increasingly optimistic about our path to economic
recovery as we expect to see the rollout of vaccines accelerate near-term, providing benefits in the back half of
the year, but we will continue to monitor the landscape carefully. We remain confident in this -- excuse me, we
remain confident that the strength of our highly attractive franchise and the benefits of our merger of equals
position us well to capitalize on tremendous opportunity when the pandemic-related slowdown ends and we are
strongly committed to delivering top quartile returns over the medium term.
With that, I'll hand it over to BJ. BJ?

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. Before we dive into the results, let's start on slide 6 and take a look
at some notable and other unusual items that we had in the quarter just to level set.
As Bryan mentioned, we're really pleased with the performance this quarter as we delivered GAAP EPS of $0.42,
or $0.46 on an adjusted basis, which excludes notable items related to merger integration costs outlined on the
left-hand section of this slide.
We also highlight for you on this slide, some other items of a non-recurring nature that you might find helpful as
you consider and review our results and outlook. These items resulted in a net $11 million reduction to our results,
as you can see on the right-hand of the slide.
Revenue was reduced by approximately $8 million, which included a $5 million reduction in NII, largely tied to the
true-up of annualized costs of a promotional credit card offering that we did in late 2019, that resulted from an
operational issue in mailing disclosures to customers that weren't eligible for the lower rate. We went ahead and
we corrected this but determined that we should honor those promotional rates to those customers.
In December, we also opportunistically repositioned part of the securities portfolio, which near term resulted in a
$3 million loss, which you can see in the other non-interest income line, but it will provide a nice NII benefit going
forward.
In December, we announced a one-time bonus to employees making less than $75,000 and we determined that
we should allow a COVID-related rollover of some unused vacation time. These two items totaled $8 million in the
quarter.
And finally, our other non-interest expense reflects a reduction in regulatory costs, largely FDIC expense resulting
from the close of the quarter and the merger, which lowered other non-interest expense by $5 million.
On the following pages, we've highlighted our adjusted results before the impact of these unusual items, which we
believe provides a better view of our underlying earnings momentum.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2021
Moving to slide 7 for some highlights of our adjusted financials. We saw adjusted PPNR of $335 million, a
decrease of $17 million linked quarter, largely driven by that net $11 million reduction on unusual items that we
just went over. While seasonality impacted some of our fee businesses, overall trends were solid despite
continued NII headwinds. Adjusting for the unusual items, our revenue, expenses and PPNR were all relatively
stable relative to the third quarter.
Provision expense decreased to $1 million on $29 million of net charge-offs, reflecting a $28 million reserve
release given the improving economic outlook. Solid PPNR and modest provision resulted in tangible book value
per share growth of 3% linked quarter and helped drive our ROTCE up over 18% in the quarter as well even as
our capital ratios increased.
Turning to net interest income on slide 8. We generated NII of $522 million, down $11 million linked quarter,
driven by a $13 million reduction in net merger-related and PPP loan benefits, as well as the $8 million reduction
from those unusual items. So stepping back and looking at it on an underlying basis, our core NII improved $8
million before unusual items to $484 million as the $13 million reduction in deposit funding costs more than offset
the impact of a modest 1% decline in average loan and securities portfolio balances linked quarter.
We've continued to focus on lowering our interest-bearing deposit costs, which you can see reduced by an
additional 10 basis points in the quarter to 26 basis points. And we continue to push that even lower with a target
of about 21 basis points by year-end. Reported NIM came in at 2.71% in 4Q 2020, down from 2.84% in 3Q,
largely reflecting a 7 basis point decrease in merger and PPP benefits, as well as a 3 basis point decline from the
unusual items. As you would expect, we also continue to see elevated levels of excess liquidity weigh on the
margin with our average excess cash up about $2.6 billion in the quarter, which pressured the margin by 9 basis
points as we ended the quarter with approximately $7.6 billion of excess cash.
As we've discussed in the past, this doesn't influence net interest income much, but as we look forward to the
year and the impact of incremental government relief, we're likely to see further pressure on the margin near-term
from those elevated cash balances.
Now moving on to slide 9 and a review of our fee income results. Countercyclical fee businesses, particularly
fixed income and mortgage banking continued to deliver strong results in the quarter. And this quarter, they were
helped by higher deposit-related fee income as well. Fixed income average daily revenue of $1.5 million was
relatively stable from the third quarter to fourth quarter. Fixed income fees themselves decreased $7 million linked
quarter, largely reflecting the impact of day count and lower fees in ancillary products. But we continued to
produce strong average daily revenues at that $1.5 million level.
Mortgage banking fees also remained fairly strong despite seasonally lower production with fee income of $57
million and further expansion on gain on sale spreads, which were up 7 basis points. Additionally, we saw service
charges rebound to near pre-COVID levels, up $3 million in the quarter driven by higher cash management fees,
and we also saw modest improvements among all other categories.
Both fixed income and mortgage banking were up significantly year-over-year in the fourth quarter, demonstrating
the considerable offset to the rate pressures that these businesses provide us to our overall results.
Turning to expenses on slide 10, we continue to demonstrate our commitment to expense discipline. Our adjusted
expense remained relatively stable even with the net $3 million impact tied to unusual items and incentives and
commissions as well as other non-interest expense. Total personnel costs were up $4 million in the quarter,

including $8 million of costs tied to our one-time employee bonus and vacation accrual. And importantly, we
continue to make progress towards our new target of $200 million of merger saves with an incremental $6 million
or a total of $14 million in the quarter. In this low growth and low rate environment, we think we are well-
positioned to continue to manage expenses down to help improve profitability and returns.
Turning to the balance sheet on slides 11 and 12, we provide a view of our loan growth and our funding profile.
And as expected, our average in period-end loans decreased as customer demand remained soft, payoffs
remained high and utilization rates have stabilized. However, as a countercyclical business, our loans to
mortgage companies posted average linked quarter growth of roughly $700 million, reflecting strong volume tied
to the low rate environment.
On the liability side, period-end deposits were up $2.5 billion from last quarter, reflecting an increase in interest-
bearing and demand deposits. Active management of our interest-bearing deposit costs drove a decrease of 10
basis points to 26 basis points overall. We also further improved our funding profile as 4Q 2020 borrowings
decreased by about $600 million from 3Q. We will continue to evaluate ways to deploy our excess cash balances
and seek additional opportunities, as I talked about, to decrease those costs of funds.
Starting with slide 13 and looking at asset quality, we are very pleased with our overall positioning here. Credit is
performing much better than any of us would have imagined at the start of the pandemic. Net charge-offs
improved to 19 basis points, down from unusually high levels in the third quarter, which were driven by the energy
portfolio, and non-performing loans decreased 14% to 66 basis points. As I said earlier in the quarter, we had $29
million in net charge-offs with $23 million of that energy-related. Therefore, the rest of the portfolio, more broadly,
had only $6 million in net charge-offs, outstanding performance.
As you can see on slide 14, we decreased our overall allowance for credit losses by $28 million. And as we've
done since the adoption of CECL, we utilized Moody's scenarios and then incorporated other economic and
portfolio factors to evaluate the reserve.
If you look at slide 15, we provide an updated view of those portfolios that investors had been most focused on in
the wake of the pandemic, and we continue to do very detailed portfolio reviews of industries currently affected by
COVID-19 that has resulted in a 24% decrease in those portfolios, subject to a heightened level of monitoring.
We now have 7.5% roughly of loans that are subject to that monitoring. We provide a data in the appendix as well
on the reserve coverage by portfolio, in addition to information on deferrals which improved to less than 1% of
total loan balances from down from 2.5% last quarter. Again, we feel very comfortable with our risk profile and our
reserve levels.
Moving quickly to capital on page 16. As I mentioned before, tangible book value per share of $10.23 was up 3%
on strong earnings, which, with addition to a reduction in risk-weighted assets, helped drive that 46 basis point
improvement in our CET ratio to 9.7%. And very importantly, with tangible book value per share now at $10.23
and growing, the IBERIA merger of equals is now accretive to tangible book value after only six months well
ahead of the over two-year earnback, we estimated at announcement.
Moving on to slide 17 in merger integration, there's a lot of great work going on here. We've finalized our three-
year strategic plan, which is focused on capitalizing on the organic growth opportunities across our new expanded
franchise. On the people side, we continue to align teams and cultures. We're seeing good retention. And over the
last quarter, we've implemented new sales and credit team structures as well.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2021
Operationally, we've already consolidated our mortgage platforms, we've launched a new and improved wire
system, we've completed major upgrades to the online banking systems as well. We also combined procurement
and expense systems, continued to streamline corporate real estate with much more to come.
In the fourth quarter, we delivered $14 million in cost savings, providing that annualized benefit of $56 million as
we entered 2021. And as we noted earlier, we upsized the targeted annualized cost saves to $200 million, which
we expect to achieve by the first half of 2022. And as you can see, we've provided an estimated timeline for those
cost saves on the right-hand part of this slide.
Slide 18, we've provided an overview of our expectations for both the first quarter and the full year, but it's really
important to note, as Bryan, alluded to earlier that as we enter the year, the macro environment remains highly
uncertain with more variability than any of us would like. The progression of the rollout of the vaccine and its
efficacy will matter a great deal of course as will the pace and influence of government relief as it ripples across
the economy. However, as the newly combined company, we're committed to enhance transparency as we work
to drive shareholder value and our outlook reflects our current view that we will continue to see a prolonged low
rate environment given current Fed posturing, but, with an economic recovery beginning in the second half of the
year as headwinds from the pandemic hopefully subside.
For our full-year outlook, we provided an annualized baseline that's based on our fourth quarter results and from
that we expect a low- to mid-single digit percent decline in NII, given the outlook for muted loan growth and
moderating impacts from net accretion relative to that 4Q 2020 baseline. While we anticipate a continued
relatively strong environment near-term for our mortgage and fixed income businesses, our outlook reflects a low
teens decrease in fees from strong 4Q annualized levels and our mortgage origination outlook largely
corresponds with the NBA's outlook.
On the expense front, we expect non-interest expense to be down in the low to mid-single digit range with results
excluding incentives and commissions down low single digits.
As we've noted, our ongoing focus on efficiency and cost saves should result in an expense decline over the next
year. The range in provision expense could be significant and it's going to be largely dependent on the forward
outlook but we expect net charge-off performance to be strong, somewhere in the range of 25 to 35 basis points.
And if that occurs given an ACL excluding loans to mortgage companies and PPP of a little over 2.1% we are very
well positioned to see lower provisions as opposed to higher provisions if that outlook does come to fruition.
Finally, we expect to see our CET1 ratio come in around 9.5%, reflecting the expectation for risk-weighted assets
to be modestly lower and the potential to opportunistically repurchase shares over the course of the year. We've
also provided our outlook for the first quarter in the context of this overall guidance for the year. Hopefully, that's
helpful. And as Bryan mentioned, we feel good about the positioning and our ability to perform well given the
environment.
So quickly wrapping up on slide 19, we're well-positioned over the long-term to capitalize on the opportunities of
our more diversified business model and our highly attractive Southern franchise. Our countercyclical businesses
are proving out their ability to help mitigate pressure from lower rates. We believe the advantage of merger cost
saves is a differentiator and that our approach to risk management should help us mitigate credit losses with the
benefit of significant loss absorption. While the economic environment remains challenging and loan demand soft
gives us the ability to maintain our strong focus on merger integration over the next year. And ultimately, we
continue to believe we're well-positioned on a relative basis to deliver top quartile returns.

D. Bryan Jordan
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Thank you, BJ. Our strong balance sheet, capital and liquidity will serve us well in this difficult environment. We've
maintained underwriting standards and built a diversified portfolio focused on profitability. Despite the economic
headwinds, we are positioned to capture merger opportunities with enhanced scale, better efficiency and
improved earnings power to create shareholder value. And as BJ said, our outlook for 2021 is constructive.
Thank you to all our associates for their hard work, serving our customers, our communities and helping deliver
value for our shareholders.
Grant, we'll now open it up for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will
come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
By the great job on the outlook and guidance, BJ, so thank you. But just a question around net loan growth, give
us a sense of one, what you see, understand the year is going to start out slow, but just talk to us given sort of the
combined capability within First Horizon and IBERIA, how you see loan growth trending if the economy continues
to reopen? And then your outlook on the mortgage warehouse business as well despite the decline forecasted by
the [ph] MBA (00:23:03), do you expect to outperform the market?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Ebrahim, thanks for the question. As we look at 2021, we see loan growth as we talked about maybe
modestly down on an average basis, but there's a lot of moving parts in there. One is clearly on PPP loans, we
expect that the first round of PPP loans to come off quite substantially by the end of the year. And with them

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2021
starting at about $4 billion, we expect a couple of billion or more of runoff there. They'll be replenished by the new
PPP loans coming on. But we don't expect at this point to have the same type of balances, the second round as
we saw in the first. So that's a little bit of the decline.
The second is, broadly speaking, in consumer and commercial lending. Loan growth is generally muted across
our markets. And so particularly in the first half of the year, we have lower expectations of demand. Though we
did have in our most recent month our strongest production month that we've seen in the last 12, so that's
encouraging. But it's still muted.
On the flip side though, we do see strength in our asset-based lending business, which has done quite well over
the last quarter or so. And the mortgage company business, notwithstanding the NBA outlook has generated a
significant amount of customer relationships over time, as you well know, and we are very bullish on the outlook
for the outstandings in that business to continue to grow over the course of the year. Seasonality would -- we
would expect it's a little bit lower in the first quarter, but then picking up fairly materially in the second through the
fourth.
So we expect loans to mortgage companies to be stronger in the back half of the year than even the levels that
we saw in the fourth quarter. So that's kind of a little bit of color on how we see the loan growth, but there are
definitely pockets of opportunity. One more thing I would say is, if the economy does open up in the second half of
the year, our businesses have been doing an extraordinary amount of work cultivating customers, cultivating
relationships, looking for new opportunities, being prepared to take advantage of those, such that when demand
does come back, we are well-positioned. So we're very, very focused on business momentum.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Ebrahim, a few -- just a couple of more, I guess details to add what BJ said. As he mentioned that December we
saw good, both strong production, it's the strongest month we had in 2020 but it was also very broad-based, we
saw it in our specialty businesses, but we also saw it in our markets across Tennessee, Louisiana, North
Carolina, Florida, I mean, we saw – and then we saw it in the specialty businesses that BJ highlighted. And the
revenue synergies that we're seeing with the referrals and asset-based lending, equipment finance, there's a lot of
excitement with our bankers about those capabilities now that we've merged these two great companies. So I feel
good about the opportunities in the – there are strong company opportunities for us to either grow with or bring
into the company.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q

Got it. And ex-PPP in the mortgage warehouse, is there any portfolio where you expect a runoff?

William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. So, clearly, as we've talked about earlier we're highly cautious on the energy portfolio and have been letting
that run down. We're not actively running off any other portfolios, per se, but payoffs have been outpacing new
originations across many of our markets and in several of our businesses. But like Susan and I just talked about
we just had our strongest month. So there may be signs that activity is picking up a little bit. We're still expecting
though that doesn't really start to occur until the back half of the year as the front half.

Hi. Good morning.

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Maybe I guess starting with the allowance and the expectation for pretty strong credit performance, I guess how
much are you depending on CECL qualitative overlay to support a higher level of allowance here? And then
connected to that, when you look at the loans that were acquired that were double-counted with both a provision
and a mark, are you able to release any of that reserve before those loans either pay-off, you realize that
accretion from the market?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. So I'll start. So as you know on the CECL reserves, a lot of the quantitative modeling is based on what the
scenarios are going to tell you in the weightings around the scenarios. And so if we start with that and you think
through what the Moody's scenarios have done over the course of the year, i.e. continue to improve, those
quantitative models are telling us that reserves should come down in a lot of places meaningfully come down.
And so we start with those. But then there's – there are overlays that we put on quantitate – qualitatively around
those areas of perceived risk across the portfolios, because given though those models are telling us that we still
think it's a little too early to declare victory on the economy and the recovery, particularly with the uncertainty
around the vaccine rollout and so on. And so there has been a fair amount of qualitative overlay that we have put

on those quantitative models so far. So that's why our reserves coverage ended relatively stable to the third
quarter. But I would tell you that if our outlook holds again on net charge-offs in the 25 to 35 range and we've got
an ACL in the 210 range, it's we're going to have a lot of reserve release coming in 2021, if those kind of metrics
start to play out. So that would be my expectation is our provision comes down pretty meaningfully.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. And I guess, shifting to capital management, your comments around the buyback. I guess, one,
could you be in the market now if you wanted to be? Or do we need to wait for a reauthorization or any other type
of authorization? And then I guess second to that, would there be other uses of capital. There's certainly an
expectation that M&A picks up over the coming year. Now, that you've had the success with IBKC, would you be
interested in potentially being back in the market?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Hi, Jared. This is Bryan, good morning. The -- we have a current authorizations, which would allow us to get back
in the market. And as you would expect, we talk constantly with our board about capital and capital levels. So we
have the ability to repurchase shares. I would emphasize our first and foremost goal is to reinvest capital
organically in the business. And we're – as we said, expecting fairly muted loan growth in the first part of the year,
but when that picks up we want to put capital to work in the business. So that will be primary objective number
one.
We will – we'll look at inorganic opportunities but I would suggest that given all that we have on our plate to
complete the integration of MOE of IBERIABANK in First Horizon, it's unlikely that we're going to get interested or
engaged in any M&A activity. We want to put these two organizations together to do that well and then show that
we can operate these businesses in such a way that we deliver on the revenue synergies that we've talked about,
we'll deliver on the cost synergies as upsize. And we think we've got a powerful franchise that we can grow
organically.
I'll go back to one of the key points that we've made a number of times, but most prominently, in November of
2019, the footprint that we have put together is expected to grow at a pace faster than the US as a whole, and I
would suggest given some of the post-COVID impacts, that pace will actually pick up some, just based on the
relocation of people and some of the demographic changes. So we're pretty optimistic about the footprint we have
and we think we can create a lot of value with that. So I would say, if I had to summarize that a [indiscernible]
(00:33:20) focus on putting capital work in the business organically and to the extent that in the near term, we
can't do that, we'll look for opportunities to repatriate it to our shareholders.

Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Thank you. Good morning. You said that the company finalized its three-year strategic plan recently. I was just
wondering if you could go over some of the nuances that investors may be more interested in right now?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Well, yes, Jennifer, good morning. This is Bryan. I'll start and then BJ or Susan pick up. I think the biggest nuance
that I would focus on really goes back to Jared's question, which is this is a strategy that deals with operating the
business that we have and then capitalizing on the strength of the footprint that we have. We have built it at a very
granular level. We involved the entire leadership team and really the expanded leadership team, we built it from
the market levels up and we spent a lot of time thinking about markets. We thought about our lines of businesses
and our specialty businesses.
Then when we pull it all together, we think that the key things that we need to execute on are, one, investing in
talent, in people and making sure that we position ourselves to take advantage of the demographic opportunities
that we have, control costs in such a way that we fund that. And then, the other big theme is to continually think
about how we reallocate our infrastructure costs to improve our products and our services. And you'll see as we
get through this integration that we're doing a lot of work between now and the final integration of the two
companies sometime later this year to improve products and services and close any gaps in those that we have.
So we're continually evolving the business but really focused on the blocking and tackling of taking advantage of
the growth opportunities we see in this footprint.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2021
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I was actually hoping – you actually talked about the $200 million of cost saves for the revised $200 million. How
much of that falls to the bottom line versus being reinvested? And I guess the reason I ask that is because it looks
like your new guidance is pretty much consistent with kind of what – at least our expectations were which implies
a lot of it gets reinvested, but I would love your thoughts. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Well, Ken, this is Bryan. I expect what you'll see is that those cost savings will drop to the bottom line. The
guidance or the outlook slide that's there exists for 2021 and most of those cost savings will come in later in 2021
and really apply to 2022. So our expectation is that they drop to the bottom line just like the original $170 million
commitment that we laid out.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
All right. Great. And then just a quick one. Obviously, a lot of notable items totally get it, given the acquisition or
the merger. When you think about the notable items which do kind of distort your core underlying results, like, at
what point to do those items start to phase out in terms of the quarters? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah, I think, Ken, my expectation is that, towards the end of the year, the difference between reported and
adjusted is going to be very modest. Yeah, there will still be some notable items or merger-related charges that
might slip into the first half of 2022. But my expectation would be that they're largely gone by the end of this year.

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I appreciated the color on the reserve. Obviously, the potential for a reserve recapture is pretty full here. How do
you or how should we think about the appropriate level of reserves on the backside of this? I think that's one thing
analysts struggle with is, is it – how low does it prudently go?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Brock. Thank you. I've spent a lot of time thinking about this, so as Susan. If you just use day one CECL as
maybe a baseline for a pre-COVID environment, I think our reserve level with day one CECL on a combined basis
would have been about 1% in aggregate, and we're well above that right now. If you look at end of the first
quarter, which may be still has a little bit of pandemic in there, there's – it's maybe 120 basis points, right.
So, I think, over time, we tend back towards those. I've heard commentary from other banks saying, if we get back
to pre-COVID levels that by the end of this year, I'm not sure that we're totally back there by the end of this year.
But if you just do math on our metrics, going back to pre-COVID levels would imply a couple hundred million
dollars of reserve release, which is pretty massive. It happened in one year. So, I think we're all still trying to get
used to CECL and understand the variability in the outlooks, but bottom line as I think there's a lot more bias
towards us releasing reserves a lot more than there is having to even hold it, much less increase it, this year.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2021
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And just shifting over to funding, you've been working down your CD book, you've been dropping
that rate as well, similar trend with the borrowings. How much flex do you have in those two categories to either
lower balances or lower the rate?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. So I'll start with the borrowings first. So the borrowings we were still carrying essentially two Holdco debt
maturities, one of which we obviously retired in the fourth quarter, so that drove a lot of our borrowings down. So I
expect those to say probably relatively stable, maybe down a little bit as we try to optimize it. On time deposits,
they've been relatively low because we just hadn't seen a lot of mix shift towards those even as the rate
environment was more favorable to doing those.
So, largely, where we see CD balances today are in our small virtual bank and maybe scattered across some of
our markets. So, yeah, there's some opportunity to continue to move time deposits down as they mature. But I
think most of our emphasis and the great work that our bankers have done have been around dialogue with our
commercial clients and then making sure that our base rates on the consumer side are competitive but in line with
what we're seeing in our various markets. So I think there's a little bit more opportunity to effect change in our
interest-bearing deposits around our money market and savings accounts on consumer and commercial.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2021
So I think in the past you guys have talked about a low-double-digit ROE as a guideline, you just printed an 18%
number, so pretty far above that. Can you just remind us, what were you referring to when you were talking about
the low-double-digit ROE? And is there potentially an update to that number?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. We just printed the update of 18%, just kidding. Yeah. I think when we were talking about the low-double-
digit, it clearly had an expectation of much higher than $1 million of provision, right, so that was certainly helpful.
But I think we – on a relative basis, we continue to believe that we can generate top tier returns on tangible equity,
and I think as I've looked at consensus estimates for 2021 even 2022 and what I expect our company to do or
what we expect our company to do, we definitely believe it will generate those top tier returns. And so, will it be
18% over time? No, it won't be that high. Could it be like that for a while if provisioning is low? Yeah, in the mid-
teens range could be a good expectation. But it's all going to depend on what the provision looks like over the
next several quarters.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. That's helpful. And then I wanted to revisit the buyback. I mean you're already over the 9.5% target on
common equity tier 1, you talked about risk-weighted assets going down this year. You're going to be profitable
this year, so that's going to push that ratio even higher.
I mean, it seems – you have a stock that's still pretty cheap [ph] at 1.4% of tangible (00:45:20). I mean it seems
like the opportunity to engage in the buyback is real. Do you realistically expect to get out there and be aggressive
with the buyback this year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Brady, this is Bryan. I'm not going to bite on aggressive, because that's a term of art as opposed to science. Look,
I think you're right. I think we would show in our outlook that our capital ratios could continue to build if we didn't
reinvest or repatriate capital to our shareholders. And so we will take the opportunity when we can to repurchase
some shares. We tend to believe much like you do that we think it's an attractive valuation and we think it's a
good long-term use of the capital. So we will use it. We will continue to dialogue with our board. I think it's really
important to say as you'd think about capital in terms of being aggressive or not, there's still a fair number of
questions in terms of the pandemic that have to be resolved and we've laid out sort of our expectation. One of the
keys is that we see a pickup in the rollout of vaccinations. I would say to-date it's been woefully inadequate and
it's got to pick up for us to see a much stronger back half of the year. I believe we can do that as more vaccines
become available. And the corollary to that is what happens with these more virulent strains. And do they are
more at least more transmissible strains of COVID and do they result in more slowdown shutdown, stay-at-home
orders on a national basis. So, in terms of how we think about it, we're still cautiously optimistic about 2021, but
we're going to let this thing unfold a little bit before we start to bring capital ratios down real rapidly and we'll look
at opportunities to buy the stock over 2021.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then, finally, for me an easy one, I mean, BJ's tax rate was all over the place last year, which I get
given the volatility in profitability. But I think in the past you've talked about an effective tax rate around 23%, is
that the right way to think about it from here?

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey, just wanted to dig into the fee income outlook a little bit. You mentioned strengthening fixed income and
mortgage. Obviously, there's some seasonality components. Can you just maybe walk us through some of the
expectations for those businesses? And how that might kind of reconcile to the guidance a little bit more
specifically? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Sure. So, I'll start with mortgage. I said in my earlier comments that we don't have a view that's much different or
more well-informed than the Mortgage Bankers Association would have. So, I think that shows some modest
growth in purchase origination volume and meaningful decline in refinances.
So in aggregate, I think year-over-year originations down in the 20%, 25% range is what the MBA would be
talking about. In terms of fixed income, we still see quite an opportunity in fixed income with the longer end of the
curve continuing to inch up and yield curve steepening, still a lot of volatility and uncertainty in the marketplace.
We've still seen strong volumes in fixed income. As a matter of fact in the fourth quarter 80% of the days had over
a $1 million of revenue in the quarter, 80%. And we expect that to continue over the next few quarters. So we
expect fixed income to stay pretty strong relative to fourth quarter levels. Does that help?

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Yes, it does. And maybe it's a little bit too early to discuss quantitatively, but where are the biggest areas you see
for kind of revenue synergies at this point, I remember with a Capital Bank deal you guys did laid out some
revenue synergies, I don't know if you did the same thing this time but it would seem like you're putting these two
franchise together, the opportunity could be fairly significant. So maybe if you can just discuss that broadly?
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Sure. Absolutely. So yes, we continue to track our revenue synergies. We started as of June, excuse me, July 1.
And so they're still fairly modest given the muted growth opportunities that we're seeing. But it's in the $8 million
annualized revenue range at this point and that's early in a – in an uncertain environment. So we think that's
going to be well ahead of the $30-plus-million that we saw in Capital Bank obviously. And so as activity picks up
we're well-positioned to capture a lot of revenue synergy. And over time, as we get a little bit more of that I'm sure
that we'll share that with you and show you a little bit more color on where that's coming from.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
There is – Michael, this is Bryan, areas that we're really seeing great opportunities or products like wealth
management and the overlay to the former IBERIA portion of the franchise opportunities like mortgage origination
with the overlay to the former First Horizon portion of the franchise, our asset base lending business, our
equipment finance business, we're entertaining. We're actually closing deals in all of those areas just to name a
few.
So all of our specialty areas, international is one where we're having a great deal of conversation. So we really
see revenue synergy opportunities over a broad swath of the products. And our bankers are excited about it.
They're spending a lot of time on it and they're making an awful lot of referrals. And BJ quoted a sort of a revenue
number annualized. We think the pipeline is probably that big or bigger at this point. And as I said setting back in
the early December timeframe, the words I used were something like we'll probably blow away the $30 million of
revenue synergies that we saw a lot of Capital Bank. We just think that it's a huge opportunity for us.

Hey, John.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Just want to see if you can elaborate a little bit more on what drove the upsizing of the cost saves, I believe you
had commented on that at an earlier presentation in the quarter, but just wanted a little bit of the color behind that.
And then, secondly, does that upsizing consider incremental rationalization of your real estate both on the
corporate real estate side as well as branches just given the added impact or influence of the pandemic on top of
the merger itself? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Sure, John, it's BJ. So, as we kind of alluded to from the beginning, we were very confident in our net $170 million
when we announced it. As we started to look deeper, we continued to see more opportunities. And then of
course, the pandemic has accelerated changes in customer behavior, which has allowed us to further look at
physical branch distribution, opportunities for consolidation as well as what you said the real estate side. And so,
as we started to quantify those, we got more and more confident in exceeding the $170 million, which is why we
upsized it.
We do believe, though, that they'll come more towards a post-integration world, which we're currently still
targeting for the end of this year in terms of the large systems integration. But that'll involve a lot of real estate-
related things as we take out more cost.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hello. Okay. So, first, on expenses, so on Huntington's call this morning they talked about stepping up the pace of
investment near term to better position for an eventual recovery. And you guys are guiding down expenses in
2021 with cost saves a factor. But can you comment on the pace of investment going on behind the scenes? Is it
pretty steady or you guys are also increasing the pace?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. This is Bryan, Steve. We're – I would say we look to increase the pace in 2021. I didn't listen obviously to
Huntington's call this morning. But we see a lot of opportunities to hire and attract people to the franchise and
we're actively doing that. I would say it's a bit of a gradual acceleration as the economy seems to be getting a little
bit more front footed. And we truly do believe we can reduce costs, reallocate costs. And so Michael Brown who is
running our regional banking franchise, for example, is spending a lot of time looking at how we take opportunities
to reduce costs in one area and investment in other areas and fund our own growth that way.
So we should see our pace of investment pick up. I'd say that's true across regional banking. I'd say that's true
across our specialty businesses. We see opportunities to improve there, areas like our equipment finance and our
asset base lending businesses where we need to be able to support the broader franchise, for examples.

Hey, Steve, I'd also add that the branch acquisition of the SunTrust branch has also accelerated a lot of
investment that we wanted to make, which obviously helps our broader business, particularly around mobile and
digital banking and online banking. And so, we got that in. We put in a new wire system that significantly
upgraded things for our commercial customers. We're broadening and expanding our use of the nCino platform.

That's going to streamline a lot of our commercial lending business end to end. We've made some investments
already and continue to do so in our treasury management and cash management.
So, while there's a heavy, heavy lift, systems integration and just getting the two organizations knit together on the
back end, there are a lot of places where we're strategically putting investment for the long term and even with
that continue to take net cost out of the organization, which we think is very positive.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Steve, this is Bryan again. BJ makes a really good point here. And in that, our integration timeline is more dictated
by the investments that we want to make or closings or gaps in products and offering. So, if you looked at an
allocation of the hours we have to get the integration completed, I don't know probably 75% or more of it is
making investments and products rolling out a new online banking online platform. Things like that which we think
will give the combined customer base a better experience. And so we're really looking at how we invest in the
technology and infrastructure to make us a better organization.

Okay. That's helpful. In terms of long-term targets, I might be in the minority but I do miss the Bonefish slide. With
that said, following up on Brady's question, if you put all the pieces of the new company together, right, if we just
ignore what's going to happen with provision because who knows over the next few quarters, what do you see as
a long term target for return on tangible common equity over time?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Thank you for bringing up the Bonefish. I still like it.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Ellen is not writing this down, by the way.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Steve, we've said for a long time over time that a mid-teens return on tangible common equity
should be achievable for us. And ironically, we're above that right now and could be depending on provisions for
the next few quarters. But a mid teens area over the medium term seems like the right place for us given our
diversified business model, our efficiency opportunity and our conservative credit profile that allows us to run
capital at this 9%, 9.5% range and optimize our use of the balance sheet that way. So I still think that mid-teens is
one what we can deliver.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's very helpful. If I could ask one last question; the follow-up on Bryan's comment on M&A, right. I know
the IBERIA deal just closed, so the last thing on your mind is another deal. With that said, I just wanted to think
big picture for a minute. Bryan, before the IBERIA deal you always talked about regional banks needing to be sort
of $75 billion of assets or larger to be competitive. You ended the year at $84 billion. At this size, do you now

have the franchise you need to be competitive long-term? Or from this new vantage point, do you think you need
to be even larger to be competitive? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Thanks, Steve. Look I think in a phrase is, yes I think so. I think it would be hard to argue that you can win
a scale game that the industrial logic behind the MOE or BB&T and SunTrust and now Truist is scale and they
were both $200 billion-plus organization. So there's some arguments for greater scale. But when I look at the
combined organization that we have, I think we've got the capabilities in the product offerings and the ability to
invest in infrastructure and products and services that we can be very, very competitive and that we can be very
differentiated in the way that service shows up to our customers and our communities. He can always look for or
make arguments for why more scale would help. But at the end of the day, you have to be able to operate the
franchise as a differentiated entity and not as a – just a bigger commodity in the marketplace. And so we think this
gives us a scale to invest.
We think it allows us to continue to operate a model that puts decision making very close to the customers. It puts
it in the places that people know their markets, they know their customers and know who to do business with and
who not to do business with. And all of that, I think it that does make us a differentiated entity that can outperform
our peers in providing services and delivering returns.

Operator: Our next question will come from Chris Marinac with Janney. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey. Thanks. Bryan, as you make the fall systems converge in these next couple of quarters, are you working
towards a – the old core of First Horizon with a bunch of digital APIs to run this platform? Or do you envision
creating your own new core kind of using the best-in-class technology?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Chris, as we're moving forward, we're moving essentially to when it relates to the big loan and deposit
systems to the core of First Horizon. BJ mentioned one as an example where we're going to leverage the
technology that IBERIABANK was using with nCino. And in some cases, we're putting in place completely
upgraded systems like a wire system, our online banking systems will be updated. So but broadly speaking, we're
not blazing any trials as it relates to new generation cores, we're working on improvement and operating
technology that one or both organizations has in place and or where we can upgrade as you said would use an
API as the front end capabilities.

Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Great. So it really is different than you would have done a merger five years ago from the systems standpoint.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. I think it's not a whole lot dissimilar than what you would do. You go from one set of, you go from two sets
of systems and we went through a thoughtful analysis. I think our team did a really good job of looking what
IBERIA was using and what First Horizon was using. And we chose the best of both organizations in terms of our
ability to meet customer needs and deliver products and services. And that's where we're headed.
