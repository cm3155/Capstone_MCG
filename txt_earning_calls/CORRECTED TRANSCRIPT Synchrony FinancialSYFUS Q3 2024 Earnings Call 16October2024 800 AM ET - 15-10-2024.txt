President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Thanks, Kathryn. Good morning, everyone. Today, Synchrony reported strong third quarter results, including net
earnings of $789 million, or $1.94 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 2.6%, and a return on tangible
common equity of 24.3%. These results reflect Synchrony's commitment to driving value for our customers,
partners, providers, small businesses, and our shareholders as the operating environment continues to evolve.
During the quarter, we continued to deliver responsible access to credit through powerful omni-channel
experiences. Our broad range of flexible financing solutions and compelling value propositions continue to
resonate with customers as they engage across our diversified portfolio. We added 4.7 million new accounts and
generated $45 billion of purchase volume. Both new account and purchase volume growth continue to be
impacted by a modest pullback in consumer spending. As well as the credit actions that Synchrony has taken
since the middle of 2023 to reinforce the credit trajectory of our portfolio in 2024 and beyond.
Despite those actions, average active accounts remained stable versus last year and ending receivables grew
4%. Purchase volume and receivables at the platform level reflected a continuation of the trends we've discussed

over the course of this year. Customers continue to be selective in how and where they spend, particularly as they
manage their spend to navigate the effects of inflation on needs like groceries, utilities, and rent. Platform
purchase volume growth ranged between down 3% and down 7% year-over-year, generally reflecting lower
spend per account as customers moderated both bigger ticket and discretionary spend, particularly in categories
like furniture, electronics, cosmetic, and vision, as well as the impact of Synchrony's credit actions.
Receivables growth across the platforms ranged from 3% to 10% higher versus last year, primarily driven by
payment rate moderation. Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 43% of total purchase volume for the quarter
and decreased 2%, generally due to more selective consumer spend behavior and the impact of our credit
actions. The trends we see in the out-of-partner spend on these products have generally remained consistent with
those at the platform level. Our customers continue to be discerning in their discretionary purchases, particularly
around larger ticket categories such as home furnishing, travel and entertainment, and our prioritizing non-
discretionary spend like groceries and pharmacy.
As we would generally expect, our customers across credit grades are spending less per transaction in most
categories, with average transaction values declining 3% versus last year. More specifically, our non-prime
customers reduced their average transaction values by about 5% versus last year, while prime transaction values
moderated by 3%. Our super prime customers continue to drive more out-of-partner spend, with transaction value
declines of around 2% year-over-year. That said, customers across credit grades are transacting with relatively
stable frequency compared to last year, which has partially offset the impact of lower transaction values.
From a payment behavior perspective, we continue to see relative stability in our non-prime segment. Meanwhile,
our prime and super prime customers have continued to gradually shift from above minimum payment to
minimum payment. The proportion of less than minimum payments in our portfolio remains below the 2017 to
2019 average across all credit segments. When taken together, we believe the spend and payment trends we're
observing across our portfolio reflect a consumer that is making healthy decisions that align with their respective
priorities and budget. And as our customer needs and priorities continue to shift, Synchrony remains focused on
delivering financial solutions with compelling value propositions and broad utility for wherever life takes them. This
ability to evolve and enhance our offerings also allows us to deliver loyalty and resilient risk-adjusted returns for
our partners, providers, and merchants, and strengthen Synchrony's position as a partner of choice.
During the third quarter, we added or renewed more than 15 partners, including DICK'S Sporting Goods and
Gibson, and strategic partnerships like Albertsons. We're proud to extend our partnership with DICK'S, which
builds on our more than 20-year-long relationship. We will maintain our commitment to athletes through our
ScoreRewards credit card program by providing the ability to earn rewards twice as fast, exclusive member-only
offers, and digital account management. Athletes will be able to continue using these cards online and in stores
across the company's 800-plus retail locations, including DICK'S Sporting Goods, House of Sport, Golf Galaxy,
and Public Lands. Meanwhile, Synchrony's partnership with Gibson, the most iconic brand in the music industry,
represents what we believe to be an industry first through Gibson's launch of a direct-to-consumer credit program,
which is available on gibson.com and at the Gibson Garage Nashville flagship store.
Gibson will also participate as part of our manufacturer OEM sponsorship program to drive customer engagement
with their dealer framework, as well as the Synchrony music and sound network. Synchrony is also excited to
launch a strategic partnership between CareCredit and Albertsons Companies, a leading food and drug retailer in
our communities. This collaboration allows customers to use their CareCredit card to pay for select Health &
Wellness items in nearly 2,200 Albertsons company stores, which includes Albertsons, Safeway, Vons, Acme,
Shaw's, and Jewel-Osco. This adds to our expanding list of partners such as Sam's Club, Walgreens, and
Walmart, where CareCredit is accepted for payment of select health and wellness products and services.

And lastly, Synchrony is proud to launch a first-of-its-kind payment experience for pet parents with our patent-
pending insurance reimbursement functionality that will streamline the process for managing pet health care
expenses. Customers who have both a CareCredit and Pets Best insurance product will now be able to have their
Pets Best insurance claims directly reimbursed to their CareCredit Health & Wellness credit card. This seamless
new technology reflects Synchrony's focus on driving best-in-class experiences, and through our collaboration
with Independence Pet Holdings, builds on our commitment to enable more pets to get the veterinary care they
need. Whether it's through the delivery of scalable, innovative financial solutions that empower our customers, or
the addition and renewal of partnerships that span most consumer spend categories, Synchrony is powering
access, flexibility, and utility for our customers and partners alike, and in turn, we are driving greater long-term
value for our stakeholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss our financial performance in greater detail.

Brian J. Wenzel Sr.
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Thanks, Brian. . And good morning, everyone. Synchrony delivered another quarter of strong financial results,
demonstrating the resilience of our differentiated business model and our ability to execute across our key
strategic priorities to deliver consistently compelling outcome for our stakeholders.
Ending loan receivables reached $102 billion in the third quarter, reflecting growth of 4% compared to last year as
the benefit of approximately 60 basis point decrease in payment rate more than offset the 4% decline in purchase
volume. Net revenue grew 10% to $3.8 billion due to combined impact of higher interest and fees, lower RSA, and
higher other income. Net interest income increased 6% to $4.6 billion as interest and fees grew 7%, primarily
reflecting growth in average loan receivables and a higher loan receivable yield. Our loan receivable yield grew 30
basis points due to the combined impact of our product, pricing, and policy changes, or PPPCs, and lower
payment rate, partially offset by higher reversals.
Total interest-bearing liabilities cost was 4.78%, 44 basis points year-over-year due to higher benchmark rates.
RSAs of $914 million were 3.57% of average loan receivables in the third quarter and declined $65 million versus
the prior year, primarily driven by higher net charge-offs. And other income increased to $119 million, primarily
related to the impact of our PPPC-related fees, which were partially offset by the impact of our Pets Best
disposition and venture investment gains and losses.
Provision for credit losses increased to $1.6 billion, reflecting higher net charge-offs and a $47 million reserve bill.
Other expenses grew 3% to $1.2 billion, which was driven by cost relating to the Ally Lending acquisition,
technology investment, and preparatory expenses related to the Late Fee rule change, partially offset by lower
operational losses. The preparatory expenses related to Late Fee rule change reflected $11 million of incremental
costs related to both the execution of our PPPCs and the implementation costs of the rule itself should it become
effective.
Even with these incremental costs, the efficiency ratio was 31.2% for the third quarter, an improvement of
approximately 200 basis points versus last year, reflecting Synchrony's continued cost discipline and commitment
to driving operational leverage in our business. Taken together, Synchrony generated net earnings of $789
million, or $1.94 per diluted share. This produced a return on average assets of 2.6%, and a return on tangible
common equity of 24.3%.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2024
Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on slide 9. At quarter-end, our 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.78% versus
4.40% in the prior year, and 16 basis points above our historical average from the third quarters of 2017 to 2019.
Our 90-plus delinquency rate was 2.33% versus 2.06% in the prior year, and 20 basis points above our historical
average from the third quarters of 2017 to 2019. And our net charge off rate was 6.06% in the third quarter versus
4.60% in the prior year, and 97 basis points above our historical average from the third quarters of 2017 to 2019.
Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.79%, which was generally consistent with
the second quarter coverage ratio of 10.74%.
As shown on slide 10, the credit actions we've taken from mid-2023 to early 2024 are improving our delinquency
trajectory as the rate of year-over-year growth in both 30-plus and 90-plus delinquency rates continue to
decelerate. We'll continue to closely monitor our portfolio performance, as well as credit trends for the broader
industry, given our share of consumer, and we'll take additional credit actions if necessary. While the actions we
have taken since last year have reduced new account and purchase volume growth in the short term, we expect
they will strengthen our portfolio's position as we exit 2024 and support our ability to deliver our targeted risk-
adjusted returns over the long term.
Turning to slide 11, Synchrony's funding, capital and liquidity continued to provide a strong foundation for our
business. During the third quarter, Synchrony grew our direct deposits by approximately $780 million, reduced our
broker deposits by $1.5 billion, and issued $750 million of senior, unsecured, fixed-to-floating rate notes due in
2030. At quarter-end, deposits represented 84% of our total funding while secured and unsecured debt each
representing 8% of our total funding, respectively. Total liquid assets and undrawn credit facilities were $22.4
billion, a $1.9 billion increase versus last year, and represented 18.8% of total assets, a 60-basis-point increase
from last year.
Focusing on our capital ratios. As a reminder, we elected to take the benefit of the CECL transition rules issued
by the joint federal banking agencies. Synchrony will make a final transition adjustment to our regulatory capital
metrics of approximately 50 basis points in January 2025. The impact of CECL has already been recognized in
our income statement and balance sheet.
Under the CECL transition rules, we ended the third quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.1%, 30 basis points higher
than last year's 12.8%. Our Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.3%, 70 basis points above last year. Our total capital ratio
increased 70 basis points to 16.4%. And our Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phased-in basis increased
to 24.5% compared to 22.9% last year. Synchrony returned $399 million to shareholders during the third quarter,
which consisted of $300 million in share repurchases and $99 million in common stock dividends.
As of quarter-end, we had $700 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization for the period ending
June 30, 2025. Synchrony remains well positioned to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business
performance, market conditions, regulatory restrictions, and subject to our capital plan.
Turning to our outlook. Synchrony remains focused on executing our key strategic priorities and taking the
appropriate actions to reinforce our business performance for years to come, particularly our ability to deliver our
long-term financial target on average over time.
We have been closely monitoring our portfolio and believe that both our credit actions and the PPPCs are
performing in line with our expectations. With the first quarter of our PPPCs in effect, we are experiencing slightly
lower paper statement fee income than expected, with stronger enrollment in eBill. We're also experiencing less
customer attrition than expected, which is a testament to the value propositions of the products we offer. We will
continue to track the financial and operational impact on our customers, partners, and portfolios to determine,

alongside our partners, whether any refinements to our strategies are warranted to achieve our shared objectives
of sustainable, risk-adjusted growth at our targeted long-term returns.
As a reminder, specifically related to the framework around the pending Late Fee rule change and our PPPCs,
there continues to be uncertainty regarding the timing and outcome of Late Fee-related litigation that was filed in
March, the potential changes in consumer behavior that could occur as a result of Late Fee rule change, and any
potential changes in consumer behavior in response to the PPPCs we and the broader industry have
implemented as a result of the new rule. Outcomes and actual performance related to any of these uncertainties
could impact our outlook.
With that framework, let's turn to our outlook for the remainder of 2024. We expect the consumer to continue to
manage their spending which, when combined with our credit actions, should result in low-single-digit decline in
purchase volume for the fourth quarter. We continue to expect payment rates to moderate which, when combined
with the purchase volume expectations, should contribute to low-single-digit growth in ending loan receivables
compared to last year. Given that the Late Fee rule was not implemented on October 1, as assumed in our
previous outlook, and the continued uncertainty with regard to Late Fee litigation, we assume the Late Fee rule
will not become effective in 2024.
As a result, we expect net interest income to remain sequentially flat as the impacts of our PPPCs are offset by
seasonally higher reversals. Other income is expected to remain consistent with the third quarter level. RSA will
continue to align program and company performance and should decrease sequentially on a dollar basis and as a
percentage of average loan receivables, reflecting the net impact of seasonally higher net charge-offs on flat
revenue. Other expense is expected to increase sequentially with the seasonally higher growth. And from a credit
perspective, we expect delinquencies to follow seasonality in the fourth quarter. We also continue to expect the
second half 2024 net charge-off rate will be lower than the first half.
Lastly, we continue to expect our year-end 2024 reserve rate to be generally in line with the year-end 2023 rate.
Given these assumptions, Synchrony expects to deliver fully diluted earnings per share between $8.45 and $8.55
for the full year 2024. The approximate $0.80 improvement from the midpoint of our prior full-year EPS outlook
reflects a combination of factors. First, the removal of our assumption that the Late Fee rule we'll be implementing
on October 1, 2024, and therefore also the removal of the related benefit from the RSA offset.
Second, the impact of our PPPCs and the increase in RSA associated with those changes. And finally, strong
performance of our core business as we enter the fourth quarter. In summary, Synchrony has continued to deliver
on key strategic priorities that matter most to our stakeholders. We remain confident in the measures we've taken
thus far to strengthen our business in an evolving environment and believe we're well positioned to drive resilient,
risk-adjusted returns over the long term.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Brian for his closing thoughts.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning, everyone.

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Good morning, Ryan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Brian, maybe you could unpack the NII guy for us a little bit. I understand 4Q is seasonally lower from reversals,
as you highlighted, but how did the PPPCs fit in, along with your liability-sensitive position, which I don't think you
highlighted in your comments, and then I guess just given forward curve expectations outside of seasonality, do
you expect the NIM to have a continued upward bias over the next several quarters? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, thanks, Ryan. So when you think about NII sequentially as you step into the fourth quarter, the first, when
you think about the trends that are into delinquency and the units falling into delinquency, dollars assessed on
Late Fees should be down in 4Q versus 3Q. You combine that with higher reversals, that is essentially offsetting
the positivity you should see and you will see on interest income and the benefit that we see in interest expense.
So it kind of washes out in the quarter more just a function of how the favorability from delinquency is impacting
Late Fees.
As you start to think out, again, net interest margin for a second, you should continue to see the interest
component relative to the PPPCs as well as the raw rate as payment rates decline, increase in guide the NIM
higher. And you should also see a benefit of interest expense that will lag a little bit because of the reset of the
debt stack, particularly in the CDs that happens over the first half of the year. So there's generally more tailwinds

as you think about margin as you move into next year, but it's going to be a little bit lagged given the reset of CDs
in the first half of the year, both of which happened in the second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. And then as my follow-up question, your outlook for credit calls for delinquencies to follow seasonality, I
guess first you expect losses to do the same. And then in terms of delinquencies following seasonality, like what
does that mean for the trajectory of losses into 2025? And if they do follow seasonality, can losses move back
below 6% into next year? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. So, Ryan, we'll be back in January to talk really, really about next year. But I think here's a couple things I
would think about credit as a whole. First, there's probably four points that I'd raise. Number one, the delinquency
trends themselves. We're seeing strong entry rate, which is better than the pre-pandemic period, which is
continuing to benefit the flow into delinquency. We're seeing early stage delinquency really being stable as far as
its performance month on month. And then we're seeing some improvement in the last several months in late
stage collections, which are positive. So I think delinquency trends are doing fairly well. When you think about that
relative to seasonality, last several months we've actually been low to mid-single digits better than seasonality
when you look at 2017 to 2019 period. So that's a favorable trend that continues to go back, continue to go back
the last several months.
Again, I think I've highlighted publicly the vintage performance both of the second half of 2023, the first half of
2024, albeit very early. It's trending better than the 2018 vintages. And again, I think you can see both in the
purchase volume and the new account origination, most certainly the credit actions are having some effect there,
which I think bolsters credit as we move back through. Our underwriting is designed to give us that 5.5% to 6%.
So the intention would be that we would get back to that point. Again, we're moving down. You can see in the
slides that the year-over-year growth in delinquencies, both 30-plus and 90-plus continue to decline. So again,
tracking to our expectations as we move through the remainder part of 2024.

Terry Ma Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey, thank you. Good morning. So you called out a 30 basis point year-over-year increase in loan yields from
PPPCs, lower payment rates, and offset by interest reversals. Any way you can kind of quantify each of those
components and maybe just help us think about how that PPPC component kind of grows into next year?

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 16-Oct-2024
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, you know, Terry, we're not going to break out the individual components of the PPPCs by line items, but
most certainly the benefit is flowing through on the interest yield line, number one. It is mapped a little bit when
you think sequentially given the gain in the second quarter on the Visa shares, but clearly it's showing up in other
income. Again, this is the first full quarter that we have the first phase of the CITs in. We continue to expect that to
build into next year. I think when we come back in January, we'll try to provide a little bit more view on that. I think
when you take a step back, Terry, the important thing, and I highlighted it in my prepared remarks, is the actions
we've taken have generally been in line with our expectations. There's a positivity in the fact that customer
attrition is not as been high as our expectations.
Now, again, that would have had a reserve release of negative from a financial perspective, but it's really better
from a customer standpoint as they recognize the value propositions of our cards. We did highlight paper
statements were a little bit lower than expectations, partially due to softeners, partially due to our accounts being
a little bit lower than expectations, but all in all good. Adoption of eBill and our customers' willingness to change
behavior and do that has been positive. So when we look at that, generally speaking, it aligns. So even though
there's a little bit less customer attrition, that generally means the core is performing a little bit better. So, as we sit
here today, we are feeling good about where we are, but we'll continue to watch customer behavior and we'll
certainly watch the market. A lot of issuers have already started to implement changes as this rule comes
effective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry Ma Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Got it. That's helpful. And then just to follow up on credit, it seems credit performance is more or less performing
in line with your expectations. But as I look at the charge-off rate for this year, it's running somewhat north of 6%. I
don't want to tie it to your initial guide, but maybe just talk about how credit performance has evolved relative to
kind of what you expected coming into this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. The way I think about it, Terry, is we took some actions really in the late first quarter, early second quarter,
again, to try to set up and protect ourselves against any deterioration that could happen late this year or into next
year. So we took those actions. Well, certainly, I think you've seen some of the purchase volume, which is slightly
lower than our expectations. That unfortunately has an impact on the denominator which brings the rate a little bit
higher than what you think about. But, again, I think the fact that we're not taking broad-based actions today gives
us some credit, some confidence in credit, and we'll certainly – you've heard my points with Ryan a little bit earlier
around the four things that we looked at to say, hey listen, we feel good about where we are as we enter into the
fourth quarter.

Hi. Good morning. Brian, you mentioned some improvement over the last few months in late-stage collections. I
was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that, if that's just kind of mix, catch up, and generally speaking, is
it harder to execute on collections today versus prior?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yes. Thank you. Good morning, Don. Let me start with the latter part of your question. Is it harder to collect
today? Most certainly, I think if you look at this versus a number of years ago, most certainly making customer
contacts is a little bit tougher, but that's where we've expanded, and through the pandemic, investing in digital
collections, investing in other forms and to other channels which we can connect with the customer in order to
kind of get those collections done, such as tax and things like that. So it is a little bit tougher. I think it's a game
where you have to deploy more products than you do have to do just get more collectors on the phone.
And most certainly, the rules have evolved where the number of collections you can make to someone have
declined. But I think we've adapted to that. I think when you think about the late stage for a second, when your
early stage has deteriorated quite a bit, what flows into the back potentially has the ability to be slightly better and
able to collect. So while I look at the late stage, it is still performing worse than 2019.
In 2020, the pre-pandemic period, it has started to improve more recently, which we take as optimistic with regard
to performance. But, again, it is worse than what it was. And you would expect a little bit of that. If you have very
positive entry rate into delinquency, what flows in is a little bit tougher to collect. So we would have anticipated
both early stage and late stage to be worse. But right now in the last, I would say, several months, we have seen
a little bit of improvement in that late stage collections.

Got it. My follow-up just I know there is a lot of concern around the low end. It seems like your customers in the
low end are kind of managing, changing behavior, continuing to change behavior. But it doesn't seem like it's sort
of accelerating in terms of a pressure point. Is that fair?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, I think it is absolutely fair. I mean, we look at it in a couple of different ways. When you look at payment
rate, people making payments, when we look at the trends by credit grade, which if you say that somewhat aligns
with income decile, you're seeing more the movement in the prime, so that [ph] 660 to 780 (00:31:26) range,
you're seeing a little bit more movement there into min pay. You are not really seeing as much movement of the
non-prime in there. I want to say, the movement into min pay is about a point difference on the prime, and it was
half of that in the non-prime. So we're not seeing stress when it comes to payment.
I think when you look at the K-shaped recovery, clearly affordability has impacted some of the lower-end
consumer, and they've pulled back spending and they're managing fairly well. So I think when we look at those
two combined, we don't see stress in the consumer. We see them actually doing somewhat rational things right

now. So it's more normalization. But again, when you still look back against the prime customers, they are paying
their rates still above the 2019 level. So we don't necessarily see signs of stress in the low-end today.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, TD Securities (USA) LLC
Great. So, Brian, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the slowdown in spending volume and sort of
separated between the impacts of kind of your own tightening consumer preferences and then perhaps also the
policy changes. One of the questions we've gotten is, do you think, I know you said that attrition wasn't affected
by that, but what about spending volume? So those three factors. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Thanks. Yeah. First of all, good morning, Moshe. Thanks for the question. So let me start where you ended.
When you look at the actions which we took in the portfolio with regards to pricing changes and the like, the
positive news is we're able to have a control group in which we tested against that. So when we look at volume
changes between the people who received CITs and those who didn't receive the CITs, there's not a material
difference. So, we somewhat have a base to say that the actions having here created solid attrition that we're not
aware of. So that's one, I think, the latter part of your question.
I think when you look at the purchase volume in and of itself, what you see is, most certainly across the board,
almost transaction values coming down. So the consumer is trading down a bit. We see that, and I used the
examples, mattresses, where the frequency maybe hasn't moved down as much, but the average transaction
value's moved down.
As consumers say, listen, I'm willing to purchase a mattress but then, again, I'm not willing to spend $4,000. I'm
going to go down to something at $2,500. And we've seen that across the board in retailers. And I think you see it,
generally speaking, across the board. I mean, in discretionary items, even in our health and wellness business,
you see it in cosmetics, in LASIK, things that can be deferred. Now that's a short-term impact. Most certainly that
will create a tailwind at some point as both those types of procedures don't go away. And you're right, some of the
actions we took, we had a modest impact on purchase volume, a more meaningful impact on new accounts, in
order to make sure that the origination of the books are at risk-adjusted returns that are attractive to us.

Maybe to kind of – at a high level for either Brian, as you think about the underlying economic environment, we've
been in a period where wage growth has exceeded inflation, although the consumer still feels kind of pressured

and is still in that process, as you pointed out, of trading down. When you think about the sort of things that you
are looking for to try and jump-start or reverse some of those tightenings, what are the things that you'd be looking
for kind of from a macro standpoint? Maybe talk a little bit about that. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, Moshe, maybe I'll start on this one. Look, I think to Brian's point, the consumer is still in pretty good shape.
The trends that we're seeing are pretty similar across the industry. Inflation is having an impact. But I think, to
your point, the strong labor market is definitely helping to offset some of that pressure. I think consumers are
slowing spend, but they're doing it in a very kind of rational, disciplined way. We actually like the fact that we can
see that they're managing to a budget. They're navigating the higher cost of goods. This isn't a new trend. We
started to see it earlier this year. You're seeing it a little bit more broad based right now, but not in a concerning
way. I think from a credit perspective, this is exactly what we wanted to see.
Some of that is pulled back on behalf of the consumer. And some of that is just the actions that we took. But
again, I think similar to credit, you're just seeing spend kind of move back to a normalized level. I think when credit
levels off and you start to see some stability, there's still a lot of uncertainty out there. And I think when those
clouds start to clear, then you start to get back to what we would consider more normal growth in the business,
driving new accounts back to levels that would be similar to prior to this year.

Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just to close the loop on credit, Brian Wenzel. Maybe you could talk about the
reserve rate trend line, maybe how we should think about the direction into next year. I know you're not giving
guidance for next year. I know you'll be giving guidance by year-end, but like, just to think about when we migrate
back to some normalized levels of reserve rate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Thank you and good morning, Sanjay. I think the guidance we'd kind of give you is that the reserve rate at
the end of this year will generally be in line with the reserve rate at the end of last year, which was 10.26% or
10.3%. I know people are probably focusing on the term generally. Obviously, when you look at the year-end
number, and that's a big seasonal factor, it's just really how the receivable develops and how it plays out. I think
most certainly, I've given you some of the delinquency trends that builds into the quantitative model. And, again, I
think we've seen – while it's been a little bit choppy, the macroeconomic environment being a little bit more stable,
we're pleased that the Federal Reserve did lower rates. So, again, I think as we exit out of this year, generally in

line with last year, I think you kind of have some indication how you think about the loss trajectory. And most
certainly, I don't think we see anything today that says to us, we're not going to continue to march back towards
that day one CECL.
And most certainly, as you see, the delinquency levels which are slightly above where we were in the pre-
pandemic period, where when you compare it back, both 30-plus and 90-plus, as that moves back towards
normal, we would expect the reserve rate to continue to [ph] slow (00:38:30) down, absent mix shifts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, great. And maybe just on the CFPB Late Fee rules, I guess Brian Wenzel, you talked a lot about sort of the
behavior of the consumer, but has anything changed in terms of when you expect to fully mitigate the impact to
the extent it goes in sometime next year? Then maybe if it doesn't happen, like, how should we think about the
game plan if it doesn't go into effect? Do you claw back some of the changes that you've made or do other
things? I'm just trying to think through the implications there. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, let me start in and then see if Brian has any additional comments. To your first part of your question,
Sanjay, it doesn't really impact the point of neutrality, right? It really goes from the starting point to the neutrality
point what's the trough level, depending upon when the Late Fee rule kind of comes into play. So I don't think it's
necessarily one where we look back and say, the early performance we've seen changes that exit rate of
neutrality based upon our analysis. So I think that piece of it remains in place.
With regard to when the rule may become effective, we'll probably do that sometime, either in the fourth quarter or
January, if we have more information, when we have a better assumption with regard to when that rule does go in
play. We are operating as a company, and most certainly, the administration has taken the view that they want
the Late Fee rule in, and we're planning as if it's going to go in. It's just the point of entry of when it goes in. So,
your question really around, is there a clawback? People use the term rollback.
As a company, we haven't spent any real time thinking about that. Again, we view it's going to come into effect in
some way, and if it doesn't, then we have to have a high degree of certainty that it wouldn't go back into play. And
then it's really a conversation, for those that share the economic impact of this. And then for our properties, we'd
have to do that assessment. But, again, we haven't spent a lot of time in this. We believe the rule will go in effect,
and we're planning as a company to execute that. I don't know, Brian, if you have any further comments you want
to.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, no, I think, look, we had the plan as if there was going to be an $8 Late Fee, because it takes time for these
offsets to bleed in. We work with our partners on that. It's hard to speculate on whether $8 actually goes into
effect, or they remove the safe harbor. There is a lot of different ways that this could play out, but we're prepared
for all of those events. And in terms of rolling anything back, I think, like Brian said, that's a discussion that we
have with our partners, just like when we rolled out the initial pricing actions, and we operate very transparently
with them, and we did when we rolled out the pricing changes, and we'll do that depending on the eventual
outcome of the Late Fee. Again, our goal hasn't changed here. We're trying to protect our partners and continue
to approve the same customers that we do today.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe to start, I just wanted to turn to net interest margins for a little bit.
How do you expect them to perform in a declining rate environment? I ask because your portfolio is a little
different than some of your large peers with a little bit more fixed rate in it, so just maybe if you can walk through
the moving pieces there and also, any deposit beta assumptions you'd be willing to share?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, good morning, Mihir and thanks for your question. So, I think when you think about our framework for net
interest margin, I'm going to put aside a little bit of the ALR mix and I'll come back to that at the end. I think when
you first think about the interest in fee component yield piece of this, you should be getting a little bit of a benefit
as the impact of prime rate movements for that portion of the business to flow through, right because Prime lags
the way which we bill it. So, hopefully we get a benefit on the floating rate component of it. Most certainly as
payment rate continues to come down, the revolve rate component should rise. So those two should create
tailwinds inside the interest and fee side of the NIM component.
I think when you think about the funding side from both the investment portfolio, as well as the interest expense,
obviously, we're going to have to follow market. Traditionally, we've lagged the market a little bit from a digital
banking perspective. I think what you've seen here in the third quarter is that digital banks have been a little bit
more proactive at lowering rates earlier than normal given their probably funding needs. So, we followed them
down.
So, I think that creates an additional tailwind. When you think about that for a second, you have to break it out
between the high yield savings component which has a more immediate impact. But, again, it's probably 40% of
our retail deposits. And then you get to 60% of CDs, a bulk of which will reprice in the first half and will certainly
more than, I want to say 75% reprice entirely during next year, but a bulk of it really reprice in the first half of the
year, a lot of which is in the second quarter, given the way in which we originated certificates this year. So, again,
that lags a little bit on some of the earlier Fed movements, but should be able to capture that rate movement
down as we move back in.
And the last thing I bring in is ALR is a little bit of a wildcard when it comes to NIM. I look at it today, if we're
paying someone 4.3% on a high yield savings, getting 4.9% from the Fed, it's a positive economic position for the
company. So, I'm not necessarily sure I want to take liquidity down at that point, because we're going to need it as
we begin to exit and grow here from this period of time. So, again, if that turns more negative or flat, then we'll
15

rethink how much liquidity we carry. So, those are the moving pieces, I think, here to kind of give you some sense
on how you should think about NIM.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Okay. No, that's very helpful. Thank you. And then maybe switching back to purchase volumes just following up
on, I think, Moshe's questions. Just wanted to make sure I understand, what gives you confidence that purchase
volume declines, I guess, or purchase volumes are stabilized here at this down low single-digit level? And
relatedly, are there certain platforms which you look at which are leading indicators of where purchase volumes
are going or consumer financial health? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, obviously, we look at the trends daily and we watch daily sales and see where they flow and watch the,
what I would call, a counter-adjusted year-over-year view and a kind of daily year-over-year view. So, I think we
try to gain insight to see whether or not we see trends, and I think we see stability where we are. Brian mentioned
earlier, again, we started to see a decline really in the second quarter and accelerated into the third quarter, but
now it's somewhat stabilized. Again, holiday is always an interesting period of time, how promotional it will be and
which retailers win or lose there. So, that's a little bit of a wild card, but I think generally speaking, when we look at
the spending behavior patterns, broadly speaking, in the aggregate, we don't see things that are continuing to
slow.
I think when we further break that down by what I would call the credit grade pieces of it, it's been fairly consistent
where your higher credit grades continue to be higher than your lower credit grades with regard to what they're
consuming. So, I think we look at that and say, okay, there is some stability heading into the holiday season. I
think to your point, is there a platform that [indiscernible] (00:46:33)? I think you have to look at and say, is there
platforms that are much more discretionary or there are ones that aren't, right. So, I think you're going to see ones
that have more discretionary spend may be a little bit more down than others. You still see strength in certain
parts of the portfolio inside of the platform. So, example, vets performing better than other pieces inside Health &
Wellness, so that should continue.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
I think the other thing is if you just go back and think about the two years prior to this we're coming off of record
levels of consumer spend, not just in our business but across the industry, and I think we all knew at some point
inflation was going to catch up to the consumer, particularly at the lower income levels, and we're starting to see
that. So, a slowdown is not necessarily a bad thing in this environment.

Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mark DeVries with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark DeVries Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah, thanks. You mentioned earlier that you started to see others implement changes. Just interested in your
thoughts on kind of what you've learned from that, whether you've decided you need to recalibrate to remain
competitive. It doesn't really sound like it just given the low attritions, or alternatively whether you kind of missed
an opportunity to change terms with some borrowers that you viewed as more marginal?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, thank you. Good morning. So again, we maintain a competitive screen of those people who are in the
partnership-based business. You don't necessarily look at broad-based general-purpose cards who have a
different competitive dynamic relative to their value propositions, but when we look at people who have
implemented changes in the partnership side from a competitive standpoint, they generally have done similar
types of things relative to APRs. Some have done things with paper statements. So, I think we look at that
landscape, and I think we feel comfortable with the actions that we've taken. And, again, we look more so to how
our portfolio performs, our relationships with our merchants, and the value proposition we have with our
customers.
Clearly, the pricing of a credit product has to resonate with the value proposition that they get. If those two are out
of equilibrium, you're going to have a situation where the consumer is not going to want your product. So, it's
more we're focused on ourselves. I think when we look at the competitive screen, I think we think about it as being
in line with, and we're not necessarily an outlier relative to our peers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark DeVries Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay, got it. Thanks. And then on the guidance for reserve coverage at the end of the year, it implies a bigger
kind of step down seasonally than we saw the last couple of years. Could you just talk about what's driving that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Most certainly, I think when you think about the reserve coverage rate, it's generally a forward-looking view on
how you think losses will be over a reasonable period of time, number one. And two, are there other things that
aren't in your quantitative model that you need to account for, macroeconomic being one, I think as we think about
the end of the year and think about the lost content through the delinquency we see today, and how we feel about
the macro, I think we feel comfortably it's only going to be in line with what we had the end of last year.

Operator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from John Hecht with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. Good morning, guys. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Most have been asked and answered. I'm
wondering, the Health & Wellness segment always been a good contributor to growth. And I'm just wondering, are
you seeing similar kind of spend trends from a discretionary, non-discretionary perspective in that category? Is
there anything else to call out there that might be different from kind of the rest of the portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, John, let me start on this and then hand it to Brian, I think. Look, the Health & Wellness segment has been
a big area of focus for us over the last couple of years we think. We've got the right to win in that space. It's a
huge market, $400 billion, roughly. We've seen a little bit of a pullback recently, but if you look over a little bit
longer period of time, we've definitely been able to accelerate the growth there. We think we've got a great value
proposition. We've got a well-recognized brand. Actually, we get the best customer NPS and customer
satisfaction scores with those products. So, we feel great about how we're positioned in Health & Wellness. Not
surprisingly, where you've seen some pullback more broadly across the business has been in, bigger ticket
discretionary purchases. And you're seeing some of that in the CareCredit space.
Again, nothing concerning from our perspective. You're still seeing, largely better growth there than you are. And
the rest of the business is based on the investments that we've made to date.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, just maybe to add a little bit more color. I think when you look inside the Health & Wellness sales platform
and think about the diversity, again, I highlighted pet. Pet is up 4% year-over-year. So, there are pieces of that
portfolio that are doing well, cosmetics down 6%, etcetera. You see some things and we talked about the
consumer being discretionary, some of your high ticket dental, which is more of a deferrable expense for some,
that's down. So, I think you look at that, the positive news we take out of that platform, again, the reason the card
is up to 65%, which is up 500 basis points versus last year.
So again, Brian highlighted the net promoter score in the likability of this product, the value proposition and the
brand of this product resonates with those consumers. So again, we continue to see the use and most certainly
it's an area where I think when people start to lean back into some of the more discretionary type procedures that
are non-medical that will begin to see that lift. And again, having 10% loan growth year-over-year is still a very
strong part of the portfolio and part of our company strategy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay, great, thanks. And then I know you guys are preparing for a variety of outcomes with the Late Fee
backdrop. I'm wondering, can you give us just sort of an update on where it stands on litigation. Is there anything
on the docket or on the calendar that we should be looking to that might represent an event that could give us a
little bit more color about what's going to happen there?

Yeah. And, John, what I'd say is there was a hearing that was held at the end of August. Most certainly, right now,
we're waiting for the – and the plaintiffs are waiting for the decision with regard to the motion that's in front of the
court, which is both about venue and the standing of one of the plaintiffs in the case. There's not a timetable for
that district court to respond to that motion. So, we're awaiting for that. You then go into whether or not one of the
parties, whoever's on the other side of that, whether or not they would take action with the Fifth Circuit to appeal it
or whether or not the next motion would be around the injunction itself or whether or not the injunction itself
should be lifted from there. So again, I think we're in a waiting game. I think it's fair to say that anyone who's tried
to predict this has been wrong, so we're not in the prediction business today. So, we continue to operate the
business as if the Late Fee rule will go in, and we'll obviously await what the court says about the litigation. But
obviously, we feel good that the merits of litigation there, but really, it's inherently uncertain.

I mean, John, if you think about it, we're prepared and our entire plan was enacted to offset what is the worst
case, which was $8 by October 1. Obviously, that has come and gone. It is difficult to speculate on when this is
actually going to become effective. But if you think about it as, all the pricing actions that we rolled out, policy
changes, et cetera, we're done assuming an October 1 implementation date and $8. And so, as we kind of buy
time, that's helpful from that perspective. But again, we didn't have the luxury of waiting. We acted very quickly
here and rolled out the pricing changes. And they're performing as expected.

Jeffrey Adelson Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. I just wanted to circle back on the loan growth outlook
and some of the credit actions you've taken. It sounds like, if I'm hearing it right, you maybe have slowed the
intensity of these credit actions you took earlier in the year. So, just, assuming you keep that stance in place
today, does that mean this slowing trend you're looking for, exiting the year, kind of at this low-single-digit growth
rate, maybe can reverse itself into next year? Or what would it take for that to reaccelerate and how should we
think eventually about the timeline to getting back to that high-single-digit kind of long-term growth rate you look
for?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Thanks, Jeff, for the question, and good morning. The first thing – I just want to clarify. When we take
action, a lot of it's strategy actions that aren't necessarily a single point in time. So, for instance, some of the
actions we took around debt consolidation loans are student loans. To some degree, if that strategy trips today,
action happens. So, they're ongoing. They're not new actions. They are the same actions, just whether [ph] an

account (00:56:25) is applicable to that action. So, again, the actions that we are taking today are more
idiosyncratic based upon a partner channel or product performance relative to the risk-adjusted return.
I think when you think about how credit actions play out and how the consumer plays out, Brian highlighted
earlier, most certainly, we're in a period of time that's a little bit more transitory, right? So, you have affordability
issues for some of the lower-end – lower-income consumers. Hopefully with interest rates coming down and
inflation coming down, that abates a bit and takes some of that pressure off. Remember, a lot of the pressure on
credit today stems not necessarily from economics of the consumer, but more that the fact that too much credit
has been put in the system in the 2021 to early 2023 year that has to work its way through the system.
I think as that begins to recede, which I think you're seeing in certain issuers across the industry, that gives us a
little bit of a tailwind, which says that we can begin to unwind some of the restricted credit actions that we took
over the past two years, potentially in the latter part of 2025. But, again, that's going to be based upon
performance. So, I don't think this is a long-term trend on growth. It's probably a good thing in this period where
the credit is a little bit more uncertain, but obviously, our long-term framework and our models are built to deliver
7% to 10% loan receivable growth.

And as my follow-up, I know you're not sizing the PPPC drivers in the lines, but could you maybe talk about how
you feel you're tracking versus that initial $650 million to $700 million you were talking about earlier in the year,
and just maybe remind us of any of the PPPC changes you're holding off on at this point until the late Fee rule
comes through – or if it comes through, rather.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. The way I think about it, Jeff, it's generally in line with, as I talk about, customer attrition being lower. That's
a swing between BAU bucket and this bucket. So again, I'd sit back and say, if you were to take a step back and
go to [ph] 10,000 feet (00:58:38), I think you'd say, the PPPC actions generally are in line with and [indiscernible]
(00:58:48) performing a little bit better. But, again, the point I brought up earlier, the point of neutrality, as we look
at the analysis, hasn't changed for us. It's really just the trough. So, when does the rule come effective and our
trajectory to there? But the point hasn't pushed out. I know we haven't really talked about that because we want to
be able to understand when that rule goes in place. And as soon as it does, we will certainly provide that
neutrality point. But, again, things are performing generally in line, and of course, performed a little bit better than
our expectations, which I think is reflected in the outlook on page 12.

Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was afraid Jeff was going to run out the clock on me. Look, I realize
that CECL reserve is a thought exercise, and I realize that guidance on your reserve rate is a thought exercise on

a thought exercise. I'm curious, though, if we look at the third quarter reserve rate, it's basically at a cyclical high.
And you're guiding for the fourth quarter back to 2023 levels. You basically have 16 days of incremental
information and it feels like you've gone from a very cautious outlook to a more or less cautious outlook. What's
changed or what mechanically is driving the sort of decline that Mark DeVries had pointed out as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, good morning Rick and I'm glad that we run the clock out on, you got to answer, ask your question. Simply
put, it really goes back to the denominator. Your loss content right now is big, right? I mean you can most
certainly in your model rule what the fourth quarter loss number should look like and what the first quarter dollar
losses should look like. It really just becomes the denominator. So, I don't view as saying that we're trying to be
any more cautious or guide to something that says we fundamentally see a different credit trajectory. More so it's
just more the mechanics of the calculation of taking your reserve over an end-of-period loan number.
