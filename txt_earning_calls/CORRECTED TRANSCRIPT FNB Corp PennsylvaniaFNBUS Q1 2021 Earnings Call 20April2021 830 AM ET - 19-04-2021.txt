Vincent J. Delie, Jr.
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you and welcome to our earnings call. Joining me today are Vince Calabrese, our Chief Financial Officer;
and Gary Guerrieri, our Chief Credit Officer. I'd like to open the call by expressing my appreciation to the entire
F.N.B. team who produced highly impressive results despite continued challenges presented by the pandemic.
First quarter net income totaled $91 million or $0.28 per share, resulting in an upper quartile return on tangible
common equity of 15%. I am so proud to state that the first quarter results are on par with pre COVID-19 levels.
An extraordinary accomplishment given the significant changes in interest rates and a less favorable economic
environment during the last 12 months.
Our company remains well capitalized with increased risk based capital ratios and an allowance for credit losses
excluding PPP loan at 1.57%. F.N.B. demonstrated strong fundamental performance. Its total revenue increased
both on a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis. We establish a new record for non-interest income at $83
million, supported by strength in mortgage banking, record wealth management and insurance revenues, and
solid contributions from capital markets.
During the quarter, we originated nearly $1 billion of PPP round 2 loan. On a linked-quarter basis. Tangible book
value per share increased $0.13 to $8.01 as we continue to our commitment to paying an attractive dividend by
declaring our quarterly common dividend of $0.12 last week, while executing on $36 million of share buybacks
during the quarter at an average price of $11.91. In addition, our CET 1 ratio increased to 10% as we continue to
prioritize our options for capital deployment in the manner that produces the highest risk adjusted return for our
shareholders.
Diligent expense management remains a top priority, and we are on track to meet this year's $20-million cost
savings target, completing our 3-year $60-million expense reduction initiative. The efficiency ratio totaled 58.7%,
improving 36 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2020, with both quarters reflecting seasonally elevated
expenses.
Today, I'll take a deeper dive into three areas discussed in our annual letter to shareholders where we've
successfully gained scale, strengthened our risk profile, and diversified our revenue streams. First, I will cover the
successful expansion of our fee-based businesses and how we've continually expanded our suite of value-added
products and services.
Next, I want to highlight F.N.B.'s new digital capabilities and provide updates about our de novo strategy within
the Clicks-to-Bricks initiative. Lastly, after Gary reviews asset quality and Vince provides details on financials, I
will wrap-up with a summary of how we differentiate ourselves and deliver value to all of our stakeholders.
One of the main areas we emphasized in our 2020 Annual Report was our goal of diversifying our overall revenue
mix. Over the last several years, we've been consistently growing value-added fee-based businesses, many of
which generated double-digit annual growth rates that have led to a more granular fee-based revenue stream.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
In what has been a challenging interest rate environment over the last 12 months, we have successfully
leveraged these investments that are fee-based businesses to mitigate net interest margin headwinds, specifically
through significant growth in capital markets, mortgage banking, wealth management, and insurance revenues.
During the first quarter of 2021 we've continued to build on last year's success as those businesses have
increased $16 million or 56% compared to the first quarter of 2020. If you recall, we laid out our long-term strategy
to invest and scale our fee-based businesses to offer core products and services to our clients, namely mortgage
banking and capital markets. As we transformed our footprint and expanded into attractive markets such as
Baltimore, Maryland, Washington D.C. and the Carolinas, F.N.B. continues to grow the scope and depth of client
relationships.
In 2021, we are adding capacity to mortgage banking operations and servicing as production levels continue to
set records each quarter. As of this week, mortgage pipelines are at record levels in relation to both production
and held for investment originations. Our mortgage banking business had a record breaking year in 2020 with
more than $3 billion in total production and $50 million in fee income. Even as rates have risen, we are confident
that a broader geography and a more favorable economic environment for purchase money mortgage loans will
support healthy production levels and become a greater portion of our total volume.
Turning to our capital markets platform, we've expanded our capabilities significantly through building our
syndications, derivatives and international banking platforms organically, with those businesses now contributing
revenues from just over $1 million to more than $30 million annually. Additionally, we have expanded the breadth
and reach of our capital markets platform with enhanced debt capital markets capabilities geared towards our
upper middle market and large corporate clients.
Looking ahead, we are also focusing on specific opportunities in public finance and other specialty verticals that
will provide broader revenue opportunities with the issuance of corporate and municipal debt. As we've advanced
our fee-based businesses, our consumer bank is making important decisions relative to evolving overall
consumer preferences and how we deliver products to our clients. Consumers can now utilize F.N.B. eStyle
checking designed to prevent overdraft and NSF fees completely.
F.N.B. continues to expand its digital capabilities through launching new products. We recently rolled out a
number of new features such as e-signature and offering credit scores, with plans for embedding the Solutions
Center e-store into our robust mobile application. This will provide clients with the opportunity to directly purchase
loan, products within the mobile application as well as deposit products. The next phase is to finalize our single
omni-channel online application so the customer can apply for multiple products with a single application while
utilizing our shopping cart experience.
Along with our digital investments, we continue to streamline elements of the physical delivery channel through
implementing dynamic appointment setting capabilities and a comprehensive data-driven sales management
platform to better identify value-added products and services when clients conduct business in the branch.
Additionally, we are focused on bringing the application process online for more of our loans and our other
consumer products in the coming quarters so that consumers are able to seamlessly manage and add F.N.B.
products and services using online or mobile channels, as we continue to make progress within applications for
end-to-end delivery of digital products and services.
In addition to investing in technology, we continue to make targeted investments in our physical delivery channel
to position our company for accelerated growth and efficiency. Charleston, South Carolina is an example of our

successful de novo strategy to enter a higher growth market. This year, we will have five retail branch locations
and a regional hub that permits us to offer a complete set of fee-based products, complementing the consumer
and commercial teams that are firmly established in the market.
Our South Carolina bankers were recruited from some of the largest financial institutions in the country. The
commercial team has originated more than $150 million in funded assets since inception, and the retail locations
ranked among the upper quartile of branches relative to their key performance indicators during 2020.
Looking ahead, near-term commercial pipelines are at an all-time high and South Carolina was the fastest
growing commercial market company-wide on a percentage basis for both full year 2020 and first quarter 2021.
There are many exciting things happening with our investments in de novo growth market and digital technology.
Another area we are proud of is our risk management and credit performance.
And with that, I will transition the call over to Gary to discuss our progress. Gary?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. We continued to see positive performance across our credit
portfolio during the first quarter of the year. Our key credit metrics improved across the board and remain at very
solid levels, with better-than-expected results across a number of consumer portfolios as well as the favorable
positioning of our commercial book, following the actions taken last quarter to proactively reduce exposure to the
most challenged industries.
I would now like to review some highlights for the quarter, followed by a brief overview of our current deferral
levels. The level of delinquency improved over the prior quarter to end March at 80 basis points, representing a
22 basis point improvement linked-quarter, which was driven by positive macroeconomic trends and some
seasonally lower past due levels in the consumer portfolio as is typical in the first quarter. Excluding PPP loan
volume, delinquency stands at 89 basis points.
The level of NPLs and OREO ended March at 65 basis points, an improvement of 5 bps on a linked-quarter basis,
while the non-GAAP level excluding PPP loans stands at 72 basis points. The improvement was largely driven by
a reduction in non-accrual loans of $12 million during the quarter, with nearly half of our NPLs continuing to pay
on a contractually current basis.
Net charge-offs for the first quarter came in at a very solid level of $7 million or 11 basis points annualized and 13
bps on a non-GAAP basis, with provision expense totaling $6 million, resulting in an ending March reserve
position at 1.42%. Excluding the PPP portfolio, the non-GAAP ACL stands at 1.57%, up 1 basis point over the
prior quarter.
Inclusive of the remaining acquired unamortized discount, our total reserve coverage stands at 1.78%, with our
NPL coverage position also remaining favorable at 230%, following the previously noted improvement in NPL
levels during the quarter.
I'd now like to provide you with a brief update on our loan deferral levels. At the end of March, our deferrals are
down to 1.2% of our core loan portfolio and the number of new requests from commercial borrowers have
essentially ceased at this point. We continue to monitor these smaller credits actively, as we have done
throughout the entire pandemic, with the expectation that the numbers will continue to reduce as the economy
opens up.

Additionally, we continue to track our portfolio mix and performance trends to stay ahead of any potentially
sensitive asset classes that could show signs of stress towards the tail end of the pandemic. As is consistent with
our approach to risk management, we will continue to proactively identify any potential areas of risk and take
action if opportunities arise that are strategically and financially beneficial to the company.
In closing, we are very pleased with the solid start to the year and the continued progress we've made in the book
to work down our limited exposure to the more sensitive industries. As the broader economy continues to evolve,
we are focused on managing our book through our core credit principles of disciplined underwriting across our
footprint, attentive risk management, and the proactive workout of credits to keep our portfolio well-positioned as
we look forward to the anticipated activity from an accelerating economy in the second half of the year.
I will now turn the call over to Vince Calabrese, our Chief Financial Officer, for his remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thanks, Gary, and good morning. Today I will discuss our financial results and some of our current expectations.
As noted on slide 5, first quarter EPS was solid at $0.28, up significantly on a year-over-year basis as the first
quarter of 2020 has significant reserve build at the onset of the pandemic. At a high level, results for the quarter
included record levels of non-interest income translating into revenue growth, well managed expenses and
significantly lower provision for loan losses given recent asset quality trends, partially offset by the continued
impact of this low interest rate environment.
Let's review the balance sheet on page 8. Average balances for total loans increased 8.3% on a year over year
basis and decreased 0.8% in the fourth quarter. On a spot basis for the first quarter of 2021, total loans were up
0.3% as PPP balances increased $330 million on a net basis with $900 million of round two PPP loans funded
during the quarter, partially offset by $500 million of PPP forgiveness.
Commercial line utilization rates remain at record lows in the low 30s, which translates into about a $0.5-billion in
funded balances at a normalized utilization rate. This level creates upside for loan growth as reflected in the
strength of our long range commercial pipelines, which are near all-time highs.
Turning to deposits, average deposits grew 19.3% on a year-over-year basis and increased 5.7% annualized on a
linked-quarter basis. On a spot basis for the first quarter of 2021, total deposits increased $1.2 billion or 16.9%
annualized, led by strong growth in non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing demand deposits, partially offset by
a managed decrease in time deposits. This continued deposit growth bolsters our ample liquidity and strengthens
our deposit mix with a loan to deposit ratio at 84%, with 33% of our deposits being non-interest-bearing at the end
of the quarter.
Turning to the income statement. Net interest income declined $11.5 million or 4.9% compared to the fourth
quarter. The reported net interest margin narrowed 12 basis points to 2.75% as higher average cash balances
were 6-basis point negative impact on the margin compared to last quarter. Additional drivers to the lower margin
were a 7-basis point reduction in PPP contribution and a 2-basis point reduction in the benefit from purchase
accounting on acquired loans.
Excluding these impacts, the underlying margin increased 5 basis points from the fourth quarter with benefits from
continuing to manage down interest-bearing deposit costs, which improved 12 basis points, to 31 basis points for

the quarter. With the cost of these deposits ending the quarter at 27 basis points on a spot basis, 4 basis points
lower than the average, we expect further reductions in our cost of funds moving forward.
Let's now look at non-interest income and expense on slides 10 and 11. Non-interest income totaled a record $83
million as mortgage banking income remained strong at $16 million with expanded gain on sale margins and
strong sold production volume that was up 69% on a year-over-year basis. Wealth management increased 14% in
the fourth quarter to record levels due to the expanded footprint and positive market impacts on assets under
management. Solid contributions from capital markets and insurance also supported the record fee income result
for the quarter.
Looking at slide 11, non-interest expense totaled $184.9 million, relatively flat with the prior quarter and year ago
quarter. On an operating basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, salaries and employee benefits increased
$2.7 million or 2.5%, primarily related to $5.6 million of expense in the first quarter of 2021 due to the timing of
normal seasonal long-term compensation recognition similar to last year's first quarter.
Occupancy and equipment on an operating basis increased $2.5 million or 8.1% due to investments in digital
technology, expansion in key growth markets across the footprint and seasonal expenses related to adverse
weather. Our CET1 ratio improved to an estimated 10%, up from 9.1% last March even with $75 million of
buyback over this period, reflecting F.N.B.'s strategy to optimize capital deployment.
Turning to our outlook, we expect reported net interest income to be generally flat from first quarter 2021 levels as
we expect a pickup in loan activity to be weighted toward the second half of the year and the net interest income
contribution from PPP to be similar to the first quarter. For the full year of 2021, our mid-single digit loan and
transaction deposit growth assumptions ex-PPP remain unchanged from our prior guidance. We expect continued
strong contributions in mortgage banking given the pipelines Vince mentioned, with total non-interest income
expected in the high $70-million range for the second quarter.
For provision, our current outlook is down from our expectations in January subject to loan origination activity in
the second half of the year. We are on track to achieve our expense savings target of $20 million for 2021 and
expect operating expenses for the second quarter to be down from seasonally higher expenses in the first quarter
based on our current forecasted level of mortgage commissions.
For the full year of 2021, we still expect revenues to be stable compared to 2020 and expenses to be down
slightly year-over-year. Lastly, we expect the full year effective tax rate to be around 19%, assuming no change to
the statutory corporate tax rate of 21%.
I will now turn the call back to Vince.

Vincent J. Delie, Jr.
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thanks, Vince. We've covered a lot of ground today, and I want to wrap up with how successfully executing our
long-term growth strategy differentiates F.N.B. moving forward. First and foremost, F.N.B. is in a unique position
as a regional bank with a top market share in many attractive growth markets across a broad geography. Given
this position, our local product specialist and decision makers dedicated to serving our markets can provide a high
touch, relationship-based personal service level that consumers and middle market borrowers prefer.
We have an exceptionally talented team of bankers, the necessary funding, and optimal capital levels to pursue
relationships across the footprint to accomplish our growth objectives and provide our shareholders with pure

leading return on tangible common equity. As an organization, we've consistently and prudently invested in
technology, data analytics and risk management to better the customer experience, improve profitability, and
enable F.N.B. to maintain superior asset quality throughout varying cycles while maintaining a top quartile
efficiency ratio relative to peers.
We've been recognized for our mobile and digital offerings that have improved the customer experience by
positioning the company for shifting preferences and providing F.N.B. with a sustained competitive advantage.
Our culture of risk management and disciplined approach to underwriting a local decision making allows us to
maintain our lower risk profile. We are unique in that we can maintain a lower level of cumulative losses while
driving mid to high single-digit loan growth because of our diversified granular approach to credit.
As it relates to the quality of people and strength of our culture, F.N.B. has received more than 65 Greenwich
Excellence and Best Brand Awards, including specific recognition for excellence in client advisory services and for
its commercial banking client experience during the past decade. The company further built on these honors in
2020 with three consecutive quarters of recognition as a Greenwich Associates Standout Commercial Bank Amid
Crisis for our COVID-19 response. And just last week, F.N.B. was named to Forbes 2021 ranking of the world's
best banks based on consumer feedback. F.N.B. is 1 of only 75 banks in the United States to be recognized on
the list, which includes a total of 500 banks from around the globe.
In closing, we are focused on continuing our commitment to advance our market positions by gaining scale and
operational efficiency, and by cultivating meaningful lasting relationships with our clients and communities while
simultaneously creating value for our shareholders. Again, I want to say thank you to all of our employees for their
continued dedication and we'll now turn the call back to the operator for questions. Operator?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
In terms of the excess liquidity in the books, I wondered if you could talk a little bit about how you manage that in
the near term. Are you starting to see enough of these deposits sticking around more than transitory where you
can start redirecting into the securities book for some yield? Or is there enough loan growth potential that you
seek to keep that – things to keep that powder dry?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I would say during the quarter it fell quite a bit as we put in the comments there, ending the quarter around
$2.5 billion. I think as we look ahead and as we commented on, we do expect loan activity to pick up in the
second half of the year. We do have $0.5 billion of Federal Home Loan Bank advances that are maturing this
year, that'll use some of the cash. We have started to reinvest the cash flows from the securities portfolio. We
actually grew it a little bit if you exclude the T-bills that we had in there, $600 million at the end of the year.
So, we're reinvesting the cash flows there now that the rates are at least north of 1, up about 50 basis points from
where they were earlier in the quarter. So as far as the securities portfolio, kind of around that same dollar level
as we ended the quarter is kind of the current expectation. So really a combination of the maturing advances and
then the loan activity picking up and using up some of that cash.
We don't want to go along and really well up the investment portfolio. We don't think that that makes sense. The
cash flow from that portfolio was pretty significant over the next 12 months. There's $1.4 billion that's going to kind
of cash flow over the next 12 months. So depending on where rates go, we will be opportunistic if rates – the 10-
year rate moves significantly during the quarter. If there's opportunity and we see things we like, we would invest
more than the cash flows. But there's a good opportunity to continue to remit that portfolio as we go forward in
here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, great. And then just secondly – lastly, I'm just wondering if you can talk a little bit about your updated
thoughts on M&A. We've seen a lot of it so far in the industry in 2021. You guys talked about the strong pipeline. It
sounds like there's plenty of organic opportunity. But just wondering how M&A could fit into the strategy and what
that's – what a deal could look like.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. Well, I think, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we are very well-positioned unlike some other
banks and mid-sized groups, we're spread across a fairly broad geography. We're in a number of high growth
markets. We've had very good success with our de novo expansion strategy particularly in Charleston. And now
we're starting to see some good progress in Washington D.C.
Obviously, as we move forward, M&A at some point is inevitable one way or another, but I feel pretty strongly
about where we are from a performance perspective. I think that we've posted some very solid orders. We've got
some very good measured growth. We've got very solid pipelines going into the second half of the year. We've
said repeatedly that we felt that we'll see a surge in demand towards the second half of the year. It's starting to
play out in the pipelines that we have.
In the event that an opportunity were to present itself from an acquisition perspective, obviously, we've been very
disciplined in the past and we've done a very good job of executing. There's a large group of people here that

have tremendous amount of experience with integration and performing due diligence. But our first focus is to try
to drive organic growth through the platform that we've created both digitally and in those high growth markets
that we've expanded into. We think there's substantial upside for the shareholders as we execute our longer-term
strategic plan. That's one.
Two is we're obviously looking at opportunities to deploy capital. And I think as we continue to grow, and I think
one good example is – I am shifting gears here a little bit. But one good example is actually our incentive
compensation plan. The LTIP awards themselves align our interests with the shareholders, where we grow
tangible book value per share and continue to pay an attractive dividend. So internal capital growth is an
important factor. And return on tangible common equity, as we grow our capital base, performing at a higher level
by taking cost out and driving returns up is also part of our short and long-term incentive plan.
So I know that's a really long answer, but, obviously, we're capable of doing acquisition. It's still not a principal
focus of ours. And if something comes along that's attractive, that works in market, there's a high probability that
we would look at it. But it's not a focus of ours at this point.

cuts. Are there other additional expense opportunities that you could shift to? Or is it really at this point more an
efficiency story as revenue comes back that that would be the primary driver of lower efficiency ratio now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. Just a couple of comments on the expenses. During the first quarter, we mentioned the seasonality. In
total, there's about $10 million of seasonality in the cost base that happens in the first quarter. The stock
compensation that we talked about was $5.6 million. Payroll taxes are $3.6 million. And when you restart the year,
utilities were up $1.2 million. So really there's kind of $10 million that isn't recurring.
So kind of where we go from here, we have [indiscernible] (00:32:39) cost save, which is baked into our guidance
for the third year in a row. And as you noticed, we're still guiding expenses being down for the full year slightly
from 2020 level of $720 million. And as you look ahead to the next quarter, I mean the expenses will come down
in the several million dollar area from first quarter to second quarter from those seasonally elevated levels.
And then, as far as how we kind of execute on the cost savings, I mean this is year three of it. So there's always
been a focus in the company on disciplined management of costs. The things that we've had kind of in our tool
belt continue to be in the tool belt as far as continued optimization of the retail bank, closely monitoring customer
preferences as they evolve. Renegotiating contracts is constant. We've dusted off our top 100 vendors going back
through all of those, including the large ones.
We're starting to have some success as far as optimizing our space throughout the footprint, not just branches,
but also some of our kind of operating facilities. And then kind of RPA is a topic. It's robotic process automation.
We have a bunch of initiatives that we're looking at. And that will be a big focus for us in 2021 and 2022. That's
kind of a newer item. So that's kind of additive to the things we've been focusing on as part of the kind of cost
savings initiatives over the last couple of years.

Jared Shaw Q

Okay, great. Thanks. That's good color. Maybe shifting over to the allowance. With the improving economic
backdrop, how quickly can we see that allowance ratio start to migrate back maybe towards the day one level,
either through a combination of the provision or growth? Is that something we should expect to see maybe lower
dependence on qualitative overlays as you go through the next few quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Hey, Jared. When you look at day one CECL at right around, round figures, $300 million and reserve level in the
high-1.20s versus today at 1.57% in terms of the position of it and about $360 million, we do expect that there's
opportunity there as we move through the cycle. And we see upgrades and reductions in criticized assets that
were impacted by the pandemic.
We did move the forecast in Q4 to a consensus forecast. So we did see a little bit of benefit there. We do expect
to see a little bit of benefit going forward from model-related benefits, as well as I mentioned upgrades from the
criticized portfolio. We were down $51 million in criticized assets this quarter, and we do expect that to continue

as we move forward. The model-related benefits we expect of that delta are about 25% or so and from a credit
standpoint about 75%.
So we do see some benefit coming as we are seeing improved performance in a number of those credits. A final
comment around it from a model framework standpoint, the qualitative piece of it varies from low 20s to about
30%. Right now, we're sitting near the high end of that. So, I would not expect that qualitative to go up any from
where it's at or very slightly. So, there is some benefit in that piece of it as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then just finally for me, you commented on the C&I pipelines being so strong. Geographically, is that
really just focused more on the Carolinas or are you seeing any type of significant trends in your legacy markets?
And when you're talking about that, is that primarily new customers and new customers of the bank? Or do you
think that you get back to that normal utilization level maybe in third quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I would say a couple of things. First of all, it does not necessarily contemplate getting back to normal utilization
rates in the second half of the year. I mean, I think there's still a lot of liquidity out there. There's a lot of cash
sitting on the sidelines for our corporate clients. It's going to take a while to deploy that capital. So, that's one
aspect of it.
Having said that, in our legacy markets as we sit today, we've gotten better production out of the Southeast much
better. The Midwest and the Northeast has been a little slower based on the pipelines that we've had. What we've
actually funded in production in the first quarter. In the second half of the year, there are a number of
opportunities that are coming that are larger in the upper middle market to call it large corporate space that are
kind of M&A related.
So, we've got a number of opportunities within our legacy markets that should drive some growth for us both in
capital markets piece and with the size of the commercial portfolio. So, that's Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Baltimore
markets. And then in the Carolinas, there's still quite a bit of activity across the board. So, we're pretty optimistic
about that.
The pipelines have grown considerably. So if you recall, last quarter, we said things were a little light from –
because we had a big quarter closings in the fourth quarter. But that has rebuilt and actually exceeds where it
was at the high last year. So, we're more optimistic about achieving the guidance that we put out there and
growing in the second half of the year. I hope that helps that – and it's really a combination of both existing
customers and new opportunities that we're seeing.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
We have. We've seen a lot of activity across the board, but it's really increasing in the Carolinas with some of the
bankers that we've brought on over the last four to six months, new leadership in one area there in Charlotte,
who's really generating some nice new name opportunities, high quality credit and some good opportunities that
we've already worked through and in the pipeline. So, we're excited about that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
When I think about the quarter, Jared, I mean, really I think it was a solid quarter even though we didn't show the
loan growth for this quarter. I think there's prospects for loan growth fairly substantial down the road. There's a lot
of activity going on. I feel better about our balance sheet than I ever have because of our CET1 capital ratio at
10%, the amount of liquidity that we have, we've got many options to deploy that liquidity that will enhance
earnings. We're now able to buy shares back, which we couldn't do historically.
So, as I look at the quarter without substantial reserve release, we did pretty well this quarter, and it's a good
foundation to build on as we move throughout the year.

Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Good morning, Michael.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Wanted to start maybe just with the revenue guidance. Obviously the second round of PPP have a little more
color on now, but I noticed the revenue guide wasn't adjusted upwards. So, are other things offsetting it or is that
just putting too fine of a point on the guidance overall?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
So, actually we did revise the guidance, Michael, from where it was in January given round two of PPP. So we
had moved – the revenue originally – I'm trying to remember, it was down slightly with the guide in January, we
moved it up to stable from full year 2020 given the round two contribution. And it's come in pretty strong. I mean,
as I mentioned we said $0.9 billion we're up $1 billion as we sit here today, so we did move the guidance up to
reflect that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thanks. And I guess a follow-up question just on the margin kind of outlook. I know there's a lot of moving
pieces but if we look at maybe NII dollars, should we kind of think about it having bottomed here just on a core
basis ex-PPP and purchase accounting accretion with the potential to continue to kind of steadily climb as liquidity
is deployed and loan growth returns?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. The guidance as you can see on the slide there is for net interest income to be flat from the fourth quarter.
Coming into the first quarter, you did have the impact on the PPP contribution was reduced from where it was in
the fourth quarter, so that kind of ran against the overall decline $7.7 million. So, we expect that to be at a
comparable level in the second quarter to where it was in the first, so you won't have kind of a drag on the PPP.
The cash side of it, it doesn't affect dollars, it doesn't affect the margin. So kind of given where we ended the
quarter, there's an additional drag. And it's good to – I don't know if you noticed, slide 14 is a new slide we've put
in there of kind of a deep composition of net interest income and margin there as we see it. I think the PPP and
PCD contribution increasing on the prior loans, we would expect to be kind of comparable levels in that second
quarter. Like I mentioned, the cash contribution getting a little bit worse from a margin perspective but not really
from a dollar perspective. So, the dollar is kind of being flat just based on those.
And then you have other things. I mean in the first quarter we had one less day. That affects us lag working down
3 basis points. That was $3 million. One less day is $3 million. So first quarter had quite a few things affecting it
that kind of become a help as you move forward from here. So, I would expect that the dollars flat to up as we
move forward as you get into the second half of the year. I think one of the things that's really important is that the
PPP contribution – I mean I really look at that as a bridge to the loan activity and kind of increasing.
So, the contribution has been coming in kind of each quarter. With $31 million in the fourth quarter, $23 million
this quarter, we look for a similar number in the second quarter, down a little bit in the third quarter. But it really

serves as a nice bridge for this commercial loan activity to the traditional commercial loan activity picking up in the
second half of the year. So kind of a long answer there, Michael. But, yeah, I think I would agree with your
statement but I just wanted to kind of talk through the moving parts there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And maybe just one last one just on the share buyback, the $75 million remaining. It's good to see activity
again on it this quarter. Can you just talk about kind of appetite going forward given where the stock price is today
and any other thoughts there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I mean, we'll be opportunistic. It's – we look at capital allocation every day and decide what should we do
with our capital. And it's been said now that you have a CET 1 at 10%, you have some opportunities to kind of
optimize that capital base depending on what happens in the balance sheet.
So, if the loan growth kind of ramps up in the second half of the year, we will be less active. If it doesn't come
through quite as strong, we'll continue to be more active there with our repurchasing. The $75 million is left. We
just kind of have to see how the balance sheet movements kind of transpire from here. But we're definitely – we
still think the stock valuation is very attractive. So, we've been very active. We've bought a good amount, the $36
million in the first quarter. And we'll continue to do the right thing as far as shareholder interest, and we're all
aligned on those. So, we'll continue to manage it appropriately.

fill in from an asset size perspective, geographic perspective? Just any additional thoughts would be great. Thank
you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, I think that obviously in-market transactions would be the most appealing. As I've said though, we've always
been fairly discipline. Our incentive compensation plans are designed for us to grow tangible book value. So,
we're not looking to do a large dilutive transaction, I can tell you that. I think that we're open to it. We'll look at it.
But, again, I don't want to get specific because that's not the principal focus.
We think we have a great model, business model that we're executing on. I mentioned in my quote in the release
that we've done in the release that we've done more than 30,000 applications digitally, so we just launched our
whole digital platform in January. Unfortunately, it was right before – or fortunately, I should say, it was right
before the pandemic so we were able to accommodate customers. But we really didn't have a great opportunity to
promote it like we would have liked. We had to shift gears and focus more on PPP origination, which we did
digitally. And that's all coming online this year, so we'll have a great opportunity to grow organically through that
platform as well. And that's only starting.
So, as we integrate our ability to take applications in the consumer segment, we're enhancing that, we're going to
be able to take loan applications in mortgage and consumer loans, home equity on that platform, and then later in
the year small business loans. So that will significantly change our ability to efficiently go after market share, and
the focus will shift a little bit strategically from a marketing perspective. But I – we've got all of that going on. So, I
don't rule out M&A because I think that it's an important part of our DNA, but again I have quite a few things going
on that are pretty positive and it certainly isn't something that we feel desperate to do.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Hey, Elan. How you doing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Elan Zanger Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
So just looking at the core loan yields, ex-PPP, there was still some compression. Could you maybe talk a little bit
about kind of the outlook there, where are you seeing spread compression, and what's the new money loan yield
that's coming on balance sheet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. In terms of spreads, they had moved up when you go back during the soft period. I can tell you they have
moved down again. They're ranging, depending upon the credit quality, from 1.25% for extremely solid credit to
2.25%, 2.50%, depending upon the transaction, the tenor and the quality of that asset. The real estate
opportunities that we're seeing are generally in the 200 to 250 bps range. Some very strong transactions with
extreme amounts of equity, 50% type of equity, maybe slightly under that. But that gives you a pretty good range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. And I would just add as far as the new loans made during the quarter, if you put the PPP on the side, we
were at 3.25%, 3.24% rate for the new loans kind of from a coupon standpoint. It was 3.21% in the fourth quarter.
So kind of ex PPP – PPP with a 1% coupon brings that number down to 2.40%. So that's kind of running through
the average balance sheet that you'd see there. But the 3.24% versus the 3.21% is kind of an apples-to-apples
number. So some stability there, which is good.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Elan Zanger Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And then back on the securities reinvestment rates. I understand it's more just cash flow coming off, but
that's going back in. Where is that today relative to the 178 basis points that you showed in the first quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, the reinvestment rates, as we looked at what happened during the quarter, it moved significantly. I mean, in
January, 52 basis points is what was available. By March, we had 106 basis points that we were reinvesting at.
So that's kind of a good proxy to use for where we're putting money to work. But again the stuff that's rolling off is
rolling off kind of in the 185 basis points. So there's still 79 basis points difference there.
There's still some of that continue to roll through and have that gap narrow. But that gives you the kind of the
figure as far as where we're reinvesting today. We're not going long. So we're not going to make bets here and
lock stuff up for many years. I mean we've kept the duration on the shorter side so that we will real benefit when
rates move again someday. And we definitely – during the quarter, we kind of backend loaded the reinvestment.
We were definitely less active – much less active in January, 52 basis points, and more active in March. Like I
said earlier, we'll be opportunistic. When we see securities and yields that we like, we'll reinvest.

Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, Stephens Inc.
I just wanted to ask a couple questions on the loan portfolio and kind of going off of the previous question.
Looking at what percentage of loans are in floating rates, so where can we expect kind of a backstop to some of
the loan compression?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
That number has moved up. I want to say we're probably around 15% or so of the portfolio, it sounds for us. I
mean there's been – as we've been going through this recent cycle, there's been an active process to put those in
place so it benefits us next time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)

ability to get floors.

Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
We're getting floors and fewer transactions today. Again, I go back six to nine months when we were very
successful in getting floors into the transactions. We made good progress during that timeframe. It is getting much
more competitive, getting back to the interest rate spread commentary as well. And it's more difficult today than it
has been, and it is reducing pretty significantly at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
That's going to vary based upon the risk profile of the borrower. So if it's a riskier situation, the borrower is going
to agree to a floor. If it's a higher quality credit, the borrower is not going to agree to a floor and you're not going to
be able to impose a floor on them. So we tend to compete – just like everybody says, we tend to go after higher
quality credit opportunities. So really that's a function of the competitive environment. And we try our best, but...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. That's really where it's at today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, Stephens Inc.
I understand. Thank you. And then another data point around that, what percent of the loan portfolio has a floating
rate contract. So I understand 15's at the floor already, but I guess what percentage of the floating rate for the
total?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, total variable and adjustable combined is 56% of the total loan portfolio. And just to give the data points, you
typically give one month LIBOR with 35%, which is $9 billion. And then there's another 9.6%, tied to prime, of $2.4
billion. And that's embedded in that overall 56% figure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Samuel Varga Q
Analyst, Stephens Inc.
Awesome. Thank you very much. And then just one more question tied to this. If we were to see a 25 bps rate
hike sometime this year, what percent of those at the floor would start getting above the floor?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
A very, very small percentage of that, if any. It would be very low. Most of the floors are in the 50 basis points.
We've gotten many in at 100 basis points, very, very few at 25 basis points.

Hey, just wondered if you can comment on the – I appreciate the color on the mortgage and the pipeline. And just
I know, Vince, you talked last quarter about kind of the debt capital market piece and kind of getting into that in
the second half. But just kind of as you look high level, I guess where the fee income is at today at this level it
gets feels pretty sustainable if you have that pick up in the second half and service charges rebound I guess is –
are we thinking about fee income in that way looking at it the right way with that type of sustainability and growth
from here as mortgage remains strong and the other fees kick in and service charges pick up a bit?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I think your characterization is stable. It is a very good characterization. We have – the value of it being as
diversified as it is right helps because not everything's at a record every quarter. But as we look forward from
here, particularly to the second quarter, we would expect mortgage to be similarly strong number. Capital markets
have been very strong, even though it's down from a lights-out record last year, $7 million to $8 million is a very,
very strong quarter there.
So, as we look at what's baked into our guidance, Brian, we're around that $80 million-ish figure per quarter. So
the stability comment is a good way to look at it with some upside with some of the newer initiatives that really are
just starting. So, I think there's some upside that's not baked into the guidance yet because kind of the newness
of it.

Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Right. Okay. Perfect. Okay. And then maybe just one or two others, just on the forgiveness and the remaining
fees that are going to be collected. Given that a lot of that round 2 is just in there, how much do you expect to –

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
big picture to see realized of the $59 million in 2021 versus maybe some bleeding over into 2022? Is that more of
it coming in 2021? Is that your expectation with just a little, I guess, piece that may overhang into 2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I mean, the $59 million that's there, I mean $40 million of it is related to round 2, that portal hasn't been
opened yet, right, so that needs to happen before you have the kind of the machine is cranking there. So there – I
would say, for the next couple of quarters will be fine.
As I mentioned earlier, looking for a similar level in the second quarter, third quarter kind of come down a few
million from there. I mean, there are some tail that would go into 2022, but there's not a ton left that goes through
there. I am trying to think of – and what do we have – what's our – to look ahead, just for 2022, it's far pretty small,
right?

Vincent J. Calabrese A

Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah, okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I don't have the full year in front of me I had the quarterly. But...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay, perfect. And just your comments about the pipeline. I just need to make sure I understood that the
Southeast obviously is doing well. I guess your comments on just – remind me just on the pipelines in the
Northeast and in the Midwest, just how they're looking today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. The second half of the year is much better for our legacy markets. Cleveland, Pittsburgh, even Baltimore.
Baltimore had a great year last year, finished really strong and then it was a little slower in the first quarter. That's
really the Baltimore-D.C. area. They cover both. I think the pipelines for those areas particularly in upper middle

market and large corporate is very solid for the second half of the year. So, we're starting to see some sizable
opportunities coming in. It would generate both capital markets fees and fundings for us.
In the Southeast, their pipelines have been pretty strong and their production has been decent. It's on par with the
first quarter of last year and continues to build. So, Charlotte in particular is performing pretty well and there's
quite a bit coming in. And then even in some of the other business units that we have, Builder Finance which is
based in Charlotte under this CRE group, small portfolio. But we're expecting them to do a little more this year.
We're seeing a lot of activity.

Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
That's very active right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I mean, there is quite a bit going on. If you look at – what I was trying to say and I probably didn't do a great job
was funded production for us in the first quarter was more – there were more solid contributions from the
Southeast than our legacy market. When you look at the pipeline overall end to end for the rest of the year, the
next three quarters, it's a sizable – there's been a sizable increase in the pipeline. So, that tells me that there's a
lot more going on out there than we had initially thought. That's what I was trying to communicate.
