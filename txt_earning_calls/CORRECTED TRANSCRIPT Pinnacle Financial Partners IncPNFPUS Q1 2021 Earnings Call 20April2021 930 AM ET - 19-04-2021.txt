President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thank you, operator, and thank you for joining us this morning. Q1 was an outstanding quarter in my view. Most
of you who've been following us know that during the pandemic, we transitioned quickly to defense, beginning last
January. We believe that not only to shore up asset quality, but we launched a number of initiatives that would
continue to drive PPNR through 2020 and put us in a position to accelerate as the impact of the pandemic wanes.
And so, in Q1, we were able to get off to a really fast start and recognized some of that PPNR growth.
We begin every quarterly call with this dashboard, reflecting our key performance metrics on a GAAP basis. But
as we most always do, because there are so many adjustments required in order to focus on the variables that
we're truly managing here at Pinnacle, I'll move quickly to the chart reflecting the adjusted non-GAAP measures.
Part of our first quarter 2020 earnings call last April, I told you that my expectation was in the final analysis, 2020
wouldn't be about 2020's earnings, but more about how well we position our firm to return to our previous

earnings trajectory following the pandemic. And as you can see here on the top row, the trajectories are all
slopping up into the right with total revenues, fully diluted EPS, and adjusted PPNR, all up meaningfully on a
linked-quarter annualized basis. 2021 revenues were up roughly 14.7% annualized during the first quarter.
Adjusted EPS was up 7.6% annualized during the first quarter. And adjusted PPNR during the first quarter is up
8.4% annualized.
Along the second row, you can see that loans are up 11.8% annualized during the first quarter, inclusive of PPP.
Harold will review in greater detail shortly and talk about expectations going forward. But generally, excluding
PPP, we continue to believe we'll produce loan growth primarily based on our ability to take market share due to
our prolific hiring. We've hired 200 revenue producers in 2019-2020 in the first quarter of 2021 and that's more
than 20% of our total revenue producers. That represents enormous market share movement potential, which I
expect differentiates our growth opportunity for many, if not most of our peers.
Core deposits continued to accelerate at a rapid pace during the first quarter. And in spite of the COVID
challenges, we continue to have a track record for consistently growing tangible book value per share with 14.1%
growth in tangible book value per share year-over-year.
Across the bottom row, you can see that asset quality held up really well in the first quarter, with NPAs of just 36
basis points, that's the lowest level in the last decade. Classified assets also down this quarter to the lowest level
in the last decade. And annualized net charge-offs of just 20 basis points in the quarter.
I'm going to turn it over to Harold and Tim to review the results in much greater detail. As we go through the
details, I find there's a lot to be encouraged about as it relates to revenue growth. First of all, regarding our net
interest margin fundamentals, particularly the trajectory of our cost of deposits. And secondly, fee income.
Mortgage originations and sales continue to run at a record pace. BHG continued to accelerate during this
pandemic and again in the first quarter continues to outperform expectations.
We talked about our transition to defense earlier in 2020, allocating a meaningful part of our human capital to
reviewing our loan book, borrower-by-borrower. Tim's going to update you on the work that he and his team
accomplished here in Q1, as well as give you insights of what we're seeing and learning from our clients,
particularly in these stressed segments. At least for me, our asset quality performance continues to inspire
optimism.
So Harold, let me turn it over to you.

Harold R. Carpenter
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thanks, Terry. Good morning, everybody. Many of my slides, I have shown for quite some time. So, I'm going to
hit the high points. We are pleased with our first quarter loan growth. Excluding PPP, average loans were up 7.2%
annualized between the first quarter and fourth quarter. Excluding PPP, end-of-period loans at March 31
compared to December 31 were up 4.6% annualized. So call it a mid-single-digit growth quarter. As to loan yields,
in spite of the steepening yield curve, and as we mentioned last time, loan yields will be a fight in 2021. We will
lean into our relationships even harder to maintain our yields. There's a lot of equity out there. It sure feels like it's
a borrowers' market right now.
Our [indiscernible] (00:07:23) credits only saw a slight decrease in yields, while LIBOR was down 4 basis points
and fixed rates down 7 basis points. Overall loan rates were down 9 basis points, with PPP loans being down

13%, and the biggest contributor to overall loan yield decline and likely to be the most difficult to model over the
next few quarters, but more on that in a second.
So where to from here? Our market leaders continue to believe that our end-of-period loan growth forecast,
excluding PPP in the high-single digits for 2021 is a reasonable number for our firm. We built that estimate from
the ground up based on continual dialogue with our frontline lenders. As always, we will lean on our new hires to
take it – to give us an advantage on loan growth, coupled with our markets which we believe to be the best
banking markets with the best bankers in the Southeast, we're optimistic about our loan growth goals for 2021.
As to yields, we still have about 60% of our floating variable rate loan book on in-the-money floor, so that will help
shield some of the pain, should loan rates continue to be under pressure. Hopefully, we can get some traction
from a steepening yield curve over time.
Speaking of PPP and the tons of work that's been accomplished here, we've funded around $3.4 billion between
the two 2020 programs and the 2021 program. We're just over $900 million in 2021 fundings, about where we
thought we'd end up. New application volume is slowing. So, we don't anticipate a great deal more. Here's what
we're hearing and I'm definitely not on the frontline, but it seems to [ph] rain through (00:09:00). The 2021
program hit the mark and was primarily used to help smaller businesses at least from our perspective. The
process has improved since last year and this has made life somewhat easier for us and our clients. The FDA
continues to move around, change the rules, but all in all, it's in a better spot. No one is casting stones, as we
can't imagine what the SBA had to deal with over the last year to get these programs up and running. As to
forgiveness, smaller clients are getting done, say loans less than $150,000, while loans say greater than $2
million appear to be on the SBA back-burn and have been for quite some time.
During the quarter, a slow for some technical issues that the SBA was dealing with and then we ran into tax
season with a lot of clients working with their CPA. Our thoughts are that eventually substantially all of our clients
who have not repaid their loans will seek forgiveness. Not sure whether another round of PPP will come around,
but if it does, we will dive in and believe the appetite will be there, but it will be limited.
As for our PPP results for the second quarter, we're modeling a decrease in total revenues, somewhat consistent
to the decrease between the fourth and first quarter. It all depends on the pace of forgiveness. Eventually, the
SBA will get at the greater than $2 million loan, so that is coming to us. We just don't know when. We have about
$360 million in loans awaiting forgiveness with the SBA currently and approximately $200 million where we are
working with clients to gather necessary data to submit to the SBA for approval.
Now onto deposits, we had another big deposit quarter. Core deposits were up almost $1.5 billion in the first
quarter. We've experienced significant growth in noninterest-bearing deposits ending up at $8.1 billion at quarter-
end, up 63% since last year. Obviously, we believe a significant part of that is government stimulus. Our average
loans to average deposit ratio was down only 11 basis points to 82.7%. So, we consider that a small victory. Our
average deposit rates were 26 basis points, while EOP deposit rates were at 22 basis points. So, we continue to
see downward momentum for 2021 and look to be around 15 basis points by the fourth quarter of 2021, assuming
our short-term rate forecast remained consistent for the remainder of this year.
Liquidity builds for nearly all banks is gaining more attention. The steepening of the yield curve has gotten our
attention, but we remain neutral on any sort of big bond deployment strategy at present. Our securities to assets
ratio has been 13% to 14% for a long time. Our estimates are that our peers were running slightly more than that
in the 15% to 20% range. We may deploy a modest amount of liquidity into bonds over the next few quarters, but
it will be months.

We also allocated about $450 million late in the first quarter into a repo instrument which is secured by a
counterparty's investment securities portfolio. This is a floating rate instrument that yields around 40 basis points
currently. So, it'll be more impactful in the second quarter. We're looking at a somewhat similar product currently,
but it won't be as large.
I mentioned all of this to let you know we are actively looking at prudent investments, where we can minimize or
eliminate credit risk, while creating some earnings momentum. As the top chart indicates, we will again have an
opportunity to reduce our wholesale funding book in the second quarter, which we fully anticipate. This almost $1
billion reduction is in our broker deposit books, which we acquired as part of our intentional liquidity build last year
at the onset of the pandemic. This reduction should help reduce deposit costs and help our NIM slightly on the go-
forward.
Additionally, we have about $900 million in Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, but the prepayment penalty
remains such that the payback period on those is still four to five years. So, we will hold tight for now but monitor
those borrowings continue. We believe our NIM after PPP and liquidity was approximately 3.29% in the same
quarter, which compares to a similar calculation last quarter of 3.27%. Thus, our adjusted NIM is now up four
quarters in a row. Also, our GAAP NIM is now up three quarters in a row. We anticipate flat to up slightly for the
rest of the year. PPP forgiveness will have a lot to do with that.
Now to fee income, I'll be brief. Fees were $92.7 million for the quarter. For the quarter, fee revenues were more
than 44% over the first quarter number of last year. Wealth management had a great quarter in comparison to last
year. We continue to be very active on the hiring front across our franchise, particularly as we continue to build
wealth management in the Carolinas and Atlanta.
Mortgage beat our expectations by a mile, posting revenues of $13.7 million for the quarter, up $1.3 million from
last quarter. Second quarter is looking strong as well. As we sit here today, we are much more optimistic about
mortgage origination in 2021 than we were three months ago, as the right market does not appear to be moving
away from us as quickly as we anticipated it might. Our markets remain strong and we have hired several key
originators in several of our markets over the last few quarters.
I'll talk more about BHG in a minute. But BHG continues to issue great report cards quarter-after-quarter.
As to expenses, specifically incentives, I think everyone is familiar with the impact of incentive costs to our
expense base and if our earnings were hitting our targets, then incentive costs go up; if not, they go down. 2020
was very much a downer at least in terms of incentives for our associates. But we fully anticipate based on the
current operating environment that 2021 will come back strong. And hopefully, our associates will recoup some of
that lost incentive from 2020. We have provided an opportunity this year to our associates to earn an outsized
incentive. That said, there's no free lunch; increased incentives only occur if our earnings growth supports the
incentive.
Last year provision expense and CECL required an outsized reserve build, which directly impacted our incentive
plans, probably more so than most. It only stands to reason that if we're able to recoup some of that prior year
reserve build this year, then some of that should find its way to our associates. This year, our annual cash
incentive is tied to the usual [ph] salaries (00:15:19) and earnings growth numbers. We also maintain the PPNR
component which we added during the middle of 2020.

Additionally, our board has also changed the way equity compensation works for the leadership of the firm.
Rather than achieving absolute goals for our performance-based equity awards, our [indiscernible] (00:15:37) will
be based on how we rank within a peer group, specifically targeting ROTCE and tangible book value growth over
a three-year period along with a modifier based on total shareholder return. That change we believe is more
shareholder-friendly over the long term.
I probably have spent too much time on incentives. But those of you that have been around for a while, you know
our unique incentive culture, incentive structure is cultural. And it is definitely part of what drives the heartbeat of
our firm. For both the annual cash and equity incentive plans, the first quarter would indicate we're trending in the
right direction.
As to expense run rate, we're anticipating personnel expense with all of our new hires coming on board, and
inclusive of our increased incentives, personnel expense should increase between 2% to 3% each quarter for the
remainder of the year. Conversely, all of our other non-personnel costs which amounted to slightly more than
$242 million last year should see that high-single-digit percentage decrease; that's right, a decrease in 2021.
As I stated before, the leadership of our firm is determined to not let a trend develop with a less than target paid
out to our associates. That's a trend we will work hard to avoid in 2021. But to accomplish that, we all are looking
forward to meeting and exceeding our financial objectives this year.
Quickly some comments on capital. I'll be brief. We raised our dividend to $0.18 a share last quarter. With the
share price where it is, we've not acquired any shares and we don't anticipate buying any in the near term. We've
been working to redeem a couple of sub debt issuances this year. And as I mentioned previously, we've
intensified our focus on tangible book value growth by adding a component for it in our leadership's equity
compensation plans.
As to our outlook [ph] and I won't go through (00:17:28) this slide in depth, as we have covered most of this
previously, so this is really a summary for the model builders out there of what we think. Obviously, we realize that
we appear more optimistic than most. That said, we have great confidence in our people, our markets, and our
clients, and renewed optimism about where the Pinnacle is headed.
Now BHG. These slides that we've shown for several quarters, the blue bars on the chart are originations and we
have ramped up with more loans being funded, with records being set nearly every quarter for the past three
quarters. First quarter was a record for both originations and placements. The green bar represents loans from
which gain-on-sale has been recorded, as these loans are sold to downstream banks. This is the traditional BHG
model with gain-on-sale revenues being generated.
Coupons have fluctuated somewhat over the last three years ending at 13.6% for the first quarter. As to bank buy
rate, they fell to 4% in the first quarter. So net spreads remain in the mid-9s, which over time is up from previous
years. The bottom right chart now over 1,200 banks in BHG network and almost 700 individual banks acquired
BHG loans last year. This has to be one of the strongest funding platforms for a gain-on-sale model in the
country. This slide is probably the best slide that demonstrates the growth potential of BHG's model.
[indiscernible] (00:18:54) have improved significantly over the last two years and it is resulting in better hit rates
and more loans meeting our credit standards.
As to credit, we've updated the BHG's charge-offs and reserve build chart. These are for loans that BHG has sold
to their network of community banks. The green bar shows that currently they have just under $3.9 billion in credit

with banks who have acquired BHG loan. The orange line details the annual loss rate, while the blue line on the
chart details the recourse accrual as a percentage of outstanding loans with these other banks.
Trailing 12 first quarter 2021 losses landed at 4.5%, basically consistent with the last few years, and during the
year where who knew how COVID would impact loss rates. The risk – the recourse obligation reserve is used to
reserve for future losses for the loans sold to other banks. With COVID, they increased the reserves by
approximately [ph] $15 million (00:19:47) in the first quarter. But as a percentage of loans, it was down slightly.
The top left chart, we've shown on several occasions. The quality of BHG's borrowers has improved steadily in
the past, and over the last few years, BHG continues to refine their scorecards and increased the quality of its
borrowing base. Again the right chart, and as I've said before, may be the most powerful chart I have to offer
related to BHG's steadily improving credit quality.
Looking at losses by vintage, losses continue to level out in earlier months since origination, thus pointing toward
a lower loss percentage over the life of the underlying loans. Pandemic-related events may cause these losses to
move upward, but the quality of the borrowing base in our opinion is very impressive and is much better than just
from a few years ago.
Lastly, we said in last quarter and we'll say it again, 2020 was a big year for BHG and we anticipate big things in
2021. Last year, BHG executed on their first $160 million securitization. This allowed BHG to continue to diversify
its revenues and its funding sources. We're expecting another similar securitization at BHG in the near future here
in the second quarter of 2021. BHG's earnings continue to ramp up. BHG had a great operating quarter in the first
quarter, very much exceeded everyone's expectations, even theirs. We've upped our expectations for 2021
quarterly, now expecting 2021 to produce outsized growth in relation to 2020 of 20% to 25% or more before we
had anticipated high-single-digit growth.
So wrapping up, loan growth and loan pricing for Pinnacle in 2021 will take work, but we are optimistic. Deposit
growth has been remarkable. Deposit pricing is headed down. NIM should be flat to up. BHG had another great
quarter and we continue to believe in them. Personnel costs will go up, but correlated to increased earnings,
credit for both Pinnacle and BHG, we believe, is in very much great shape.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Tim to talk more about growth.

Timothy H. Huestis
Chief Credit Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thank you, Harold. Good morning, everyone. Using the traditional credit metrics of net charge-offs, NPAs,
classified assets and past due accruing loans, Pinnacle's loan portfolio continues to perform very well. In the first
quarter, as in prior quarters during COVID, our bankers and credit teams continued their thorough client credit
reviews. Particular emphasis was placed on non-pass credit, our hotel portfolio, and credits in our COVID-specific
low-pass risk grade.
Our first quarter credit metrics are very encouraging. Our classified assets decreased again this quarter dropping
by $17 million and our classified asset ratio declined to a very modest 7.3%. NPAs also decreased this quarter
down to just 36 basis points. And finally, criticized loans decreased during the quarter by $85 million. Similar to
prior quarters in 2020, we conducted a four-question survey during March of 405 C&I clients with loan balances
totaling $931 million. The survey was specifically targeted to our low-pass risk grade clients in a wide variety of
segments such as entertainment, restaurants, consumer services and healthcare. The questions inquired about
revenue projections for the current quarter compared to the same period last year and months of liquidity. The

survey results report a more optimism than our fourth quarter 2020 survey responses that we previously shared
with you. Of particular note, 87% versus 60% in December said first quarter 2021 revenue should be between
75% and 100% of first quarter 2020. 62% versus 53% in December have seven months of liquidity or greater.
This slide is to provide an update on Pinnacle's loans that were modified under Section 4013 of the CARES Act.
Our Section 4013 modifications were negotiated with borrowers from the perspective of providing the client a
longer-term solution to help them bridge to the other side of COVID. Our approach was to improve Pinnacle's
position and simultaneously help the client. With each modification, we collected very current borrower
information as we sought to accurately re-risk grade the loan and to contemplate the terms of our modification.
A key distinction between deferrals offered first and second quarter of 2020 and these modifications executed in
third and fourth quarter is the vast majority of our clients with Section 4013 modifications, or at a minimum, paying
interest monthly. With each Section 4013 modification for our hotel loans was negotiated to fit the borrowers'
specific circumstance. Our modifications generally consisted of changing the loan repayment terms to interest-
only for three to 12 months in consideration for borrower concessions such as pay the accrued interest that
accumulated during the earlier deferral period, establish an interest reserve on deposit with Pinnacle, and shorten
the loan maturity.
As illustrated in our supplemental deck, Pinnacle's hotel book has held up. Of particular note, our hotel portfolio
occupancy has been stronger than the national average as reported by STR for eight of the last nine months. As
an example, our average occupancy for the month of February was 50% versus the national average at that time
of 45%.
On a very positive note, STR reported for the week ended April 10, national hotel occupancy was 59.7%. This is
the highest level in the past 12 months. Given that 74% of our hotel loans are in the economy, limited service or
extended stay segments, we believe this improving occupancy trend bodes well for our portfolio.
Many of our hotel clients in these particular segments can cover operating expenses and interest when
occupancy is in the mid-40% range. As a testament to our conservative hotel underwriting prior to COVID, we
only have four loans totaling $6.6 million that are rated classified.
With the American Rescue Plan, the deadline for banks to complete Section 4013 modifications was extended
from December 31, 2020 to January 1, 2022. As this table illustrates, we've had very little change in our Section
4013 loan modifications after the original deadline.
This next slide is to provide a brief overview of our different credit delivery channels. While the structure of our
different channels may not appear unique, we believe it is our model of hiring experienced bankers in combination
with the design of Pinnacle's loan underwriting channels that drives our results. Several of our key tenants that
help us play offense during the good times and also execute defense very effectively include for C&I and CRE
loan request greater than $1 million, we have credit teams in market working directly with our financial advisor.
The credit teams have historically joined the banker on prospect or client calls.
For loans greater than $1 million, we do not use remote centralized credit factories or hubs as many of our
regional competitors do. At Pinnacle, our FAs partner and collaborate with credit very early in the loan request.
We believe this practice of quickly involving credit on loan requests is different than our competitors. Average
years of experience for our senior credit officers is 29 years and the average years of experience for our credit
analysts is 21 years. We believe our credit teams' experience level has served us well in converting prospects to
customers and serving our clients.

And our Special Assets team is led by a 40-year industry veteran. His team of special assets advisors average 16
years of work at experience. Pinnacle's financial advisors are encouraged to raise their hand early with any loan
exhibiting early signs of distress. Our culture of involving our special assets experts early has been a key driver in
the positive trend in our classified assets and NPAs. Pinnacle's credit metrics have held up well. Although we
have shifted back to an offensive stance, we will continue our thorough defensive work on clients in the impacted
segments, and in particular, our hospitality book.
And now, Terry, I'll hand it back over to you.

M. Terry Turner
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Okay. Thanks, Tim. On the one hand I think it's too early to spike the football as it relates to COVID, but it seems
apparent to me that as a result of the progress on the vaccines along with all the stimulus has been poured into
the economy, we're setting up for a strong second half of 2021. And as we've said many number of times, it's
been our intent since last January to get a position to seize those opportunities that would inevitably exist in the
Southeast as the economy begins to reignite. As I mentioned in my introductory comments, in my view, first
quarter was an outstanding quarter with NPAs of 36 basis points, classified assets down to 7.3%, past dues down
to just 9 basis points. Asset quality actually appears excellent. And many of the threats we once feared seem to
have subsided.
Adjusted EPS was up 313% over the same quarter last year. Importantly, adjusted PPNR was up 25.2% over the
same quarter last year, and revenues were up roughly 20% over the same quarter last year. And now at a time
when both fintech and asset generators are garnering enormous multiples, we believe that BHG's validated the
power of their differentiated model, as they continue to originate and sell record volumes of loans through their
proprietary auction platform.
As Harold mentioned, we expect that they'll do another securitization in Q2. And as Harold also has already
mentioned, even with the securitization, they're now forecasting income growth of 20% to 25% this year. And so,
we believe all this sets up for a great 2021. Building on that foundation and momentum, as we move through the
remainder of 2021, we're extremely bullish on our organic growth opportunities. Coming out of the pandemic,
Greenwich Associates has estimated based on their market research among business owners that roughly 20%
of the revenues to banks is in motion.
There is a high level of dissatisfaction with large banks' responsiveness during COVID. Contributing factors,
including handling the payment deferrals early on, then PPP and then certainly loan request. Also based on
business owner feedback, Greenwich has developed a Crisis Response Index which ranks banks based on their
response to the crisis by aggregating how clients write them on the most important criteria during the pandemic.
Not surprisingly, in their fourth quarter 2020 data, Pinnacle is one of the highest rated banks in the nation, naming
that we're one of the best positioned banks in the country to capitalize on this money in motion is 20% of
revenues available to the industry based on client dissatisfaction.
Beyond that, we're one of the most attractive banks to work for in the country. We were just listed again in Fortune
magazine as one of the top 100 places to work in the country, one of the limited number of banks on the list and
that reputation is that it has enabled us to hire a record number of revenue producers in 2019, another record in
2020. And as the first quarter predicted, we should track another record number of revenue producers in 2021
which would suggest outsized organic growth.

And perhaps most importantly, we're located in markets with some of the [ph] best-sized (00:33:00) growth
dynamics in the country. Nashville continued to create jobs which will further accelerate its growth most recently
with its announcement of Oracle's expansion international, 8,500 jobs in $1.2 billion capital investment. Also
recent announcements by the partnership with GM and LG on a $2.3 billion investment, build a battery plant here
in Middle Tennessee with 1,200 jobs. Similarly, Raleigh recently announced that North America's largest end-to-
end biopharmaceutical manufacturing facility will be located in Wake County and create more than 725 jobs. And
Google will bring in an engineering hub with its many – probably as many as 1,000 jobs that add in all other
successes in the triangle. And of course, Atlanta continues to be the land of milk and honey. Georgia was recently
named the top state to do business for the seventh consecutive year, and I'm not exaggerating, the Metro Atlanta
Chamber's list of meaningful relocations and expansions for 2020 is a seven-page document. It's unbelievable.
And finally, I've already alluded to the importance we place on being in the largest and fastest growing markets in
the Southeast. In the past, we've published maps of the southeast, ex-Florida, to demonstrate our target markets
and we filled out the majority of those markets with the acquisition of BNC in 2017 and de novo start in Atlanta. At
this point, I can't name a franchise with a more attractive footprint or that's better situated.
Going forward, I think the best illustration of our target markets is simply a list of the largest and fastest growing
MSAs in the Southeast, now including Florida. We're satisfied and believe that we've adequately demonstrated
that our distinctive model is universally effective in the Southeast. And as we've already pointed out, we believe
there's great vulnerability in the large banks who dominate these markets. I would say we're seeing
unprecedented opportunities to enter those markets, in a few cases with potential strategic combinations, but in
many cases on a de novo basis which we like a lot.
Our firm has almost always been a high-growth financial services firm. Going forward, we see extraordinary
vulnerability at the large banks that dominate many of our markets. We expect to attract best bankers in both our
existing and potentially attractive markets around the Southeast. We love the size and growth profile of the
markets that are in our existing footprint. We expect to have opportunities to expand into other attractive
Southeastern markets. So again, I think we are excited about the potential growth, both short and long term.
Operator, I'm going to stop there and we'll be glad to open the floor for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Turner. The floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first
question comes from Jared Shaw from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, everybody. Maybe if we start with BHG, I mean that's great trends that you're seeing there.
And with the securitization, are they doing that just really to keep that avenue open or should we expect as we go
through the year that securitizations will be a bigger part of that? And I guess, how big could the balance sheet at
BHG get or how big would they be comfortable with that getting versus selling them?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think they're pretty confident with growing their balance sheet. They will have a securitization
accomplished here in the second quarter and we would not be surprised to see they will accomplish another one
before the end of this year. So, they've not gone away from that diversification strategy, Jared. So, we fully
anticipate them to grow it. They think they can get their balance sheet up meaningfully here over the next couple
or three years.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then with that revenue coming in and then Terry's comments about the opportunities in these other
markets including Florida, is there an opportunity for you all to be dramatically increasing the hiring pace of
revenue producers in some of these new markets? And can you take this as an opportunity to really expand that
Atlanta model into other markets? And if so, is that included in your expense outlook or would that be additional
as those opportunities come up?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, I'll talk about the expense outlook and what's in it and what's not in it, and let Terry go into the hiring plan for
the rest of this year in other markets. We do include a kind of call it a placeholder for new revenue hires for the
rest of the year. Traditionally, I think we'd call that de minimis, so that every market leader has at least some room
in their plan for new hires. But it's in no way, shape or form kind of the target that we're looking for out of these
market leaders and what we expect from them in these markets. Does that make sense, Jared?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yeah. So, if there's a bigger opportunity then that would not be reflected in the budget at this point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
That's right. If they get outsized hiring going on, we'll fully support that.

M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Hey, Jared. I guess I would add to Harold's comments. I do believe that we are likely to have incremental
opportunities in markets that we're not currently in. We do have – I think we do have great reputation, and as you
know, there's a fair amount of turmoil around the Southeast with some of the bigger companies and we found that
we have people contacting us from various markets that are interested in coming and moving the team and so
forth. And so, we continue to evaluate those opportunities and get those opportunities and so forth. But I do
believe that we're very likely to have incremental hiring opportunities in markets that we're not currently in.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Great. And then just finally for me, I guess, can you give an update on how the new hires that have been
brought on over the last 18 months or so, how are they doing in terms of actual production versus the goal, and
obviously, COVID threw everyone for a loop, but are they getting traction, are they able to start chopping some
wood on that 20% of bank revenue that's in motion right now?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. We think so, Jared. What we do is we track kind of our revenue producers based on how long they've been
with us, and obviously, the ones that have been here the longest are the ones that are producing most of the
continual revenues for us. But we track them based on tenures of one year, three years, five years and then more
than five years. And the newer, I guess, I'll call them hirees are coming up the ranks. We're pleased with that. And
we fully anticipate that they will be the ones that give us the momentum we need here over the next couple of
years. As Terry mentioned, I think it's something like 20% to 25% of our revenue producers have been hired
during the last couple of years. We think that's an incredible opportunity for us here in the near term.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Jared, again, I'll add to Harold's comments. I think your question is on the right track. COVID does impact – and I
would say it this way, it lengthens the sales cycle both in terms of our ability to recruit people as well as their
ability to recruit their clients to the firm. So, it does lengthen in COVID where it's just more difficult to get in front of
clients and those kinds of things. But that said, as Harold mentioned, we are tracking and we are seeing the
progress grow. And we do believe that based on what the pipelines are building that they'll be able to deliver, and
as you say, get traction on this 20% of the share that's in motion.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. I guess just that then when you look at your loan optimism overall though, is it a combination of being
driven by new clients or better utilization or sort of equally both?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, I think it is about we see increased line of credit draw that's helpful. But we also see an extraordinarily high
level of pay-downs in commercial real estate. So, they sort of balance each other. And so when you work your
way down to the net growth, I think the biggest factor in our ability to produce that will be these new hires' ability to
move that market share.

now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, good morning, everyone. How're you doing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Good. How're you doing, Steve?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Doing well. Thank you. And I apologize if I missed the first couple of questions there. But I guess, one of my
questions for you, Terry, just longer-term, as you think about BHG, and obviously, I know there's a lot of
unknowns and if that ever creates a liquidation event. But how do you guys think about capital priorities if and
when that were to occur and maybe specifically around M&A, given you probably do have that advantage
currency you have kind of sought in terms of M&A over time? I think you're at about 2:4 tangible versus your
peers at 2 times tangible today. So kind of just wondering how you think about that capital deployment and
opportunity set there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think as I've sort of alluded to in the prepared remarks there, it is obvious our stock is advantaged. I do
think there's M&A opportunity that seems to be picking up. Again, not such a wild stream of announcements, but it
seems to me there are lots of – there's lot of dialogue going on, and so we continue to evaluate M&A
opportunities really across the front. And so, anyway, I think you know this Steve, and I think going back to last
year, somebody asked about M&A. And my response was what? I mean, I wouldn't spend my currency trading
slightly above tangible book value, but it's [ph] 3.4% (00:44:18). That is a different equation. And so, we look to
optimize both the opportunity and the advantage of the stock.
And so, anyway, I guess I'd just characterize it that way. I don't want to overplay it or overbill it or oversell it. As
you know, there are thousands of circumstances that come together make it work, but certainly we're in a different
position than we would have been even six months ago as it relates to M&A. I think on the – as it relates to BHG,
it is just so hard to – if we get to ask questions a lot about what would you do with this, what would you do with
that? I mean, there's so many circumstances that are unknown. What would the valuation be? What – how much
might be sold? How much – there are just 1000 right ways, 1000 variables that would influence what choice we
make when we get there. But I would say this; it's a really luxurious problem to having in a position with so much
money interested in what they do. So, anyway, right, we just have to cross that bridge when we get there.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Yeah, yeah. Definitely a high class problem, I suppose. It's been a great investment. Does it make you want to
think about other non-bank acquisitions, I guess, moving forward, or is that something you're exploring more than
just the traditional bank deals, whether that be fintech-type investments, I know you've done some of already, or
other line of business type acquisitions?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think I would say that we hire and we continue to look at sort of alternative kinds of investments, like BHG,
I think you're aware, Advocate Capital, which is – it's a smaller scale deal, but it's a meaningful deal. We've got a
small investment in our blazing gun. We've got some – our approach on these things is generally using
[indiscernible] (00:46:20) when you fire bullets, [indiscernible] (00:46:23) involved, as you know. And so, we do
like that, they're found in both fintech and asset generators that same differentiated. And so, you don't expect us
to continue to look in that vein. It's not exactly like looking for a unicorn, but it's also – they are not just
everywhere. So, it takes a little more – there might be a little more serendipity in that, I think, but certainly, we're
interested in those kinds of things.
I think on the lines of business, I'm not saying there aren't any, but I say less of those just to be candid. We've got
a pretty well fully built-out of product capability. And when you look at some of these things that we would have an
Interesting line, take P&C insurance or something like that, I mean when you get down to brass tacks of it, you got
all this roll-up going on, people buying extraordinary multiples and it creates too much goodwill for us. I mean
when you get into some of those sort of wealth management lines are really hard to acquire and feel like you're
going to either make a good deal or you're going to be able to retain the revenues, many of those things are
personality- and so forth. So, I would be less excited about lots of business than I am about bank M&A or other
sort of fintech, asset generators.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just last thing for me, I might need you to stop talking about Atlanta so
much because there's people everywhere here and the traffic bad again. So, you can't highlight it too much, but
I'm wondering kind of where you are on the progress front there in terms of how many lenders you have on the
team now, maybe the base of loans? And then I know you mentioned specifically wealth management for Atlanta
and North Carolina. And is that just building out the teams or is there a specific opportunity around wealth
management in those environments that you're really seeing that's leading you to push into that space in
particular?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think, again, David, I would characterize – honestly, I would characterize our opportunities in some of
these North Carolina markets specifically. Charlotte and Raleigh are really similar to Atlanta. Again, of course,
Atlanta is the biggest and most vibrant, but those other two markets are really handsome markets and we have
such small chair positions that we sort of look at those much like we would the de novo start in Atlanta.
I think the hiring has generally been pretty even. I can't recite the numbers in each of those markets, but we're
hiring revenue producers in each of those markets, both of which you might call traditional financial advisors or
relationship managers, as well as the rest of the revenue-producing categories like mortgage originators, brokers
and trust administrators. I think you asked about the opportunity. I do think that the large banks that we've been
working on to hire relationship managers from have really high vulnerability in some of these wealth management

businesses, trust administrators, portfolio managers, brokers and so forth. And so, that's really the opportunity
that we're trying to seize for the other revenue producers.

Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Brock Vandervliet from UBS. Your line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
On BHG, just to confirm, so that's a 20% to 25% net income growth guide for this year. Is that right, Harold?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yes, or more.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And where's that growth coming from? A couple of quarters ago you had a lot of disclosure about new
verticals. Is that been kind of sidestepped? And this is all the traditional more traditional growth areas or is it new
verticals too?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think there's a list of things that they – because we asked them the same question. I think the gain-on-sale
model is operating at pretty much peak efficiency. They've got a better data. They're able to go out and send out
more opportunities to do business with people, so on and so forth. I think their resolution of substituting loans is
better than they anticipated post COVID, so they've got some break there. I think with the improved credit outlook,
you're likely to see some reduction in reserves for losses. I don't think it'll be like a big kind of cliff thing, but I think
it'll be steady for the rest of the year. So, I think when you put all that into the blender, they're coming out thinking
this year is going to be a great year for them. And so that's how we got to the 20%, 25% or more.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And shifting over to the funding side, I believe relative to our model, part of this was just the reduction in
some of your wholesale deposits. But it did kind of stand out to me as you're showing a decline in the rate of
deposit growth, it seems. Could you speak to that, are you seeing any peaking there?

Well, we hope we're seeing some peaking there, but I can't really give you any kind of comfort that we're going to
see core deposit growth lessen. We're active in several different initiatives to kind of grow lower cost, smaller
account balance deposits. But we will see more runoff in the wholesale book. We've got like a – like we
mentioned, we got $1 billion coming out this quarter. But, hopefully, that will be enough so that we don't grow the
funding book like we did here in the first quarter.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Hey, Steve, good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I want to start on the loan outlook. I appreciate the improved optimism on loan growth. But given the industry is up
to its eyeballs on liquidity, particularly your larger competitors, can you talk about the competitive environment
today for lending and could that impact your ability to get that high-single-digit growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. That's a great question. I think Harold alluded to in his comments the fact that it sort of feels like a
borrowers' market. There's a handful of reasons for that. But clearly one of them is limited loan demand which
drives pricing lower and those kinds of things. So, what your own is a correct theme and right theme, I believe.
We believe that we have taken that into account in our forecast. Nobody knows the future, I guess. But what we
believe is that if you just sort of look at the loan demand in our footprint, if you will, economic loan demand is still
very low. We expect it will pick up in the latter half of the year, but it will be muted by all the liquidity in the system.
And so, where we believe we get the growth is from really incremental hires moved in market share from where
they were to us. And so that's the principal assumption about where the growth comes from. It's less dependent
upon economic loan demand than it is market share movement.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then if we look at the COVID-19 impacted segments, hotel, restaurant, et cetera, how
are you looking at those exposures from a long-term view and do you have any plans to reduce those exposures
over time?

Timothy H. Huestis A
Chief Credit Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Certainly in hospitality, where we have no appetite, we haven't generated a new hotel loan since the first quarter
of last year. I would tell you that our underwriting for CRE retail certainly has changed. We've really shifted that to
single tenant, credit tenant exposures and grocery anchored. So, I think part of the answer is just shifting the
appetite within CRE. Restaurants are certainly more conservative. We have some in franchise concepts that we're
still tracking well, but I would tell you with restaurants it's guardedly optimistic and strict underwriting. So hopefully
that might have helped to answer your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay, thanks. And then my last question, Terry, given the earlier commentary about the improved valuation and
maybe you're looking at M&A opportunities a bit differently, is the flip side of that that you're not looking as active
on the buyback side? I know you have $125 million plan out there, but how are you currently thinking about that
given the valuation of the stock? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think, Steven, I'll answer your question directly on the buyback. But just to be clear, I think I used the
phrase and talking about that I don't want to oversell it, overbill it. I'm not saying we're going to make an
acquisition. I'm just saying we're in a different position and there are lots of discussions going on and
opportunities to consider those kinds of things. So, I don't know, I'm just trying to get that shaped up where
somebody understands, we do have a high valuation does create some opportunity, but I don't want to overplay
the likelihood that we're going to run out here in and make much acquisitions, because I don't think we're going to
make much acquisitions.
So, at any rate, let me, hopefully, they'll better frame that currently. Then, as it relates to the buyback, yes, I think
you're right, I don't think you ought to have an expectation right now that we would ride back in and buy shares
primarily, as you say, is a function of the valuation. We just – we looked at that differently. We'd like to have an
authorization. We'll watch it over time. But I don't think we have an intent to buy shares at this price.

Brett D. Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group
I'm good, thanks. First, Harold, I was curious maybe what's your crystal ball might be telling you on liquidity, I
know you thought that might start to drain at some point and it's obviously extended out for yourselves as well as
the industry. Can you maybe give us some color on how you see that liquidity being deployed over time? And how
much of that might happen and how much of it just kind of drains naturally with people using cash?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, that is a crystal ball, it's kind of question, Brett. We likely will – a modest amount of bonds will likely go into
the market here over the next two to three quarters. We might build our percentage up from a 13.5% up to a
14.5% or something like that. It won't be a big number that we've got in all likelihood, I don't know, $1.5 billion or
so of PPP loans that we anticipate coming to us here over the next four quarters. So, we're – that will provide
additional liquidity to offset redeeming some of these wholesale funds. It's going to be a fight. It'll be a war to try to
drain some of this liquidity. We remain optimistic about loan growth targets. We remain optimistic about reducing
deposit rates. And we particularly got some larger depositors that are more rate-sensitive and they fully
appreciate how the value equation works. And if they can find a better number at another financial institution,
they'll move that money. And right now, we're okay with it. We don't think it damages our relationship with our
client at all. So, there's a lot of things that are in play to try to get some of those liquidity off our balance sheet.

Okay. Appreciate the color there. And then the other thing I was curious about was in the guidance for expenses,
you talked about requiring increased infrastructure support. But you're obviously giving guidance for non-
personnel expenses to be lower this year. Can you talk maybe about the increased infrastructure support, what
that all entails? Are you guys doing anything on investing or infrastructurally that might change the dynamic
outside of the personnel line?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, not really. I don't think we're doing anything as far as bricks-and-mortar. We've got a couple of branches, I
guess, in play here this year, but there's nothing big as far as buildings or technology that would cause you to be
– call it a blip on the radar. Most of our infrastructure build comes around personnel and it'll be, call it, for one
revenue producer we end up hiring two to three other people in support of that revenue producer. So that's the
infrastructure that we refer to in those comments.

Okay. And then if I could sneak in one last one around the change to the equity compensation, just the tangible
book value per share growth being added to that, does that change how you might view M&A in terms of thinking
about payback periods or [ph] tangible book (01:01:36) dilution?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, it certainly is impactful. So, it would be something we would need to consider. Traditionally, our board has
been willing to work with us on significant events and how that might impact longer-term incentive plans.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett D. Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group
Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for all the color.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: And thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Olney from Stephens. Your line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey, great, thanks, good morning. I want to ask about the bank's sensitivity to interest rates. On slide 52, you
gave us some good disclosures and it looks like the bank continues to move to a liability-sensitive position. But
when I read some of the comments on that slide, it sounds like you've got some levers to pull to offset this over
the next year or two. Should we be assuming by the time rates do increase on the short end whether it's next year
or 2023 or whenever that Pinnacle will at least be in a rate neutral position, if not asset-sensitive? Just trying to
appreciate kind of what the strategy is. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, that's a great question, Matt, and you're right. We've got some levers. We've got $1.5 billion in loan floors
that are a gain right now that we could unwind today and that'll free up $1.5 billion in floating rate assets to move
us to more an asset-sensitive position. So, we've got some levers like that that we can pull to help alleviate
whatever that slide's indicating currently. So, yes, we're not panicked about our balance sheet or anything like
that. We think we've got a great opportunity when rates begin to move. Most of my liability sensitivity is tied
around loan floors. So, it's all about that. Once we can get a better view of where our rates move, we can always
start moving around on loan floors and cure the problem.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And then circling back on the loan growth and the outlook, definitely appreciate the guidance. It's
kind of a bottom-up review with all the lenders in the bank, curious how do [indiscernible] (01:04:03) utilizations
rates look today compared to levels a few years ago? Just kind of appreciate if that does rebound, how much
incremental benefit we could see from loan balances at the bank? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Utilization, I think, is at 43%, down from 46%, something like that. So those would be loans that are
currently on our books. Not anticipating a big growth in utilization so all of our growth, we think, is going to have to

come from loans that are currently – not all of it, but most of our growth is going to have to come from loans that
are currently on somebody else's balance sheet [indiscernible] (01:04:40).

Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Hi, Cath. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Wanted to start a follow-up on the GAAP NII guide. How much PPP do you expect to come through in 2021 within
that guide?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, that's a great question. And we see each other up on trying to anticipate how much PPP. I've got – you can
calculate the interest income with where that might pay down to, but it's all about the forgiveness. And we've got
about $63 million in additional accretion to come to us. We think a lot of that's going to come this year. It's
probably more than 50% of what we likely will realize this year, maybe upwards to 70% of it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, great. And then as we think about...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I think the big news – Catherine, I think the big news we got out of a – when we talked to our relationship
managers is they're not hearing anybody say they're not going to go for forgiveness. So, I think most, if not all, of
that $2.2 billion is hanging out there on our balance sheet would likely find its way to forgiveness. And I would
imagine it's going to be more sooner than later, because I do believe sometime in the near future the loans last
year, they're going to get into principal pay-down loan here soon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then, as you think about the big picture PPNR growth, [indiscernible] (01:06:31) a
couple quarters ago where we looked at PPNR per share kind of ex-BHG, ex the excess liquidity and ex the PPP.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Do you think this is a year where PPNR ex those three variables can grow, or is it more BHG is kind of helping
you fund this expense growth this year, and maybe that's more of a kind of a next year thing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, there's no question, BHG is helpful. But also reserve release and provision expense is also helpful to help
fund some of that incentive growth. So, that dynamic is very much present. The PPNR growth for all banks is
relatively benign this year and in most cases it's negative. So, we've challenged our folks. We think with a fair
target it'll be positive. And hopefully, we can work our way through it to see at least some incremental growth and
big top quartile [indiscernible] (01:07:42).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then if I get you one more just for Tim, Tim, what's the path to moving loans off criticized?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy H. Huestis A
Chief Credit Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Catherine, good question. As you know, the vast majority of that is our hospitality book. We go through
every hotel loan, when I say we, that's myself, our special assets manager and our CRE credit officers every
quarter, every single loan $5 million and greater. And I've been thinking about that in particular with the hospitality
book. We may have some moving off to criticized this quarter, second quarter. We'll have some, I think more third
quarter and more fourth quarter, but they're still, Catherine, may be a part of that book that we'll take until early
2022. So, I think you'll start to see it accelerate in terms of positive migration out of criticized back into past. You'll
see that start this quarter and accelerate third and fourth quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. That sounds great. Thanks and great quarter.

Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to touch on the fact that BHG is significantly
adding to their staff this year and this reports that they may look into point of sale ending at their home
improvement stores. Can you guys just clarify what the plans are there and where that stands? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Michael, I think what they think their hiring plans will be similar to last year for 2021 and then they got similar
hiring plans for the next few years. I think they added 100 or 110 people in 2020. So, they anticipate a similar

number this year. The point of sale, they are looking at all kinds of new product verticals and that's one of them.
So, yes, they are definitely looking at it and they are building plans to go after that market.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. I thought they had employees, kind of about 800, and they're going to add about 650 this year. What you're
saying sounds a little bit different, I guess. Was the article that I read about wrong or just what has that been?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think as we talked before, that article was written off of an Internet-based thing that talked to the marketing
guy. I think they'll get to the 650 over the next few years. But as it stands right now, I think the number for this
year is somewhere around 100 to 125 employees.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Helpful. And then maybe just back to the NII guide this year, it does seem like the PPP fees will be higher
and then kind of the core will be lower. When – can you reconcile that to us versus 90 days ago? And then are we
at a point where ex-PPP that the NII will grow up from here, is that the expectation?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, we're very hopeful that core net interest income ex-PPP will grow with core loan growth for sure. Right now,
we're going to stick with our forecast that NII growth will be high-single-digits for this year.

Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Thank you. Can I circle back to the M&A topic, Terry? Just curious you said that the higher currency makes M&A
a little bit more attractive. Can you talk about what kind of properties would be of interest to you right now from a
size, geographic standpoint? We know you're kind of biased towards with more commercially-oriented properties.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I appreciate that [indiscernible] (01:11:59) about the topic [indiscernible] (01:12:01) why I think people
understand what I'm trying to say to them. So, anyway, I appreciate the question. I think on M&A, it's just obvious
that if you have a stock to trade, the tangible book value is not much of an option [indiscernible] (01:12:18) versus
peers that creates the opportunity to consider.

To your question about what kinds of things would be considered? I think you got your whole range of options that
I think everybody in the industry is considering own M&A, which would include strategic combinations in
[indiscernible] (01:12:37), acquisitions, [indiscernible] (01:12:39). So you got the whole realm of things that could
be looked at there. I think when you get down into, make an acquisition, my own sense, Jennifer, is that I'm not
interested in doing a lot of acquisitions that wouldn't produce something close to double-digit accretion and
earnings accretion. And so, you can make your own assumption zone. So what does that mean? But just sort of
back of the envelope math, I think it means you've got to buy at least $7.5 billion organization to – that creates a
kind of the impact. And so, you know this as well as I do. It's not like [indiscernible] (01:13:20) there. They're going
where that threshold of, as you say, being in a maker of the market, having commercial orientation and producing
that level of accretion. So hopefully that would shape what our considerations are.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Most of my stuff has been answered. Just one or two things, Harold.
Just on the going back to the expense guide for a minute. If you look at last quarter just kind of how you're
thinking about it versus kind of, hey, laid it out this quarter. And the bottom line impact, is there much change? I
think last quarter was high-single-digit growth off of last year's base of around 5.70%, 5.80%, and now this quarter
you kind of tweaked it to be 2% to 3% on the comp and then a decrease elsewhere. But just can you – when you
get to kind of the net number of what you're thinking about, is it still a similar spot to that 6.25% type of range, is
that how it still shapes out with the new guide?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think so, Brian. I don't think it's moved much between the end of last year and current.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. So, it's similar guide. Okay. And then just one of the questions kind of, Harold, I mean if the loan
forgiveness, the PPP occurs, I mean it's most of that coming back in the cash and until you can redeploy it, or
how is it changing the size of the balance sheet, I guess is, is it currently different now than it was previously?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I don't think so, Brian. I think as those loans paid down, we'll try to deploy that cash into new loans
someway somehow. Is that what your question was about?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Yeah. Just kind of the average earning assets, I mean, I guess, as the loans get forgiven and it comes back to
cash, they're coming back to cash right now until you can redeploy. That's kind of what's continuing to occur?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think so. There's no doubt that we'll have additional liquidity from the PPP credits, and hopefully, we can
get the loan engine moving and be able to get that money redeployed quickly.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. All right. And then just one last one for Terry. Just on that last question on the M&A period, I
understand what you're saying. Just geographically it's still – I mean I guess, is there more focus or more interest
in – I know it's a limited number of targets, but would there be more interest in adding to your existing footprint, or
I guess, is it more likely that you would have to go to – likely go to a different market than you're currently in, given
how you've talked about how much opportunity there is within your existing footprint?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I would say it's – I guess, again, Brian, to go back and think about the size of the acquisitions that we have
to make, those things are and so forth. I think you have to draw a conclusion that you most likely go to different
markets in existing markets. But again, I'm not ruling that out. I'm just saying...

Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
...it seems like you find more opportunities in additional markets than you do in existing markets that would meet
that criteria.
