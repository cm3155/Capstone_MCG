President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Thanks very much, John. Good morning, everyone. I'll make some brief comments about our 2021 results, the
operating environment and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review fourth quarter
results and some of our expectations for 2022, before we take your questions.
Let me start with some 2021 highlights. We earned $21.5 billion or $4.95 per common share in 2021. Expenses
declined 7% from a year ago, reflecting lower operating losses and progress on our efficiency initiatives. Revenue
increased 6%, as we benefited from strong gains from equity securities and gain from sales of our Student
Lending, Asset Management and Corporate Trust businesses. We also have broad-based revenue growth across
our businesses, including Home Lending, Consumer and Small Business Banking, Credit Card, Auto, Commercial
Real Estate, Banking and Wealth and Investment Management.
Credit quality improved significantly, as the economy improved and our customers had high levels of liquidity. Our
loan charge-off ratio declined from 35 basis points in 2020 to 18 basis points in 2021, and our allowance for credit
losses declined by $5.7 billion.
Deposits increased $78 billion or 6%, and loans grew 1%, with declines in the first half of the year offset by a 5%
increase in the second half. We also returned a significant amount of capital to our shareholders, including
increasing our common stock dividend from $0.10 per share to $0.20 per share in the third quarter, and we
repurchased $14.5 billion of common stock, predominantly in the second half of the year, after the return to the
SCB framework.
Our results in the fourth quarter also showed continued broad-based momentum. We earned $5.8 billion or $1.38
per common share. We grew loans by $32.6 billion or 4%, and deposits by $12.1 billion or 1% from the third
quarter. Expenses declined 1% from the third quarter, and 11% from a year ago, and we generated positive
operating leverage over both periods. Most importantly, we continued to prioritize our risk and control work, and
the strong economy continues to positively impact our customers and our results. Consumers continue to have
more liquidity than prior to the pandemic, though we do see this declining as the median balances today are 27%
higher than pre-pandemic levels, but are down 10% from the third quarter.
Consumer credit card spend also continued to be strong, up 28% from the fourth quarter 2020, and up 27% from
the fourth quarter of 2019. Holiday sales were strong, with spending up 31% the three weeks leading up to
Thanksgiving, and that momentum continued post-Thanksgiving. All spending categories were up in the fourth
quarter compared to a year ago, with the largest increases in travel, fuel, entertainment and dining.
Weekly debit card spend during the fourth quarter was up every week compared to both 2019 and 2020. This
increase was driven by higher transactions, but also higher spend per transaction, reflecting inflationary impacts
and increased spending in higher cost categories such as travel.
We are watching the impact from Omicron on consumer spending and while there is some softening in restaurant,
travel and entertainment in recent weeks, overall spending remains strong in the first week of January, with credit
card up 26% and debit card up 29% versus the same week in 2020. And we saw strong loan growth from the third

quarter across our commercial businesses, including Commercial Real Estate, Asset-Based Lending, Middle
Market Banking and our Markets and Banking businesses.
So, I've been at the company for a little over two years now, and I thought I'd spend a few minutes giving you my
thoughts on our progress. Overall, I feel great about what we've accomplished and continue to feel energized
about the opportunities in front of us. I think about this along several dimensions: talent, leadership and culture;
risk, regulatory and control; financial and strategic progress; and our work on ESG and broader reputational
issues.
I have spoken of the substantial talent changes we've made. But just to remind you 11 of 18 members are new to
the operating committee, and two are new to their job since I arrived. Additionally, well over half of the senior-
most people at our company, meaning those who are one level below the operating committee, are new to their
roles, and a significant proportion of them were hired from outside the company. This is a dramatic change in our
leadership, and with it, we've changed how we run the company, how we prioritize our work and how we view our
responsibility broadly.
We began the process two years ago to change the culture and priorities of the company, and the most significant
part of this prioritization was the building and implementation of an effective risk and control framework across the
company. Our approach and our progress are entirely different than they were when I arrived. We are laser-
focused on meeting our own expectations and those of our regulators. We have clear plans in place and clear
owners for every regulatory deliverable we have. We have detailed reporting on how we're progressing on those
plans. We review this reporting every single week at the operating committee level. The detailed involvement of
the operating committee members is very different from what was happening before I arrived. Our ability to
identify issues has also improved from two years ago.
I continue to believe that we're making significant progress, and this is based on what we see in our internal
reporting. It doesn't mean that we're perfect. The fact that we have multiple consent orders makes it complex. It
takes time to build all of our capabilities. And it's certainly in the regulator's purview to look at issues that have
been outstanding for a long time like the OCC did in the third quarter. But I would point you to the comment made
by the OCC in their recent consent order that highlights that we have taken steps to comply with their 2018 order
and we're committed to addressing remaining requirements. I remain confident in our ability to continue to close
the remaining gaps over the next several years.
Having said that, it continues to be the case that we're likely to have setbacks along the way. But that doesn't
change the fact that we believe that the quality of the talent we now have and the processes we now have in
place will enable us to get the work done.
We're making progress increasing the earnings power of the company and have also begun to invest in a more
holistic and aggressive way to drive stronger organic growth in all of our businesses. We are just now beginning
to bring things to market that are differentiated, and a number of significant opportunities are exciting.
We're continuing to track to the financial return goals we've discussed. First, achieve a sustainable 10% ROTCE,
subject to the same assumptions we've discussed in the past and then target 15%. We continue to believe that
we will achieve a 10% during one of the quarters in 2022 on an annualized basis. To achieve this, we're
aggressively focused on driving efficiencies, and we're seeing net expense reductions after significant
investments in our control build-out and our businesses. We are aggressively returning excess capital to
shareholders now that we've returned to the SCB framework. We continue to manage credit well, and we're
seeing early benefits from higher interest rates, growing loan balances and higher fees in certain businesses.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 14-Jan-2022
We're doing this, while devoting significant resources to building our franchise. We have fallen behind in providing
competitive digital capabilities for our clients. This is changing. In the fourth quarter, we announced a rebuild
mobile banking experience for consumer and small business customers that is set to begin rolling out this quarter.
It has a new modern look and feel and a simpler user experience that will help our customers more easily
accomplish their banking needs. This platform is necessary to drive significantly higher digital adoption from our
customers.
Even with our existing capabilities, in the fourth quarter, our customers logged in 1.6 billion times using a mobile
device, up 7% year-over-year. Tele transactions remained more than 30% lower than pre-pandemic levels. We
also announced that later this year we'll be adding an all-new virtual assistant, Fargo, to the app. Customers will
be able to get answers to their everyday banking questions, ask Fargo to complete the task for them, and Fargo
will also provide personalized insights and recommendations to help customers better manage their finances. We
will also be introducing the first phase of the redesign of our public website early this year.
In addition, we're beginning to become more active on the wholesale side. For example, we announced that we're
collaborating with HSBC to optimize the settlement of foreign exchange transactions through a blockchain-based
solution, which will reduce settlement risks and associated costs. We're also approaching payments and credit
cards very differently. We believe credit cards will remain important, as both a credit and as a payment vehicle.
We are also doing additional working around non-card payments and believe we must succeed here to be a key
financial services provider.
Two years ago, our products and capabilities supporting those products were not as competitive as necessary. In
2021, we launched two products, including Active Cash which we believe is the best cash back product in the
marketplace, and Reflect, which rewards customers for on-time payments. We improved the core experience,
including investing in advertising, simplifying our digital application and enhancing our underwriting. These efforts
have driven an increase in digital card activation, paperless statements and enrollment alerts.
We are opening approximately twice as many accounts as we were prelaunch of these products. And importantly,
we're not competing on credit. In fact, the quality of applications and the accounts we're booking continues to be
better than what we were booking historically. Away from card, we're beginning to invest in our broader digital
payments across the platform, enhancing our capabilities, increasing limits and broadly reducing the friction in
moving money. As evidence, Zelle momentum continued to accelerate, with Zelle transactions up 46% from a
year ago.
We are also taking a very different approach in that we believe that for us to be successful, we must consider a
broader set of stakeholders in our decisions and actions. This is not in lieu of shareholders. In fact, we believe it
will enhance our returns to shareholders over time. We have taken significant efforts to support small businesses
since the beginning of the pandemic and recently fulfilled our roughly $420 million Open for Business Fund
commitment to assist small businesses in recovering from the pandemic by working with not-for-profits to offer
capital, technical assistance, and long-term programs, the fund that was created by donating the gross processing
fees we made from administering the Paycheck Protection Program loans in 2020.
Additionally, we made significant climate commitments in 2021. In the fourth quarter, we joined the Net-Zero
Banking Alliance, an industry-led leadership group designed to foster collaboration and support banks in aligning
their financing with the goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change is one of the most
urgent environmental and social issues of our time, and last year, we announced our goal to achieve net-zero

greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions attributable to financing by 2050. We expect to announce our first
financed emission targets for the oil and gas and power sectors later this year.
We made our first solar-plus battery storage tax equity commitment. Once it is operational, it will be one of the
largest solar and battery projects in the company. Last year, we surpassed $13.3 billion in cumulative tax equity
investments in nearly 600 wind, solar, and fuel cell transactions. These investments have provided 13% of all
utility-scale wind and solar capacity in the US over the past 16 years.
We continue to be one of the top investors in affordable multi-family housing in the US, as well as an active lender
for affordable rental housing developments. Additionally, we're committed to expanding affordable
homeownership. For example, in the fourth quarter, we committed to invest $5 million through the
NeighborhoodLIFT program to help more than 300 low and moderate income residents in Houston with home
down-payment assistance.
We've also supported our employees, and in December, we announced that as part of our commitment to
providing comprehensive benefits and competitive pay, we're increasing US minimum pay hourly pay levels to a
range of $18 to $22, effective at the end of this month. Just this week, we announced new efforts that will roll out
over the course of 2022 to help our consumer customers avoid overdraft fees and cover short-term cash needs,
building on other changes we've made over the last several years.
The changes we announced include the elimination of transfer fees for customers enrolled in overdraft protection,
the elimination of non-sufficient fund fees, early access to direct deposit by providing customer access to funds up
to two days before their scheduled deposit, a 24-hour grace period for customers that overdraw their account to
cover the balance before incurring an overdraft fee, and a new short-term credit product for customers to meet
personal financial needs.
This builds on existing features we already have in place, including Clear Access Banking, our no-overdraft
checking account that we launched in September 2020, and we now have over 1.1 million outstanding customer
accounts; Overdraft Rewind, which was introduced in 2017, which automatically rewinds overdraft fees when a
covering direct deposit is received by the next morning, which will be replaced by our expanded 24-hour grace
period; Balance Alerts, that help customers avoid overdrafts by sending more than 1.3 million alerts every day.
Putting all of these changes in perspective, these fees are down significantly since the financial crisis. We have
alternatives for both customers that do not want to overdraft and those that do. This is a competitive marketplace.
We continue to review our capabilities and pricing with the goal of providing value to our customer.
And let me make a few comments now as we look forward. While there is a risk with continued growth of the
Omicron variant or potentially other variants later this year, I expect to see continued strong economic trends in
2022. Consumers' financial condition remains strong. Modest debt growth, strong asset appreciation, and higher
deposit balances have left household balance sheets in excellent condition, which should help drive continued
strong consumer spending. Corporate America has demonstrated the ability to adapt to the ever-changing
pandemic conditions. Inventories remained unusually lean, as businesses adopted a defensive posture, and
supply chains have been disrupted. This is expected to result in substantial gains in industrial production as they
continue to restock. We're beginning to see loan growth and expect this to continue.
In a moment, Mike will provide our thoughts on net interest income and expenses for 2022. I commented earlier
that we remain on target to achieve a sustainable 10% ROTCE, subject to the same assumptions we've
discussed in the past on a run-rate basis at some point this year. And that once we've achieved this goal, we'll

discuss our plan to continue to increase returns. But at a high level, we continue to believe we can further improve
our returns through a combination of factors, including a modest increase in interest rates or further steepening of
the curve, ongoing progress on incremental efficiency initiatives, a small impact from returns on growth-related
investments in our businesses, continued execution on our risk and regulatory control framework, and moderate
balance sheet growth once the asset cap is lifted. It's important to note we currently have the ability to grow loans
even under the asset cap.
The changes we've made to the company and continued strong economic growth prospects make us feel good
about how we're positioned entering 2022. But we also remain cognizant that we still have a multiyear effort to
satisfy our regulatory requirements, with setbacks likely to continue along the way, and we continue our work to
put exposures related to our historical practices behind us. As we look forward, we will continue to be aggressive
in driving progress and improvement in our performance, embrace our responsibility to our customers and
communities, and I remain incredibly optimistic about our future.
I want to conclude by thanking our employees who continue to serve our customers through another challenging
year. I appreciate their hard work and their resiliency while we made progress on making Wells Fargo better. I
look forward to all that we accomplish in the year ahead.
I will now turn the call over to Mike.

Michael P. Santomassimo
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Great. Thanks, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Charlie summarized how we helped our customers,
communities, and employees last year on slides 2 and 3, so I'm going to start with our fourth quarter financial
results on slide 4. Net income for the quarter was $5.8 billion, or $1.38 per share – common share. Our fourth
quarter results included a $943 million net gain on the sales of our Corporate Trust Services business and Wells
Fargo Asset Management. There could be future gains related to these sales due to post-closing adjustments and
earn-out provisions, an $875 million decrease in allowance for credit losses, as credit trends continue to be
strong, and a $260 million (sic) [$268 million] (00:20:46) impairment of certain leased rail cars due to changes in
demand for these cars.
We also had $2.5 billion, or $1.9 billion after non-controlling interest of equity gains, primarily from our affiliated
venture capital and private equity businesses, the third consecutive quarter of strong returns in these businesses.
Our effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter was approximately 23%, including the discrete impacts related
to business divestitures.
Our CET1 ratio declined to 11.4% in the fourth quarter, reflecting share repurchases and an increase in risk-
weighted assets, primarily from loan growth in the quarter. We repurchased $7 billion of common stock in the
fourth quarter, partially offset by $1.4 billion of new issuances, predominantly for the annual matching contribution
for our 401(k) plans. As a reminder, the regulatory minimum for our CET1 ratio will be 9.1% in the first quarter of
2022, reflecting a lower G-SIB capital surcharge.
Turning to credit quality on slide 6, our net charge-off ratio was 19 basis points in the fourth quarter. Commercial
credit performance continue to be strong, with net loan charge-offs declining $10 million from the third quarter to 2
basis points. Despite the challenges created by the pandemic, the Commercial Real Estate portfolios continue to
perform well. Commercial Real Estate valuations and investment activity has rebounded off their lows across all
property types although there are still some risk in office and select hotel and retail segments.

Consumer credit performance also remained strong, with higher collateral values for homes and autos, and
consumer cash reserves remain above pre-pandemic levels. Consumer net charge-offs of $393 million increased
$172 million from the third quarter. $152 million of the increase is related to a change in practice to fully charge off
certain delinquent legacy residential mortgage loans.
Non-performing assets increased $145 million or 2% from the third quarter, driven by an increase in residential
mortgage non-accruals, primarily resulting from certain customers exiting COVID-related accommodation
programs. Loans that were modified in 2021 upon exiting forbearance are reported as non-accrual until they
perform for a period of time. Overall, early performance of loans that have exited forbearance have been in line
with our expectations.
After increasing during the first four quarters of the pandemic, commercial non-performing assets have declined
for four consecutive quarters, and we're back to pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter. Our allowance level at
the end of the fourth quarter reflected continued strong credit performance, the ongoing economic recovery and
the uncertainties that still remain. If the economic recovery continues, we would expect to have additional reserve
releases.
On slide 7, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 2% from the third quarter, with growth in both our
Commercial and Consumer portfolios. We had strong growth late in the quarter, and period-end loans grew $32.6
billion or 4% from the third quarter, with broad-based growth across most of our Commercial and Consumer
portfolios. I'll highlight the specific growth drivers when discussing business segment results.
Average deposits increased $89.9 billion or 7% from a year ago, with growth in our Consumer businesses and
Commercial Banking, partially offset by continued declines in Corporate and Investment Banking, in Corporate
Treasury, reflecting targeted actions to manage under the asset cap.
Turning to net interest income on slide 8, a year ago, we provided our expectation for 2021 net interest income to
be flat to down 4% from the originally reported annualized fourth quarter 2020 level. And we ended up being down
3% for the full year.
Fourth quarter net interest income was down $93 million, or 1%, from a year ago and grew $353 million, or 4%,
from the third quarter. The increase in the third quarter was driven by higher loan balances, including higher
interest income from loans purchased from securitization pools or EPBOs. We also benefited from higher trading
assets and a favorable funding mix.
In the fourth quarter, we had $318 million of interest income associated with EPBOs, and at year-end we had a
total of $17.3 billion of these loans, down from $34.8 billion a year ago. And as I highlighted last quarter, we
expect these balances to decline substantially by the end of this year.
We also had $130 million of interest income in the fourth quarter from Paycheck Protection Program loans, or
PPP loans, and were outstanding – and their outstanding declined to $2.4 billion at year end. We've reflected the
headwind from these portfolios running off in our 2022 net interest income waterfall that I will review later on the
call. The net interest margin increased 8 basis points from the third quarter, 3 basis points of which was due to
higher interest income from EPBOs.
Now turning to expenses on slide 9, non-interest expense declined 11% from a year ago. The decrease reflected
progress we made on our efficiency initiatives, including reductions in personnel costs, consultant spend and

occupancy expense. I will provide specific examples of the progress we made in our efficiency initiatives in 2021
later on the call before updating you on our expense expectations for 2022.
We also had lower restructuring charges and operating losses in the fourth quarter compared with a year ago.
Fourth quarter expenses included one month or approximately $100 million of operating expenses from our
Corporate Trust Services business and Wells Fargo Asset Management prior to their sale on November 1.
Now turning to our business segment, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on slide 10. Consumer and
Small Business Banking revenue increased 4% from a year ago, primarily due to higher deposit-related fees, as
fourth quarter of 2020 included some COVID-related fee waivers. Fourth quarter 2021 also reflected an increase
in consumer activity, including higher debit card transactions compared with a year ago, and the benefit of strong
deposit growth was largely offset by lower spreads.
Charlie highlighted the enhancements and changes we're making to help our customers avoid overdraft fees. The
impact from the fees that will be reduced, including the elimination of non-sufficient fund or NSF fees as well as
overdraft protection transfer fees is estimated to be approximately $700 million annually.
Also, we expect that they may be partially offset by other fees due to higher levels of activity as well as the
expiration of various fee-related waivers that were in place in 2021. In terms of new features to be rolled out in the
latter part of the year, including a 24-hour grace period for overdrafts and a new short-term loan product, we will
have to observe how customers respond.
Home Lending revenue declined 8% from a year ago, primarily due to lower mortgage banking income driven by
lower gain on sale margins and origination volumes. Even before the recent rate back up, we started to see a
drop in application volume in December, and we expect originations to decline in 2022, which will put pressure on
margins as the industry adapt to the lower volume.
Credit Card revenue was up 3% from a year ago, driven by higher point-of-sale volume, partially offset by higher
rewards cost, including promotional offers on our new Active Cash card. Auto revenue increased 17% from a year
ago on higher loan balances, with the average balances up $6.8 billion.
Turning to some key business drivers on slide 11, our mortgage originations declined 7% from the third quarter.
We expect our first quarter originations to continue to decline, due to lower refinance activity and the typical
seasonal slowdown in the purchase market. We increased our non-conforming originations in the fourth quarter
and have grown our non-conforming portfolio for seven consecutive months, reflecting the improvements in our
capabilities as well as the reintroduction of cash out refinancing late in the first quarter of 2021.
Turning to Auto, limited vehicle inventories continued to constrain industry new car sales. However, we had our
third consecutive quarter of record originations, with volume up 77% from a year ago, with the majority of our
originations coming from used cars. Originations also benefited from the enhancements we continue to make in
our capabilities. Importantly, we are maintaining our underwriting standards and continue to be cautious about the
increase in vehicle prices over the last year or so.
Turning to debit card, transactions were relatively stable from the third quarter and up 10% from a year ago, with
increases across nearly all categories. Credit card point-of-sale purchase volume continued to be strong and was
up 28% from a year ago and 11% from the third quarter. While payment rates remain elevated, balances grew 5%
from a year ago due to strong purchase volume and the launch of new products. New credit card accounts more

than doubled from a year ago, driven by our new Active Cash card, and we're pleased by the quality of the
accounts we've been attracting.
Turning to Commercial Banking results on slide 12, Middle Market Banking revenue increased 2% from a year
ago. Results included higher deposit balances and modestly higher Investment banking fees, partially offset by
the impact of lower interest rates. Asset-Based Lending and Leasing revenue increased 1% from a year ago,
driven by higher net gains from equity securities and higher revenue from renewable energy investments, partially
offset by lower loan balances.
Non-interest expense declined 10% from a year ago, primarily driven by lower personnel and consulting expense
due to the efficiency initiatives as well as lower lease expense.
Loan balances started to increase late in the third quarter and now have grown for four consecutive months, with
growth accelerating in December. As with other portfolios, we are adhering to the same credit risk appetite.
Increases in the Middle Market Banking were driven by growth from our larger clients, a modest uptick in revolver
utilization and strong seasonal borrowing. Growth in Asset-Based Lending and Leasing was driven by new client
wins as well as increased levels from higher prices and some increases in inventory levels.
Turning to Corporate and Investment Banking on slide 13, Banking revenue increased 17% from a year ago.
Investment Banking had a strong quarter, with higher debt origination and advisory fees. Banking results also
benefited from higher loan balances.
Commercial Real Estate revenue grew 8% from a year ago, driven by higher loan balances and capital markets
results on stronger commercial real estate financing activity. Loan originations returned to pre-pandemic levels,
and we had a healthy pipeline as we started the new year.
Markets revenue was relatively stable from a year ago, was down 14% from the third quarter, primarily due to
lower trading activity in spread products and equity derivatives. Average deposits in Corporate Investment
Banking were down $23.7 billion from a year ago, driven by actions taken across all lines of business to manage
under the asset cap. Average loans increased from both the third quarter and a year ago across all lines of
business. On a period-end basis, loans grew every month since June and growth accelerated in December.
Wealth and Investment Management on slide 14, the revenue grew 6% from a year ago as higher asset-based
fees on market valuations more than offset a decline in net interest income due to lower interest rates. The 5%
increase in expenses from a year ago was primarily driven by higher revenue-related compensation, which was
more than offset by higher revenue. This increase was partially offset by lower salaries expense reflecting
progress on efficiency initiatives.
Client assets reached a record $2.2 trillion, up 9% from a year ago, primarily driven by higher market valuations.
Average deposits were up 7% from a year ago, and average loans increased 5% from a year ago, driven by
continued momentum in securities-based lending.
Slide 15 highlights our Corporate results. Revenue increased from a year ago, driven by strong results in our

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 14-Jan-2022
We expect approximately $200 million of these expenses associated with transition services agreements to
remain in 2022 with offsetting revenue, so it's P&L neutral. We also expect approximately $300 million of
corporate overhead expenses related to these businesses to remain in 2022, which we expect to manage down
over time.
Turning now to our expectations for 2022, starting with net interest income on slide 16, as the last couple weeks
have demonstrated, it's challenging this early in the year to predict the rate environment, loan demand and other
variables that impact net interest income for the full year. But let me highlight the key drivers of our net interest
income for 2022.
We are assuming the asset cap will remain in place throughout 2022. Moving left to right on the waterfall, as
we've discussed previously, we have a headwind this year from the runoff of PPP and EPBO loans; however, our
current outlook for loans is for average balances to grow low-to-mid-single digits from the fourth quarter of 2021 to
the fourth quarter of 2022. Along with other balance sheet/mix changes, this is expected to more than offset that
headwind. This net result would increase net interest income approximately 3% in 2022 from the $35.8 billion we
generated in 2021.
Moving to rates and repricing, the recent forward curve includes approximately three 25-basis-point rate hikes this
year, beginning in May. Assuming this were to play out, net interest income has the potential to grow up to an
additional 5%, resulting in approximately 8% in net interest income growth in 2022 versus 2021. That said, the
implied forward curve has changed a lot over the last month and a half, so it's very hard to forecast with any
certainty.
Another way to view our asset sensitivity is from the disclosure we provided in our third quarter 10-Q filing. It
showed that the estimated impact of an instantaneous 50 basis points increase in short-term rates would increase
net interest income by approximately $2.7 billion over the next 12 months. Ultimately, the amount of net interest
income we earn in 2022 will depend on a variety of factors, including the absolute level of interest rates, the
shape of the yield curve, loan demand and cash redeployment.
Now, turning to expenses on slide 17, we made progress last year on our efficiency initiatives, and we've
continued to identify new opportunities. Our portfolio of initiatives that includes realized and identified potential
gross saves has grown from approximately $8 billion to $10 billion and we are continuing to work across the
company. We expect to execute on our remaining identified initiatives over the next two to three years, and we'll
continue to invest across our businesses. Importantly, similar to last year, we are excluding from our efficiency
initiatives the resources needed to address our risk and control work, and we'll continue to add resources as
necessary to complete this important work.
We've been reducing expenses across our businesses, but let me highlight a few examples of the progress we
made last year. We eliminated management layers and increased span of control, a 20% decrease with
managers with low span of control. We completed approximately 270 branch consolidations in 2021, a
continuation of the progress we've made the last few years, with branches down 11% since 2019.
We've also optimized branch staffing levels to better reflect our customers – or how our customers are using our
branches. Within our technology organization, we reduced non-engineering roles by approximately 40%, driven
by accelerated adoption of the Agile framework, and head count across the company declined approximately 6%
from a year ago, excluding divested businesses.

In addition to reducing the number of branches, we also reduced our office real estate portfolio by approximately
7%, and occupancy expense was down 9% compared with a year ago. This year, we expect to continue to realize
savings from these initiatives and including an incremental 5% reduction in office real estate.
Additionally, the investments we're making in technology should drive improvements in Operations, Consumer
Banking, Consumer Lending and Commercial Banking. Importantly, these efforts should not only reduce
expenses but also improve the customer experience with enhanced fraud detection, more service – self-service
capabilities and faster underwriting decisions.
Now turning to our 2022 expense outlook on slide 18, following the waterfall from left to right, we reported $53.8
billion of non-interest expense in 2021. This was largely in line with our most recent guidance, except for higher
operating losses. We had approximately $500 million of expenses in 2021 related to business exits and
restructuring charges and the civil money penalty associated with the OCC enforcement action in September. We
also had approximately $1 billion of expenses in 2021 from the Wells Fargo Asset Management and our
Corporate Trust Services business, which were sold and that will not continue in 2022.
So, we believe a good starting point for the discussion of 2022 expenses is the $52.3 billion. We are assuming a
modest increase in equity markets this year and expect revenue-related expenses to grow by approximately $300
million. This includes expected increases in Wealth and Investment Management and Corporate and Investment
Banking, partially offset by expected declines in Home Lending, reflecting lower origination volumes.
Higher revenue-related compensation is a good thing, and the associated revenue will more than offset any
increase in expenses. We also expect approximately $500 million of wage and benefits-related inflationary
increases in 2022 above and beyond the normal level of merit and pay increases, driven by higher personnel
expenses, including the minimum wage increase that Charlie highlighted in other compensation changes.
Through our efficiency initiatives, we expect to realize approximately $3.3 billion of gross expense reductions in
2022. This reduction is expected to be partially offset by approximately $1.2 billion of incremental investments,
primarily related to higher personnel in expenses in Commercial Banking, Corporate and Investment Banking and
Technology, as well as increased spending on Risk Management. We also expect approximately $500 million in
increased spending in other areas, including higher FDIC insurance assessments, higher travel and entertainment
expenses, which were significantly lower in 2021 due to the pandemic.
Accordingly, our full-year 2022 expenses are expected to be approximately $51.5 billion, a net reduction of
approximately $800 million versus the $52.3 billion. Embedded in our assumptions are approximately $1.3 billion
of operating losses for 2022, which is the amount we had in 2021, excluding the $250 million associated with the
OCC enforcement action.
While we've made significant progress on working through legacy issues, as we previously disclosed, we still
have outstanding litigation regulatory issues, and related expenses could significantly exceed the levels we had in
2021.
We made substantial progress last year on executing our efficiency initiatives, but we still have significant
opportunity to get more efficient across the company. We are focused on achieving net expense reductions while
appropriately investing in our businesses. This remains a multi-year process with the ultimate goal of achieving an
efficiency ratio in line with our peers and based on our business mix.
We'll now take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: At this time, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first
question of the day will come from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. Sir, your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Hi. Good morning. Mike, I was wondering if you could give us some sense of, if the asset cap remains in place,
how much capacity do you have to grow loans? Obviously, the [ph] HA data (00:41:10) is picking up. It feels like
loan growth's getting better for the industry. I just want to make sure that you're invited to that party and you guys
can grow loans while staying under the asset cap.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, hey, John. Thanks for the question. So, just as you know, and I think it's implicit in what you asked, but the
constraint for us on the asset cap is really on the deposit side. And so that's the part where we're actively taking
action to make sure we've got the room we need to – particularly for our retail clients, and we're continuing to do
that. On the loan side, we still have – we're not constrained on growth on the loan side. So we still have plenty of
room to continue to grow with our clients.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
And could you give us some sense in your NII outlook what kind of loan growth are you building in, and also
liquidity deployment assumptions and how you're thinking about liquidity deployment given where the curve is
here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, sure. Embedded on slide 16, we've assumed that kind of low-to-mid-single-digit growth when you compare
fourth quarter 2021 to fourth quarter 2022. And so hopefully, we're optimistic that we'll be able to get there, and
maybe there's certainly some scenarios where it could be – it could grow faster than that. But that's the
assumption that we used there.
Embedded in that column too on the chart in the loan growth and other balance sheet stuff is some modest
redeployment into the securities portfolio, I'd say modest, so sort of single – low – kind of mid-to-low-single digit
sort of increases in the securities portfolio as well. And so those are the assumptions embedded there. And I think
as we look at where the curve is today, we're still being overall pretty prudent and patient, but we are in a very
kind of small way beginning to buy some securities in the portfolio.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 14-Jan-2022
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning, guys. Mike, you had mentioned that, well, you did a little bit better last year, $4 billion of
gross saves versus what you originally thought at $3.6 billion. And you just commented that you still have a good
line of sight as far as efficiency initiatives. Can you help us understand, Mike, $3.3 billion for this year, how you're
feeling about that? But more importantly, that line of sight, how far out do you have that? And do you continue to
see an ability to take out this type of cost as you go forward even past this year? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. No. And, Ken, what we're really trying to do is make sure we embed this in the DNA of how we operate the
place. And so that's ultimately what's going to be really important for us over the long run. And I think you're
seeing that. The portfolio grew from $8 billion to $10 billion in terms of the initiatives that we've either executed on
or about – or in the process of executing. And so I think you're seeing sort of that progress and growth there.
So you can sort of do the math of what we've accomplished so far, what we've identified for this year, and what's
left for next year. And I continue to believe that we've got more to do that we haven't sort of built into that portfolio
yet. And so the teams continues to work on that every day.
As you look at our confidence level on the $3.3 billion that we put into the forecast, we feel good. We've got really
good line of sight. And I think given what the team was able to do last year, we have confidence that we'll be able
to execute on that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Hey, Ken, [indiscernible] (00:44:50) let me just add to something that Mike said, which is I'm always – I'm a firm
believer on these efficiency initiatives, especially in a company like this. Even if you go back over a decade, one
of the strengths of this company was never efficiency. It was far more on the revenue side. And so, as we get the
efficiencies that we're starting to see, it is like peeling the onion back, where then, the next set of opportunities
become even clearer.
And so, we're ginning up the same process that we did at the beginning of this venture, where we came up with
the initial $8 billion to go back and say, okay, now what's next in a very methodical way across the company. So,
we feel – I feel really good about what's in our numbers for next year. And we're going to continue to pursue this.
And I think it's – just as like – just as you've seen in our numbers, it gives us the ability to spend our investments
and to become more efficient overall as a company. So, I personally don't feel like we're close to done.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got it. And if I can just ask the other side of that question, too, which is that you're doing a little less in the
incremental investments versus what you did last year, how do you get comfortable that you're doing enough,
especially what we're hearing from the industry pressures, not just inflation but just on the need to continue to?
And you mentioned this, Charlie, about all the new things you're rolling out, but how do you land on that number
and how do you get the confidence that it's the right amount that you're reinvesting?

Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. It's a good question. I think we do, I think, what most good companies do, which is they sit around tables
and they ask everyone to come back with what you want to spend money on, and then figure out what you can
actually do. I think we've accomplished a tremendous amount on the technology side since Saul van Beurden,
who runs technology for us, was brought in. And I think we're going to try and spend as much as we physically
can get done. But I think we're always asking the question of what's next.
But I think the different position that we're in versus others is we're still in the ramping up stage, which I also look
at as opportunity, because we have moved slower historically investing in some of these areas. And to the extent
that we find more efficiency money, it gives us the opportunity to spend more broadly. But I do feel that I think we
as a company – we as a management team do feel good about what we're investing next year relative to where
we stand as a company.

Betsy L. Graseck Q

Hi. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Hi, Betsy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I had two questions. One was on the overdraft fees that you mentioned. I think you said that it was like a $700
million impact. But we look at the regulatory filings, and the regulatory filings show a higher level of overdraft fee
run rate, like in the $1 billion kind of range. So I'm just trying to understand what – why it would be only $700
million.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Well, first of all, I mean, we're not eliminating overdraft fees. We're making a series of changes that we think make
sense for the consumer. We have an account that doesn't allow overdraft, but we have an account that does allow
overdraft. And so we think it's got – it's more consumer-friendly than it was in the past. But we do continue to
believe that there are a substantial number of customers out there that want us to pay overdraft on their behalf
after they've worked through a bunch of the buffers and benefits we're giving them, and they're willing to pay for
that.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. So, the NSF fees will be eliminated, but you'll have a different product that comes in?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Well, no, it's the same. NSF fees will be eliminated entirely. Our overdraft fee will stay. But we've added a series
of things, such as we'll give you availability on direct deposits two days in advance. We'll give you an additional 24
hours after you otherwise would have been charged for an overdraft to cure it. So, our overdraft fees will go down,
but we're still going to be providing the overdraft product and we'll still be charging for it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. All right. So, my bad. Because I thought overdraft and NSF were pretty similar, but that's not right, so I get
it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
No. Yeah, think of that – Betsy, think of the NSF fees as when you don't pay something into overdraft like a check
and you return it, then historically you would have charged a fee for that returned item. That's an NSF fee. The
overdraft fees come into play when you actually pay something in overdraft.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah, yeah, I got it. Okay. So, I was using too much shorthand, and that's my bad. All right. And then the second
question is on the loan growth that you were talking about earlier in the prepared remarks and with John. LIBOR
is no longer able to be used as a reference rate for C&I or CRE or any loan or any product, right, starting Jan 1.
How does that impact you? Is that – could that be a benefit to your loan growth in C&I and CRE? And how are
you thinking about shifting the reference rate that you're going to be using with your clients?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Well, I mean, we've started that shift already, as you would imagine, right? And we started – we stopped offering
new – effectively stopped offering new LIBOR-based loan products at some point in the fourth quarter. We've
probably done in the wholesale side maybe including wins, so take out the consumer mortgage business, we've
done something like 4,500 or just under that new facilities based on SOFR, with the large majority – and obviously
there's different ways to calculate. So, for a large majority of those, we're using sort of a daily simple rate. So, as
SOFR moves, obviously that will adjust.
And so, I think we're seeing clients start to get used to it and start to use it. Complementing what we're doing on
the wholesale side is we've got – we've stopped offering LIBOR-based ARMs last year, and so we've got tens of
thousands – couple tens of thousands at this point in terms of ARMs on the books using SOFR there as well. And
so, I think it's starting to take hold.

Operator: The next question comes from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS
Hi. Good morning. Mike, my first question is for you. Could you give us a sense of what deposit growth or runoff
assumption you have in your 2022 NII simulation? And similarly, what kind of deposit repricing you presume?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. Thanks, Erika. Look, as you can guess, we're in a bit of a different spot than others, right, given our asset
cap. And so, we're already constrained on deposits, and so we're pushing away deposits every week now. And
so, I don't expect in this year to have much of a runoff in deposits. And if we start to see deposit levels going
down, we'll stop pushing others off. And so, I don't see that going to be a big driver for 2022.
As you think about betas or – and deposit pricing assumptions, it's largely similar to what we saw the last rate
cycle. But I would say that over the last three, four, five years, our deposit base has changed quite a bit. If you
look at just based on the segments we are in, as a shorthand, where 57% of our deposits are in our Consumer

and Small Business Banking business today. If you go back a number of years, that was probably closer to 43%
or 45%.
And so, the remixing of sort of our deposits as a result of some of the actions we've had to take will kind of lower
the overall beta for the first number of rate hikes. But I think it will look pretty similar to what we saw. And as you
can imagine, since we're constrained on growing deposits, we're not going to be the leader on pricing likely as we
go over the next number of quarters.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS
And just to clarify, so the betas in the last cycle, if I remember, were driven by a handful of CIB deposits, right?
And clearly that has been pushed out given assets – some of that has been pushed given asset cap restrictions.
So, embedded in this NII number is the experience of the last cycle that included the betas contributed by those
deposits, whereas as we actually look out today, you have a much better and less rate-sensitive deposit base.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
For sure. And the betas might be similar on the CIB deposits. We just have less of them as a percentage...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

It's just the mix.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A

on those wholesale deposits. But it will have a smaller impact on us than it did in the past just given the mix.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS
Understood. And my last question is for Charlie. I think your investors are receiving very warmly what you and
Mike have said about you're trying to change how this bank is thinking by constantly identifying cost saves to fund
future investments. And as we look out in what looks like a more favorable rate backdrop and revenue backdrop
from a growth perspective for banks, do you see yourself reinvesting more of the identified savings as we enter a
more favorable revenue backdrop?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
I don't think – I guess, the way I'd put it is we don't think about it relative to what the rate scenario is or how much
we're making in NII. I think, again, just think about where we are in the stage of our evolution, which is we're
limiting our investments based upon just what can physically be done, not based upon how much we actually
want to spend. I mean, there are always a couple of small places around the place where people want to spend,
and you do have to prioritize.
I think a lot of the answer to your question will have to do, as we continue to do our work strategically to determine
where we want to create additional capabilities across the company, we would expect the investment number to
grow for sure. But also, as you know, we're spending a lot of money on infrastructure. And I'm not talking about
the risk build-out. I'm just talking about the basic infrastructure of the company.
So, I think as we sit here today, we still think that we have an opportunity to both become much more efficient and
to continue to grow the level of investments that are going to drive business results inside the company. And that'll
– that's, I would say, is focused upon where we think we need to get to relative to how much money we should be
spending as a company as opposed to any upside that we have because of just the change in rates at this point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS
Got it. That's clear. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
And another reason I would add is I just think for us, that just – it takes the pressure off of us to think that – if we
were to think that way. If we were to say, okay, because of nothing we've done, rates have gone up, we'd then
start spending a lot more money. We're still in this – as I said earlier, we're still in this phase of challenging
ourselves to become as efficient as we should be. And that – having that pressure across the company at this
stage for us is still a good thing. Just as we're – it is to challenge people to come up with where we should be

Matthew O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. So, wanted to ask about the asset cap, and can you just remind us like where you are in the
process from your perspective? Have you implemented everything that you've submitted in your proposal and it's
just a matter of consistently executing on those changes? Or are there still, call it, material changes that you're
making to address those issues?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Matt, I understand you're very consistent in wanting to know the answer, and I certainly appreciate that. We have
– across all of this regulatory work, we still have a substantial amount to do. It's really not right for me to talk about
under any specific consent order where we think we are in the process. Because again, what I said ultimately is
what's going to matter is whether our regulators believe it's done to their satisfaction. And it's really unhealthy to
get into the game of do we think we're done, do we think they're making the right conclusions. I think it's on us to
continue to do all that's necessary. And when they're comfortable that we've satisfied those obligations, they will
make that determination. And so, I just – again, I'm sorry I understand why you seek more detail, but it's just a
difficult thing and probably not the right thing for us to get to that level of specificity.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
I appreciate that. And I know I ask this line of question kind of every quarter, but obviously it's such a key part for
the stock. And I know I've also asked this kind of follow-up question. I think you have like a slew of local regulators
on-site or at least on-site virtually. But I think there's a perception that it's kind of more of the central regulators
that are kind of going to be the ones that make the call. And just remind us in general what is like the frequency of
the dialogue with some more of those central regulators and just any flavor you can add on the communication
there. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
I think it's fair that – I think I would speak for most big banks that the level of dialogue with both local staff and with
DC is substantial and meaningful. I know I can just tell you even from my last role, it's the right thing to do. Again,
we certainly have increased, I think, the level of dialogue that we have since the new team has gotten here. And
it's hard to put specific – how often we do it. But it's very, very regular. And I think it's true that all of the big banks,
both the local staff as well as the staff in DC, are both extremely important in their monitoring and in the way they
draw conclusions about the company. And we work hard to treat both extremely respectfully. There's a very direct
and open communication on their side as far as I can tell. And as I said, we say the same to the local people as
we do to the DC staff. But again, they're a very, very important part of the journey that we're on, and we want
them to be as knowledgeable about what's going on here on all of these important issues. And we're always
available and willing to have those conversations with them.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 14-Jan-2022
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Mike, I wanted to ask in a little bit more detail about rate
positioning. I think I can figure this out mostly from your guide and disclosures but would still be curious to hear
your thoughts. Just with your significant asset sensitivity, can you talk a little bit about sort of where you're most
sensitive on the curve and sort of when and how you benefit? Like put simply, is the first hike the same benefit as
the third, and so on? Or where or when is it more or less powerful?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. And to state the obvious, probably, the short end of the curve is most meaningful, right? So when you look
at just the whole curve shifting up, something like two-thirds of the benefit ends up being on the short end. And so
that's going to be, by far, the most meaningful piece of it. I think for the first number of rate rises – it's hard to say
exactly how many – I think the first three or four, though, it's pretty linear. And you can use our disclosures as a
way to sort of model that. You get it earlier in the year – you get it in March, it's worth a quarter more than if you
get it in June, and so forth. And so, it's a pretty good guide at this point to use it that way.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then, just separately, one of the criticisms on the story over the past few years is,
there are a number of competitors, a lot of smaller banks out there that sort of suggest that it's still pretty easy to
steal talent and business from Wells Fargo. Your emerging loan growth seems to be running kind of contrary to
what has been that argument for the last couple years. Can you just sort of touch on that criticism and sort of
where you are in terms of comfort with sort of stability and growth of the workforce?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Listen, I feel great about the people that we have here. And I've listened to that for quite a while since I've been
here. And when I ask people for specifics, very little seems to come back. Listen, it's a very, very competitive
workplace. We lose people to competition. We hire people from competition of all sizes. I think I would say as I
said before, when you look at the team that we have in place, both at a senior level all the way down to people
that we cover customers, I feel great about it.
And I can honestly tell you we've – I'm trying to remember, Mike, keep me honest here. Have we sat around a
room and talked about, gee, oh my God, look at all the people that we're losing to these smaller competitors and
what we're going to do about it? That conversation hasn't happened. And we're very knowledgeable about attrition
that's happening at the company. So if a small company hires a banker, it might be a big deal for them. We're
lucky enough to have a very broad set of coverage officers. But that's not to say it's not competitive. So maybe
they're right. But we feel good about the people that are here, and we're going to work hard to keep the people
that are here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, and I would just add a little color. We've been happy at what we've been able to recruit in places like the
investment bank. We've hired almost a few probably two to three dozen sort of relatively senior investment
bankers. We've hired a bunch of key people in the commercial bank on the front line. And so I think, as Charlie
said, it's definitely competitive and you could always find an anecdotal story of where somebody left to go do a

bigger job at a smaller place or so forth. But we feel – I think the teams feel good about being able attract good
people into the roles. And so, obviously, we've got to be competitive on pay. But I think people are attracted to the
franchise and attracted to the sort of direction. And so far, it's been constructive there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. And I just want to say one other thing, which is especially when you get down into places like the
commercial bank and our different businesses that cover consumers, as we've talked about having to improve the
talent in some parts of the company, the talent that we have in those areas is really exceptional. And it's really
deep. And it's a huge strength of the company. It's been a strength of the company for a very long time. So, again,
I think that might tell you just how we think about the people that we have. And again, we never want to lose good
people. But it happens. But it's not something that we worry about hurting the franchise at this point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q

Operator: The next question will come from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. On the low-single-digit to mid-single-digit loan growth assumption, can you give us a little more
detail on how that breaks out among the products out there, core C&I versus Commercial Real Estate and
Consumer? And then separately, are there any areas of the loan book that you're really emphasizing at this point
or see an opportunity to ramp your activity similar to what you've been doing on the credit card side? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, look, it's a little bit of growth really across the board, John. And I think we're seeing opportunity really
everywhere. And if you look at on the card side, we are expecting to see some growth in the card side. Some of
that will be like true revolve balances. Some of that will be some of the intro balances coming off the new
products, which will start to really pay off at the end of next year into the year after. We've been really happy with
what we've seen in the auto space, which, in this environment, are pretty good assets, pretty short-lived assets
and high quality in terms of what we've seen there. So we see some continued opportunity to grow there.
And then on the Consumer side, you have to go a little bit – I'm sorry, on the Mortgage side, you have to go a little
bit below the covers. And if you look at the non-conforming space, we are seeing some growth there, which we
think will continue as we go into the year. That's offset by these EPBO loans going away. But nonetheless, we
see some growth there.
So it's really – and the – like I gave some color on the Commercial Banking stuff in my comments, and we do
expect some more opportunity in the multi-family and apartments and asset classes like that in Commercial Real

Estate. So, in places like Commercial Real Estate, we're being really targeted about it. And even where you see a
little limited growth in places like office in the quarter, and even in places like that, cash to equity ratios are up,
structures are better, spreads are better, given sort of what we've – the way we're managing that. So we're being
really cautious in that space, but I do think it will be a little bit of growth across the board if we're successful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then separately, on the buyback front, buyback came in a little bit better than we
had expected in the fourth quarter. Maybe you can just give us your thoughts on the outlook there, on your
appetite, buybacks, and also how you're thinking about the dividend here in terms of deployment. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, look, I think we've talked about this before. And we're maybe in a different spot than others just given some
of the constraints we have on the asset cap. But we still feel like we've got excess capital. You can see that in the
numbers yourself. We do expect that we'll continue to see some loan growth. So that will drive some RWA, and
so that – we've got to be thoughtful about that.
And so, as we laid out earlier last year, we said we would do at least $18 billion of buybacks through the four-
quarter period ending in the second quarter. That still is achievable, and we potentially have the opportunity to go
above that, if we decide that's the right path either this quarter or next quarter. So we'll look at sort of how we feel
with all the things we got to think about and make that decision.
As you sort of think about the dividend – and I think Charlie covered this a couple times last year is, you think
about a payout ratio that we hope to get to on a normalized basis, so take out some of the one-time things that
you see in the results, it's really kind of a 30% to 40% payout ratio is what we target over time. And that just takes
some time to get there. And so, I think we'll – ultimately that's the board decision in terms of when and how much
we increase the dividend. But we're still marching down that path, but it takes some time to get there.

David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, everyone. You've talked in the past about the operating expense savings being a multiyear plan
and – or initiative. And so, with your guidance this year in the $51.5 billion range, should we be expecting 2023
operating expenses to still be below that level?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, look, at this point as we think about it, our goal would be to see a net reduction next year. I think we'll
obviously give you more guidance on how that's progressing as we get towards the end of the year, and that will
be a function of what we think we can invest properly, and what inflation looks like and a whole bunch of factors.

But we're certainly given what our view on the efficiency side is targeting that, but we'll give you more guidance on
that later in the year. I don't know if you have anything to add.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then as a follow-up, a little bit longer down the road, once the consent orders are mostly in the
past, if you replace the cost today to improve and upgrade your internal operations with the expected cost to sort
of just maintain proper controls and risk management efforts, how much savings do you see there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, look, I think there is some savings there. But our focus now is getting the work done and getting all the stuff
in place and making sure it's operating properly. And so we're focused a little bit – we're being thoughtful about
how we implement that stuff, but our focus is a little bit less on making it the most efficient and optimized process.
So, we will get there when that stuff is all done and running for a while. But that's a few years off, I think, in terms
of really optimizing the risk and compliance [indiscernible] (01:13:12).

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi. Good morning. So I just wanted to squeeze one more question in here just on the fee outlook. A fair amount of
noise in the fee line this quarter. I know you didn't give an explicit fee guide for 2022, but as we reflect the impact
of business sales, the overdraft change, some weaker mortgage banking and normalization in equity gains, how
should we be thinking about the right jumping off point for fee income just looking ahead to next quarter in 2022
just more broadly?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Well, I think you just outlined it, to be honest. I think you just have to take each of the lines, right? And I know
we've talked about this on calls before. Like if you look at one of the biggest fee lines, you take the investment
advisory and other asset-based fees, that's a function of our client assets and what the equity market is doing
primarily. And so that's probably something that you can model. And we've got – that grew a bit as we went
through the year last year.
And then I think, as you said, we're in the mortgage space. We'll see some – the fourth quarter number in the
consumer side is probably a good place to start your jumping off point in modeling. And as I think others have
spoken about, too, is we all expect the mortgage market to be down with refinancings really driving that. And how

well we do will be a function of how well we're able to sort of penetrate on the purchase side. So, hopefully, we're
down a little less than what the market is. But that will be a function of what we can deliver. And so I think you just
got to take each of those lines and sort of model it forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thanks, Mike. And maybe I'll squeeze one more in if I can, just on the earlier discussion around excess liquidity
deployment, it looked like you deployed some of that excess in the quarter, and yet if I look relative to pre-
pandemic levels, you've still seen a doubling of excess reserves. And those deposits that you guys have on
balance sheet, as you noted earlier, should be stickier as the Fed initiates QT just given some of the changes in
deposit mix. I was hoping you could just size the amount of excess liquidity available for deployment today. And if
the long end continues to grind higher, is there any appetite or willingness to deploy more aggressively than that
mid-single-digit growth that's contemplated in the NII walk?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, I mean, the first thing we'll be looking at is how fast loans are growing, right? So obviously that's the place
you'd want to see that liquidity get deployed first to support customers. And so that will be a function of what we
think is going to happen over a series of quarters. And I think when you look at the securities portfolio, we have
done a lot in the last year, both in increasing our mortgage exposure, increasing our structured product CLO
exposure. The place that you saw the decline was really in the Treasury side, and so, given sort of what was
happening in the rate environment – and so I think you will see us start deploying more. And as I mentioned
earlier, we've started in a very small way already given sort of what we've seen over the last couple weeks.
And I think really how much – how fast we go or how much we go will be both a function of what we think is going
to happen with rates, but also how fast we think loans will grow. And so those two things I think will drive sort of
the pace. And at this point embedded in our outlook or considerations there we do expect a modest increase in
the portfolio. And so we'll see how – but we'll make that determination based on all the factors there that I
mentioned.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 14-Jan-2022
Listen, I think it's a great question. I think it's the question that everyone is asking. And I think the whole point
about joining these alliances is to ensure that we're all benefiting from each other's experiences and those that
have experienced this in other parts of the world to understand how to actually think about that.
What we're doing is we're going through how we think the impact of climate on a much longer term basis can
impact all of the different businesses from a risk perspective, but also understanding where the opportunities for
us are. And so, whenever we talk about where we're going on climate with our goal to get to net zero, I think
people too often jump to that means we're going to stop doing things. First of all, what we're trying to do is to
assure that we're doing everything we can to help all of our clients transition. And that doesn't mean walking away
from clients. It means helping them invest in areas, whether it is – and we can do that in lots of different ways
across the company with our own balance sheet or the public markets to invest in very, very different ways.
And I think what you'll start to see from us and others is a lot more disclosure on what the embedded risks are,
but also all the different things that we're doing to play our part in reducing emissions more broadly. So I just think
it's a question that I think we should continue to ask as we all continue to provide more significant disclosures
than we've all done in the past on the topic.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
I appreciate that. Thank you. And pivoting to the follow-up question on credit, obviously, your guys' credit is
fantastic, like the industry considering what we just came through. Can you give us some color on the reserve? I
assume as we normalize credit, you and your peers, how should we be looking at the reserve building over the
next – in 2022 going into 2023, the loan loss reserve building that is?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Well, let me start, Mike, and then you just pick up. I think, the one thing obviously I think you guys all know this is
not everyone starts at the same position when you look across what people have done with reserving across the
industry. I think we feel very good about where we are relative to what we're seeing. We all have to make
determinations, remember, on a forward looking basis as to what the embedded losses are. And I think everyone
has a got a different point of view on that on the way that looks. And I think we're at the – we're doing the right
thing. But I still think it's our assumptions are appropriate and conservative. And beyond that, remember, the idea
of looking forward in terms of what's going to change. In addition to just loan growth and making sure that we
provide for growth in the balance sheet, it's going to depend on the ultimate outcome of the performance of the
economy.
And so, as we sit here today, we feel very, very good about it. But it can take lots of different turns, and hopefully,
we're still insulated from some level of downturn from where we sit today, given the assumptions that we've made
because of the uncertainty that exists in the environment. So I'm not worried about where we are in 2022
personally, but I think as we look beyond that, it's a living, breathing calculation.
