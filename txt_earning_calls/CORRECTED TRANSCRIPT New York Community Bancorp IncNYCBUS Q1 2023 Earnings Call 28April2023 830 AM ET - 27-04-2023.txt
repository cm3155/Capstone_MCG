Thomas Robert Cangemi
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Sal. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Today, I would like to cover a few
topics with you: our first quarter 2023 operating results, the first as a combined company with Flagstar; how we
fared during the recent market upheaval; the Signature Bank transaction; and finally provide you with some
forward-looking guidance.
As you all know, the first quarter was a volatile quarter for the banking industry, and unfortunately, several good
financial institutions became victims of this volatility. While no financial institution is 100% immune from the
damage that the crisis in confidence causes, the New York Community fared very well during this period of turmoil
due to our diversified business model focusing on several core businesses; retail banking, commercial lending,
multifamily and commercial real estate lending, and the residential mortgage origination and servicing business.
We do not have any exposure to Cryptocurrency or Stablecoin related industries, nor do we have significant
relationships with financial technology companies. Moreover, during this time, our percentage of uninsured
deposits was amongst the lowest in the industry. Not only did we successfully navigate the market turmoil, but we
emerge from this in a stronger position when, on March 20th, we announced that our bank subsidiary, Flagstar
Bank, N.A., purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Signature Bridge Bank.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2023
This transaction is a game changer for us. Strategically, it builds upon the momentum created by our recent
merger with Flagstar and accelerates our transformation to a high performing commercial bank and improves our
deposit base and our overall funding profile while providing further loan diversification.
In addition we jumpstart our commercial middle market lending business and our relationship banking strategy the
transaction included several other businesses that were part of our longer term build out strategy, including the
broker dealer and wealth management business, and several new attractive lending vertical such as healthcare
and SBA lending.
Importantly, we also returned – retain virtually all of Signature's highly productive private client banking teams
predominately based in the New York region, along with those teams related to the recent West Coast expansion,
primarily based in California.
Everyone here at New York Community is extremely pleased to have them and the other channels in place with
Signature Bank join our team and we look forward to us doing great things together.
Lastly, the transaction is anticipated to be financially attractive, with expected EPS accretion of more than 20%,
whilst also significantly and immediately accretive to tangible book value per share. At closing, tangible book
value per share jumped 20% to $9.86 a share at the end of the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of last
year. Given our earnings power from this transaction, we expect tangible book value generation to accelerate.
Turning now to our results; first quarter 2023 results on a GAAP basis were impacted by several items arising
from the Signature transaction and the Flagstar acquisition, including an approximate $2 billion volume purchase
gain, merger-related expenses of $67 million, and initial provision for credit loss of $132 million for the loans
acquired from Signature.
Adjusted first quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.23 a share, slightly ahead of consensus estimates for
the quarter. Net income available to common stockholders as adjusted increased 14% to $159 million compared
to the fourth quarter of last year.
Operating results were driven by a full quarter's benefit from the Flagstar acquisition, which closed on December
1st of last year, approximately two weeks of Signature's operations, strong organic loan growth in the legacy
franchise, and a much higher net interest margin.
One of the many benefits from the Flagstar acquisition is the impact of our net interest margin from adding its
mostly variable rate loan portfolio and its low-cost deposit base. We saw some of this benefit in the fourth quarter,
but it was more pronounced this quarter.
As the net interest margin was 2.60%, up 32 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 202, we believe that
margin expansion will continue throughout the year with additional expansion opportunities from the Signature
transaction.
Turning to our loan portfolio; excluding loans acquired from the Signature transaction of approximately $12 billion,
total loans and leases increased $1.5 billion during the current first quarter, up about 9% on a linked-quarter
basis. About $1.1 billion of this growth was in the C&I portfolio, particularly in specialty finance and the mortgage
warehouse businesses.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2023
The loan portfolio continues to become more diversified as we continue our evolution to a commercial bank
model. Commercial loans at March 31st represented 44% of total loans, compared to 33% at December 31st
while multi-family loans stood at 46% of total loans, compared to 55%.
As for the quality of our loan portfolio; both our asset quality and metrics and trends remain strong. Total non-
performing assets of $161 million are up only modestly on a linked-quarterly basis and represents a low 13 basis
points of total assets. The allowance and credit losses increased to $159 million or 40% from the yearend to $549
million. And the coverage improves to 370% of non-performing loans or nearly 4 times. Importantly, we reported
another quarter of low or no loan losses and net charge-offs was zero during the current first quarter compared to
$1 million during the previous quarter.
Our office exposure remains very manageable and we remain comfortable with the credit trends in this sector.
Our office exposure at quarter end was $3.4 billion or approximately 4% of total loans. We provided some details
in our investor presentation, but to summarize, the average loan side is $11 million with a weighted average
coupon of 4.16%. The weighted average LTV is 56% and the weighted average debt service coverage ratio is
1.73 times. Furthermore, we have no delinquencies and no charges in this portfolio.
As you can see, these metrics are proof positive that our conservative underwriting standards have served us well
over numerous credit cycles. This, along with a high quality balance sheet, should serve us well in the event of an
economic downturn. Regardless, we will continue to be laser focused on credit quality across all the new verticals,
especially those that we have recently entered.
On the deposit front, our deposits totaled $84.9 billion at March 31st. The Signature transaction after experiencing
initial expected outflows contributed $31.5 billion of deposits as of quarter-end. Legacy Flagstar NYCB deposit
declined $5.4 billion due to anticipate spend down in the prepaid debit card program and the reserve account
withdrawal from Circle. All told, these two categories accounted for over 80% of the decline in legacy deposit
balances. Remaining were mostly institutional deposits.
In terms of liquidity, while we have always had ample sources of liquidity, our liquidity position was enhanced by
the $25 billion in cash from the Signature transaction. Currently, our available liquidity from cash, unpledged
securities, and the bond to cash both the FHLB of New York and the Fed is over $42 billion. At the same time, our
uninsured deposits, excluding collateralized deposits, totaled $28.7 billion or 34% of total deposits. Accordingly,
our ready liquidity represents 147% of uninsured deposits.
In addition to our diversified business mix, we have a conservative and high-quality available-for-sale securities
portfolio, consisting primarily of GSE-related securities. Approximately one-third of these securities were mark-to-
market in conjunction with the Flagstar acquisition. Accordingly, the amount of AOCI is amongst the lowest in the
industry and has minimal impact on capital. Also, as part of our long-term liquidity planning strategy, we do not
have any securities designated held to maturity.
In terms of our expenses, total OpEx were $398 million, up $194 million, compared to $204 million in the fourth
quarter. Our first quarter expense base includes a full quarter of Flagstar expenses, compared to only one month
during the fourth quarter, and 12 days of Signature.
As for guidance, given the current outlook, we expect first quarter 2023 NIM to expand from first quarter levels to
a range of 2.70% to 2.80%. First quarter gain on sale on mortgage loans of $20 million to $24 million, and a full-
year tax rate of approximately 23%.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2023
We've accomplished quite a lot in a relatively short period of time. We will devote the rest of this year to
integrating and converting Signature and Flagstar, reducing our expenses, growing our deposits further, and
building out each of our businesses as we evolve to become the new Flagstar.
Lastly, I'd like to thank all of our teammates for their hard work and support over the past few months, especially
the last few months none of what we have accomplished so far wouldn't be possible without them.
With that, we'll be happy to answer any questions you may have. We'll do our very best to get to all of you within
the time remaining. But if we don't, please feel free to call us later today. Operator, please open the line for
questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator
Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Please go
ahead. Your line is now live.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Ebrahim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Thank you. Good morning, Tom. So I guess maybe first question just around deposits the Slide 8 that you have
the waterfall, two things. One, give us a sense of what's underlying your assumption. I think I heard you say you
expect margin expansion not just in the second quarter but toward the year. So what's underpinning that in terms
of deposits, one, around legacy Flagstar. Do you expect more runoffs similar to what you saw, I think, in the early
part of the year, the $5.5 billion? How much more do you see leaving the bank there? And then on the Signature
deposits, I think they've held up much better than I would have thought. So give us a sense of what you expect
around the Signature deposit base.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, I'll start off Ebrahim, then I'll pass it over to John and Reggie, regarding the deposit base. But I would tell you,
given the timing of the transaction and the speed of execution, now, we modeled approximately the 20% run-off,
because given the circumstances of the turmoil going on in March, we felt that that was a conservative number.
We actually came in less than 10%, most important about that structure, I'm going to into April piece, and look at
what's the activity has been. The DDA activity has been – it's been a rock, it's been solid, it's been actually up
slightly throughout April.
And if you think about where we were a year ago, as a – as NYCB stand-alone, that was a $4 billion DDA balance
that went to approximately $12 billion of the Flagstar transaction. Now, we're $23 billion of DDA, or 27% of
deposit. So, if you think about how that impacts the margin, those costs are zero. So, that's a very powerful
position to be in, when we looked at the historical franchise, where we're more focused on higher cost-type
liabilities. So, we're very pleased on the stability of the DDA accounts. As far as the stability overall, we're seeing

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2023
a relatively flat position right now. We expected some runoff the first days, following the announcement, and it's
been very manageable.
With that, I'll pass the baton over to John, and then after John, he'll pass it to Reggie, to talk about what we're
seeing throughout the whole organization.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. And just quickly, if you – when we're talking about the margin guide, one of the items to keep in mind too is
on the borrowing side. So, we have $6 billion of a wholesale funding that is coming due, or we expect to be put
back to us in the second quarter. And that's at a $4.40 rate. So, we're going to get some margin benefit there by
just paying that down in the quarter.
We also have some brokerage CD runoff at pretty high rates as well. So, with the stability of the non-interest
bearing deposits that Tom talked about, and that Reggie will talk to quickly on the retail side, what we're looking at
– that's coming due and paying down, especially in the second quarter, is higher rate, wholesale borrowings and
brokerage CDs that we're going to pay down with the excess cash that we have on the balance sheet.
Reggie, anything you want to add on the deposit side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Reginald E. Davis A
Senior Executive Vice President & President of Banking, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I would just say I think the first quarter was actually a validation of just how stable our retail and core
wholesale book are. If you kind of look point to point, December 2022, we're only down 3% on a combined basis
across NYCB and Flagstar. So, that's like less than $1 billion on a $28 billion book. So, I would – I consider that a
win. And some of that, quite frankly, was kind of natural surge runoff and kind of what we see in the portfolio on a
run rate basis. So, I think the portfolio performed extremely well and would continue to perform this year the same
– in the same way.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So Ebrahim just a comment on that again, just to reiterate and going to the margin. If you think about the cash
position, and we're sitting on an abundance of liquidity and what the funding cost was that we've acquired to the
deposit side on Signature, net-net, I think a 3% carry which is above our current margin that's sort of sitting in
cash and just managing the cash flow as John indicated, paying off higher cost of debt as we go forward, that is
ultimately the strategy to have a much better funded balance sheet going forward here and more commercial
bank-like deposits.
So, the benefit of just sitting in cash right now is actually contributing to higher margin. But as we deploy it into
other businesses and higher yields and, more importantly, we focus on paying down some of the high-cost
wholesale liabilities to be more traditional funded, that will continue to see some good margin benefits throughout
the full year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And, I guess, just a second question, Tom. Talk to us around the alignment, and integration means
obviously you had to flex that integration going on with Signature. And you've kept a senior executive from

Signature, including Eric, on board. Give us a sense of how that integration is proceeding. What should we be
watching in terms of the success of like keeping those teams on board? And then, what does that mean for just
growth outlook going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, great question, Ebrahim. So obviously, day one, we hit the ground running. Both Eric and I have spent, you
know, significant energy on ensuring that we have the transition for the teams. We're very confident and very
happy on the result of that. As indicated in my prepared remarks, we preserved the teams both on the East Coast
and the West Coast, and also the business lines. All the lines of businesses are in place, and we're very pleased
on bringing them on board.
And when you think about the next step here, which is culture, culture, culture, we have to integrate these
companies culturally, and it's going to be a substantial amount of energy. But we are super excited about the
Signature folks coming on board. We know them well. We know that we know our competition, so we're clearly
working together.
And when it comes to systems, the Flagstar transaction is still scheduled for the first quarter of 2024 and we'll go
into a deep dive right now in assessing what's best for the bank and, more importantly, how the customers are
going to be served. So, it's also – it's all going to be about customer service as we truly take on a relationship
banking model. So, the most important aspect of that as we make these decisions that we integrate this at the
appropriate timeframe to ensure there's no customer disruption.
Mr. Pinto wants to add a little bit more on the integration side regarding Signature versus Flagstar. John?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. The most important thing we've been doing from our teams in operations IT is just really making sure we
understand the size and the scope of what the private client groups and the teams at Signature are used to on the
system side. So, our main focus is to ensure that we avoid any potential customer negativity, minimize any
customer impact. So, we're going through that process now.
You know that process will not – will not impact the actual date of the Flagstar integration, but it is something
we're working towards now to finalize a date on and just to ensure that we get the systems converted in the most
efficient and effective way possible while minimizing customer impact.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
That's right.

Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Chris.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, good morning. I want to go to the guidance slide, if you could, for a moment. The expense guide, the $1.3
billion to $1.4 billion, which is pre-Signature, I understand there's a ton of moving in this parts and it's still early.
But can you help us just on the expense contribution from Signature?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So I'll leave, and I'm going to pass the baton back to John on the expense side. Obviously, it's early days. If you
look back what they were running, they were running around $800 million, mid-$800 million run rate on the
previous year. Remember, we didn't take all the businesses, and there are a lot of transactional benefits we have
as we restructure the transaction. So we're running at $1.3 to $1.4 and we reiterated that guide on a standalone
basis. But as we put on the Signature teams – and a lot of it – now, obviously the actual private client groups,
they're going to remain intact. So that's a lot of expense that we are forecasting within our run rate.
But if you start with the mid-800s and then get a similar transaction, the nature of the transaction like this, since
it's not a traditional M&A deal and [indiscernible] 00:19:00 receivership transaction, we tend to believe there's
much more savings given the type of transaction.
So historically, we've always been between 35% to 50% range. You probably will get the higher end of the range
given the nature of the transaction over time, which then you can probably formulate a run rate as we integrate
these companies. I think that's a reasonable way to look at the combined company. And anything Mr. Pinto wants
to add as the CFO as well what you're thinking here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I think, you know, what Tom said, it makes a lot of sense, and it's what we're working towards right now,
which is we know what our run rate is going to be. We do believe that in the next couple of quarters, our expenses
will be elevated as we continue to go through the process of integration, understanding exactly what we have and
the processes we're going to use to do it, and especially until we get the systems converted. What we do believe,
though, is that we – if you look back, of course, at our track record, we believe we've been very, very consistent in
how we've managed non-interest expense, it's been extremely important to us.
We have a lot of history around effectively managing that in multiple different cycles. And even with the
integrations and acquisitions that we've had in the past. So, we're really confident in our ability to do that over
time. But we do believe that in the short-term, expenses will be a little bit higher here, as we go through this
process. And then once we get our systems converted, we'll be able to have a run rate that gets into the levels
that Tom just mentioned, right?
So – and the other thing, just to bring up quickly, on our last call, we talked about trying to front run some of the
cost saves from the Flagstar transaction into 2023. That process was ongoing, given, of course, the signature
transaction, that'll take a little bit of a step back. So, that's why you'll see just a little bit more expenses in the
9

quarter than we anticipated. And then from a run rate perspective, we believe we'll be able to manage to a really
solid run rate combined, once we get through our systems integration.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Reginald E. Davis A
Senior Executive Vice President & President of Banking, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So, Chris, I would also add, just be mindful, in the first quarter, at the beginning of the year, we did a
substantial mortgage banking repositioning for the franchise to position ourselves regardless of interest rates on
the mortgage space. And lease – on the lease, it's execution, that was put in place, I think it was late-January into
February-ish.
So, we don't have the full benefit of that going forward. So, we feel over each quarter, as we put on Signature,
and as we get to the benefits of the full mortgage repositioning, you'll see ongoing favorable adjustments, as we
walk – as we work through the integration phase of towards the end of the year with Signature. Clearly, we'll see
each quarter more steps made towards putting the franchises together.
Maybe Lee Smith, you want to talk a little bit about, on the mortgage side, what we've accomplished with that.
Lee?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Matthew Smith A
Senior Executive Vice President & President-Mortgage, Flagstar Bank, FSB
Yeah. No, thanks, Tom! So, yeah, I think we mentioned on the last call that we executed on a big restructuring on
the mortgage business. We let 700 FTEs go as we right-size the distributed retail business so that we're just an
in-branch footprint model. But when I say in-branch footprint that is a combination of both the Flagstar and New
York Community Bank branches so, it's a bigger geography.
And we did it because we want to be profitable on the origination side, even in this tough mortgage market. But
we're still one of the biggest bank originators of mortgages originating in all six channels. We hold a considerable
MSR asset, which generates strong returns. We've got the servicing and subservicing business that closed off a
lot of fee income. We're the second largest warehouse lender. We do MSR lending, servicing advanced lending.
And we're working on more aggressive deposit gathering from the mortgage ecosystem.
So, whether you – we do B2B, B2C on the mortgage side. Whether you're the biggest bond in the industry or
whether you're an individual borrower, you can come to Flagstar, we'll take care of you. We look at it as the one-
stop shop, and we're able to generate stronger earnings through the whole food chain of the – of the mortgage
ecosystem.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Thank you for all of that. My follow-up, just want to make sure I understand, John. So, if I'm starting 8 –
mid-8s for legacy expenses for Signature, and you said 50%, so that would get you low 400s kind of a destination.
And then, we would add – and on top of that add the CDI that you've previously talked about. Is that – is that the
message we should be taking away?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
No, I think that's maybe a little bit aggressive. It's the high end of the range Tom gave. I think it's probably a little
bit lower than that. But, you know, that's a – that's a decent way to start to look at it.

benefits there on the tech side as well. So we're really looking at putting all these systems together. And as we
remember when we announced the conversion date, you should get significant benefits on a standalone basis
pre-Signature on Flagstar, you know, post the conversion date as well. So when you come up with your estimated
run rate, I think that those are all fair assessments when we're coming up with what you think the expense run
rate.

Mark Fitzgibbon Q

Just to follow-up on your earlier questions. I think, Tom, that Signature had something like 134 teams. Do you
have a sense for how many have stayed? How many have stayed today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So, Mark, great point. So we didn't acquire the entire institution. There were other teams that didn't come
with the transaction. So we estimate it's about one 126, 127-ish. I think we're like 125 now. So, I call that a huge
success. I think Eric has worked hard alongside with me to make sure that we have the retention plans in place,
and we're super excited about where we are there.
So, we think about the teams that we were focusing on. It's about 125 out of 127-ish and we feel really good
about that. And the retention process has been very strong. And, more importantly, the culture of getting this
company together with a much larger balance sheet, being able to do a lot more for the client is only enhanced.
So, we're excited about that, Mark. And I would say it's a huge success for us and it's never-ending, right? You
have to make sure that as we work on culture, the team understands that we do have other products, other
opportunities for the new customers from Signature coming on board to really enhance the customer experience.
So, Eric and I had spent a lot of time on retention, and we believe it's been a success.

Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
And then, secondly, unrelated, what does the pipeline of new business in banking as a service space look like
today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, look, I think, in general, we are developing a lot of technology initiatives, really trying to strategy focused on
going out there and being within the middle of the pack. And we have some good work to do over time, and we
see some good developments there.
Just on an aside, if you look at what Signature has done historically on technology developments with the client,
it's also been very innovative. So, collectively, I think our opportunity is even more innovative now with the talent
skills over at Signature, combined with our initiatives here on what we're doing in banking as a service.
There's just some good wins along the way. We have – the government business is obviously a focus of ours, and
it's been consistent and we're looking forward to partner with our technology partners there. And it's been a very
successful process for us. And we're looking at all opportunities that make sense for the bank going forward to tie
into the customer needs. So, I'd say it's been relatively strong.
We had the – some runoffs that we expected during the turmoil in March. But the dollar amount, I think, we see
mortgage as a service and government as a service and banking as a service of what 7.5, John?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
A little lower.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So it's still relatively strong number. And we're looking forward to hopefully new developments with the US
Treasury relationship as that gets on boarded. We're doing a lot around the digital side. That's all in automation
analysis trying to get that up and running where we go for what plastic to digital and that's the plan to work with
the government on that. So we're excited about development. But, you know, it's a long churning market, and I
think the pick above the Signature team is going to help that journey.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Last question I had for you is I wondered if you could share with us your thoughts on capital or whether you have
a target there and also the dividend.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, obviously, you know, what capital builds is going to be significant as to tangible item. In my prepared
remarks, I made it very clear that, you know, we're talking about capital formation going forward, which is a very
good place to be.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2023
And, you know, this transaction is highly accretive both on the upfront tangible as well as the earnings per share
going forward. And our dividend coverage ratio just on for pro forma and analysis, the ratio comes down
substantially. So we're very pleased about where we end up on a projected basis where these [indiscernible]
28:50 our dividend coverage ratio dramatically improving on a dividend side. So obviously, the dividend is strong,
and we're very comfortable. And going forward into these multiple transactions, it becomes even more, in our
opinion, much stronger.
That being said, on capital, we think that we're in a very good position to generate a lot of capital as we go into the
quarters ahead. And that's kind of in my prepared remarks focusing on the tangible book value creation so, John,
if you want to add?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
And the other thing that we started looking at too is when you look at our common equity Tier 1, you know, we're
in the – you know, we increased it a little bit in the quarter. So it came in a little better than we anticipated. We've
run it that, you know, a 9% or under we're slightly under CET1 in the past. We're comfortable with those levels,
but those levels are going to start coming up. And the other thing to keep in mind, Mark, too, is when you look at
the unrealized loss on our securities portfolio, and if you looked in a peer group analysis, including unrealized
losses on securities, we – we're at the – closer to the top of the list in CET1, and then the bottom of the list.
So, there's a couple of different ways that we do look at capital. You know our history from a loss perspective. So,
we believe we can run that at these levels. We're cognizant of the facts though, of where we are, from a peer
perspective. And that's why this transaction, we look so forward to, because of the capital generation it provides.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Matthew Smith A
Senior Executive Vice President & President-Mortgage, Flagstar Bank, FSB
Yeah. Mark, just one major point here when we put the transaction together, working behind the scenes and
getting this deal done with a regulatory constituents, we were very clear that we wanted to solve for capital, where
there was no negative impact on capital, as a result of the transaction. And then the accretion benefit is
substantial. And that's how we, kind of, solve for and how we formulated our bidding process, to be able to be
successful to acquire the selected assets and liabilities – and assume the liabilities that we focused on. That was
key in our capital we view, as far as coming in, to figure out how we can put this transaction together. So, we're
very excited about the capital build formation post transaction.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2023
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, everyone. Hey. I just wanted to put a finer point on the expenses. Again, I know it's tough,
but you said the mid-800s, I think Signature at the end of the year was running closer to, like, a $930 million, kind
of, run rate, and I know you didn't bring over everything. So, I just wanted to clarify, is it starting from a mid-800s
level, John? And then working its way down to 35% to 50% cost savings from there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, I mean the 862 we mentioned was just the year, right? The annual 2022 expense so we just used that kind
of as a kick off point for the piece. But that's right, we didn't take, you know, all of the businesses. So, you know,
we think the number from that perspective is just probably under a $2 billion run rate on a combined basis.
So I think that's the easiest way to look at it. We think that's pretty conservative and hopefully we'll be able to do a
little bit better than that over time. But we think that's really where this is going to shake out when you look at
putting both companies together, you know, for the go-forward period when we get the systems converted.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Thank you for that. And I did want to follow up on just the legacy deposit base. You know, could you give
us a sense, I know there's a lot of moving parts between all the programs and then the seasonality from the
custodial deposits and whatnot. But I guess, you know, when you look at the legacy deposit base, do you have
any thoughts on, you know, what the seasonality will look like throughout the year? And, you know, I guess what
your growth targets are for deposits for the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Let me, I'll just start that and then, you know, I can turn it over a little bit to Reggie on the retail side. But
one item to keep in mind is the government as a service business, you know, those deposits which, you know,
we've talked about on multiple calls which worked out for us because they're non-interest bearing, but they – that
runoff does continue on those deposits. It is done, you know, slightly better than we originally anticipated. But, you
know, that runoff continues so that that we'll see a runoff in that non-interest bearing segment throughout the next
couple of quarters. That totals $1.3 billion as of March 31st, so we'll see some runoff there.
We really, a lot of the banking as a service type stuff that we expected to runoff when the liquidity event happened
when the liquidity event happened has run off. So there are probably a handful of smaller items in that perspective
where we'll see some slight runoff. But there's nothing really – besides the government deposits, there's nothing
really that we see from a materiality perspective that we expect to run down here.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2023
Well, new program that were hoping new programs are coming from California by the end of the year, maybe
even the end of the third quarter. So we're hoping that starts to kick in. But I was just looking at the runoff piece,
which we don't think it'll be that material when we're looking at banking-as-a-service or the mortgage-as-a-service
pieces.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. I did have one – just one more question if Reggie doesn't have any input there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Reginald E. Davis A
Senior Executive Vice President & President of Banking, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
No. The only thing I would – yeah. The only thing I would say, and I don't want to be redundant, but we have
pegged in plan for deposits to be essentially flat to slightly down. And at this point in time, we would not change
that. When I say slightly down, we're talking $300 million to $500 million on that base of $28 billion or so. So,
again, we think we can kind of hold deposits. We've been successful even through the first quarter, and so there's
no reason to think differently.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Thank you. And then I did have one more question just on the office side. I appreciate you putting that in
there. I wanted to ask if you happen to know of the 55% that's in Manhattan, you know, where that's kind of
geographically in Manhattan. Like, you know, what percent is midtown, you know, versus the other
neighborhoods?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Reginald E. Davis A
Senior Executive Vice President & President of Banking, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
We'll follow back on that. But I think the messaging is that, you know, we know our customers very well. We're
very comfortable with the LTV, the debt service coverage ratio. And we could, you know, follow-up and get more
granular there. But clearly, a lot of that business is generated from the long-standing relationships we had with our
customers. And a lot of that transactional growth has been driven off at 1031 exchanges.
So, if you have a significant asset gain that's been in a family business for so many decades and value is created,
multi-family versus TRE, they kind of move around depending on market conditions. That's been a history of our
focus on this type of asset class, but not in the business of doing office building financed in very rare
circumstances. So, this is a culmination of many, many years of relationship lending that tied out to the holistic
position within the – within the strong relationship of the legacy NYCB.
And again, we have – we have no delinquencies, we have no charge-offs in the space. If you look historically –
and going back some decades, I think the overall loss content in CRE is probably lower than multi-family may be
[indiscernible] (00:36:16) John, 10 basis points or...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Slightly lower than multifamily.

Reginald E. Davis A

So yeah, we feel really confident in it. But right now, we're seeing very strong performance, no delinquencies, no
late pay. And we're working with our customers in the event there are some issues on just changes in square foot
rent rolls. However, the LTVs are a very low and the relationships are very strong, and we know the customer
very well.
And I think John can then follow-up with more granularity. We don't have it in front of us right now, but we can get
back to you as far as what streets they are on. If it's – I'd say it's more [indiscernible] (00:36:45) we don't do C
lending, period. And I think we're probably more driven towards the – more towards the B to B plus-ish. But, you
know, we stay away from the C-type situations.

Good morning.

Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Hi. Good morning. So, I know there's a lots of puts and takes to 2023, like you've outlined, obviously, the
uncertainty in the markets.
But the purchase and the function agreement for Signature has provided a lot of liquidity and presented bigger
growth opportunities like you've outlined.
I'm just wondering the initial targets from the Flagstar deal, including the [ph] 1, 2 (00:37:35) ROA, 16% ROCE,
the 15% efficiency ratio, would these be considered a bit conservative given the benefits of the Signature deal?
Like, are these targets, when you hit a more steady like run rate, what will you be thinking here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, I'm going to take it from a very high level and I'll pass the baton to John again because these financial
questions are on forward-looking guidance. We don't have a lot of forward-looking guidance. We gave some
short-dated forward-looking guidance. But we're very pleased on culturally putting the size of the transaction
together. It's been a very good experience with the team. Senior team is doing a great job on focusing on getting
the culture right and, more importantly, our integration plans are on target.
With that being said, the mortgage business has been up and down, and it's a volatile business. So, we were very
proactive right out of the – right post our closing to right-size that. And that was the first step to ensure that we
continue profitability and all interest rate environments.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2023
Where we stand today, our institution is in a very different place when it comes to liquidity, when it comes to asset
sensitivity versus liability sensitivity. I can't remember ever being in the seat where we can talk about asset
sensitivity. So, it's a pretty good place to be and having tremendous optionality about the business and where
we're going to deploy that excess liquidity.
But I think I indicated previously that by sitting on cash right now and making those decisions, we're making a 3%
spread based on the transaction on Signature stand-alone, which is pretty attractive when our margin was, I think,
closer to 60%.
So, as we've deployed the cash, as you look at the – round out of the commercial banking space you have a lot of
verticals. You have some great, great opportunity to really round out the verticals, build out the commercial bank,
and clearly focus on team build, focusing on integrating the Signature culture into the new Flagstar culture and it's
going to be able, you know, keeping the teams focused and bringing those deposits back.
I mean I just, don't underestimate the opportunity in front of us here that when there was a run in the system, you
know, these accounts were not closed. They were just moved out while our goal is to get a lot of that money back
and be creative with our clients, especially on the Signature side, to really be their white glove service. That's the
secret sauce of Signature. So that's an exciting opportunity for this institution.
And then we can take the growth in the future, we're looking at our brick-and-mortar locations in phenomenal
parts of the country where we can take Eric and Eric's team to start ramping up growth and continue doing what
he's done very well for the past 20 years, which is build value. So it's an exciting time and I think when you think
about overall returns, this bank is not a traditional thrift model anymore. It's moving towards a commercial banking
model. And I feel very strongly that we've accelerated that with the Signature transaction and the Flagstar
transaction by to 10 years. So that's a good place to be and that's just my opening tally so maybe, John, if you
want to...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I think remember too, when we announced that the Flagstar transaction that was all the way back in April and,
yeah, that was a totally different interest rate environment. So just keep that in mind.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A

But we're pleased within the ecosystem. I really think there's a great opportunity on the mortgage ecosystem. As
Lee Smith alluded to we are going to go after deposit opportunities in all parts of our business and I think it's an
uncharted opportunity here. But with the TPO channel, with the relationships with the warehouse business, we

want to have our share of compensating balances. We have some great, great team members here that are going

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And then just to follow up, you did provide some guide to expenses regarding Signature, which is helpful. I'm just
wondering, you know, from your talks and discussions with FDIC, you know, I think there are a couple of things
with the transition service agreement.
I believe that, you know, those the resulting conversation is what – how you kind of like guide it, I believe. I'm not
sure there's anything you can share on that specifically. I'm not sure if that's still being hammered out and like
what you kind of eluded to is that some of the costs could be elevated in the next couple of quarters. I'm just
wondering if anything you can share there. And then, obviously, if discussions on the – servicing the remaining
loans have been discussed and you can share anything there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Matthew Smith A
Senior Executive Vice President & President-Mortgage, Flagstar Bank, FSB
So, yeah, that process is ongoing. We're still just a little over a month from the transaction. So, that process is still
ongoing. So, we're working through exactly what loans, what deposit, what processes, other assets, other
liabilities that we're taking going through the whole pro forma analysis. So, yes, that is one of the reasons why in
the short term we'll be slightly higher than the run rate we talked about earlier.
From a servicing perspective, we continue to service the loans for the FDIC, and we'll be reimbursed for our cost
for the servicing of those loans. And then, once something happens and those loans are disposed of by the
receiver, there's always an opportunity to see what happens and who that buyer is, to see if there's a longer-term
potential benefit to continue servicing those loans depending on what the buyer wants.
So, yeah, no, that process is ongoing. As you can imagine, it takes a little while to kind of finalize that as we go
through. But, yes, we're working towards all of that as we're speaking.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, I would just add one comment on that whole process in respect to the real estate side of things. We have –
it's an in-market transaction. This is – was our number one competitor in the multi-series space. So, they're in
New York. We're in New York, and we have great consolidation opportunities to really take advantage of the
opportunity to bring people together in the appropriate real estate setting.
So, we're excited about our team diving into that deeply. We don't have a lot of time to make those decisions in
conjunction with the contract that we signed with the FDIC what we think is great opportunity here for efficiency.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
So I want to start on – given the strong retention of the Signature teams, I'm surprised you have been able to
draw back some of the deposits they lost. I'd imagine the teams are fairly well intended to do that. I know it's still
early, but what are you hearing from their customers right now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, well, it's a great question. And we were – you know, we went into this with the expectation of a much
significant outflow because who knew what's going to happen on Monday. But what's most important is that the
team is excited. The team has the incentive plan to bring the money back to the bank and as well as different
solutions, right?
I think in general, there's an industry where there's a reluctance to be well above uninsured, right? So we have to
plan for that and be there for our clients and be creative. And I think the creativity under Eric's leadership with his
team is going to go after the opportunity.
And I think the way we structured it with the legacy Signature model that they have, you know, strong incentive
comp plans to be recognized based on our success on deposit gathering. That's the model, right, Steven. So it's
early days, right? And when I mean the quarter win yet because it's who knows what happens on Monday this
week. So you just got to be very cognizant that I don't think that the marketplace is still out of the woods with
respect to this volatility. But there's no question that it's stable, which is great.
I'll reiterate my point on DDA. It's a rock. It hasn't moved. That's a phenomenal statistic that our operating DDA
accounts have actually was slightly up in the month of April compared to the closing of the transaction, which is a
testament to the need for the payroll accounts, the operating accounts tied to the businesses.
But the push here is to go back and, you know, convince the customers that, you know, banking is overall is in a
safe perspective and it was an idiosyncratic situation that happened in early March. And ultimately, the system is
strong and highly regulated. And we have to convince them. That's our job to go out there and hand-hold the
customers to get back the confidence in the system. And that's what we're doing.
And I'm very proud of my team because it's been ongoing. And even during in the depths of that crisis, we were
talking to many of our clients and look, we're a regional bank and we handle our customers, it's important. It's all
about service on a standalone basis NYCB folks that do a great job. And now, we put on Flagstar and now
opening our Signature. It's all about service, service. And I'm going to reiterate again, culture, culture, culture.

And we have a tremendous opportunity in front of you to really make sure it's client first and get them comfortable
that, you know, with the stamp of approval of doing a transaction this magnitude in the depths of a dark situation
in banking, I think it goes a long way when you talk to clients about the safety and soundness of our institution.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Let me – let me follow-up on that, Tom. So, you basically doubled the size of the company in a few
quarters. And if we learn anything, particularly from SVB, it's that they grew so quickly that they probably outgrew
their capabilities in risk management. I'm sure your risk management is fine, or else the regulators would not have
given you the stamp of approval you just talked about.
But you also just said in response to the prior question that you accelerated the transformation of the company by
10 years with these two deals. So, talk about the risk management infrastructure that you have today. How much
do you have to now invest in it, people, systems, et cetera? And how should we think about the cost of that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, I would say to you, Steven, this goes back to legacy [indiscernible] (00:46:59) right. We went to a journey at
49.9. If I recall, when I was CFO, it was about five years at the time, holding the line at 49.9 and not crossing over
an average. So that until we really built a position to understand what was expected as our regulatory framework
was uniquely different than some others, which gave us a lot of oversight at the time to be with [indiscernible]
(00:47:21). And obviously those rules and pronouncements have changed but we've held through that our
position that we were going to have a bank that could be ready to be $100 billion. That goes back to when we
started that journey back in 2012 or 2011, and it's been a constant reinvestment over time.
So we're really excited about where we are. There's always going to be updates, it's always going to be evolving,
especially given the regulatory landscape that we're in currently, because who knows what's going to come out of
this, I will call a mini crisis of confidence. But I don't think it's going to get easier but, you know, we're prepared to
do what we have to do to manage a safe and sound organization. And risk management is our number one focus,
right?
So we have a tremendous team and I'm proud of my risk team and I do a great job. And we're going to add a lot
of new people from all three organizations together, as well as from the outside, and be ready for what's required
for us as a highly regulated institution. But this is nothing new to us. It's just something we've been working on for
quite some time, and we're prepared to make sure we have the highest standard. And John, if you want to add a
little bit more comments on this?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. And I think, you know, what Tom mentioned just to add, when you look at some of the capital stress testing
and liquidity stress testing frameworks that we built within that timeframe, we'll serve us extremely well here as we
integrate both Flagstar and Signature onto those models from a stress testing perspective. You know, our teams
built those with the expectation of the $100 billion threshold that we're at now. So, you know, there's always –
there will always be some incremental add, but we don't think it'll be a material ad given the structure in the
backbone that we already have in place.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2023
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah and I think in general, you're looking at operating leverage now, right? This is something we've been geared
up, and we assume the Flagstar transaction release, we were ready to be at that $100 trillion mark and getting
ready, but we were there, as far as operationally, moving from that direction.
And at the same time, we get the offering leverage, we're making very substantial investments going back to early
days, and we just continue to evolve from that. So, obviously, it's the most important aspect of this company going
forward, is handling risk, given the nature of the bank and our new products. But we're clearly excited and I'd say
10 years, it's really more the transformation from thrift to a commercial bank. That's a milestone of the vision, to
take a traditional thrift mentality and bring it to the commercial banking platform.
And having these great team members that come from all over the country, with tremendous banking experience
in commercial operations, and dealing with the high touch white glove service, that's the transition. So, I think
that's what is acceleration and having different verticals, having different products. We've completely changed the
dynamic of who we are going forward as the new Flagstar.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. That's helpful. And just one final, and maybe for John so, you said you expect margin expansion through
the rest of this year. One, what rate assumptions, like, which rate backdrop are you assuming? And two, which is
even more important, given the new balance sheet mix, what's better for your margin for the Fed to start cutting
rates in the second half, or if the Fed goes up and then holds for the rest of the year? Like, which of those
backdrops is better for this balance sheet? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So, in a very short period of time, we've gone from, on a stand-alone NYCB sensitive to pretty significantly
liability sensitive, to layering in the Flagstar transaction, which got us to slightly moderately liability sensitive, and
now laying on signature, where we're moderately asset sensitive. So, we have an asset sensitive balance sheet
right now that has an awful lot of flexibility in it, given the cash that we have on the balance sheet. So, there's a lot
of flexibility, a lot of easy ways to, kind of – to move that asset sensitivity around in the short-term.
But to answer your question, yeah, we would benefit from a Fed raise right now. And when we look at – when
we're with the modeling, to get to the next quarter or so is increase, a couple of items there that I mentioned. We
are expecting one more rate hike here in the Bloomberg forecast next week, and then pretty flat for the end of the
year. There might be one at the end. I think there's one cut that we forecasted in at the end of the year.
But when you look at what's coming due, especially in the second quarter, that's going to help pick up a little bit to
the margin. That's one of the main drivers as well, as well as what Tom has mentioned, which is just the
noninterest-bearing percentage and the stability that we've seen so far in those deposits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
And so, Steven, big picture for us is that we're in a very unique position given the fact that we have a balance
sheet that is very versatile. We have tremendous optionality given it's sitting in cash. And as I indicated

previously, that, let's say, will yield 5% in the cash temporarily, and we picked up the liabilities at around 2%. So,
the spread on that is about 3%. It's still above our margin.
So, as we – if we have to shift, we have a position of cash to make that a smooth transition to rebalance
ourselves depending on what policy is going to be driving the Fed. So, we're in a very interesting spot in respect
to balance sheet.

I just wanted to go back to the Signature deposits, down less than expected 9% versus expectations for 2020.
From here, how much more runoff, if any, do you expect and over what timeframe?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Just – well, just from a street modeling perspective, we haven't changed our modeling when we're looking – when
we're looking at forecasting to the original 20%. We're cautiously optimistic that we won't see, you know,
anywhere near that that run off, and hopefully potentially could see some growth once this really and continues to
stabilize. But right now from a forecast perspective, we haven't changed our initial modeling of the 20% runoff.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2023
Okay. And then, for the quarter, what was accretive yield prepayment penalty income? And then looking forward
with Signature, what are your expectations for [ph] accretable (00:53:39) yield through the end of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, prepayment penalty income for the year was, I think, $1.6 million. So, you know, really, really small number
on the – on the prepayment side. On the accretable yield perspective with Signature, we're looking at – our best
estimate now is picking up about $100 million a year. That's what we're looking at. If you look at the mark that we
booked, it's about a four- or five-year average maturity. We are still, of course, finalizing that process as we go
through all of our purchase accounting items. But we think it's going to be around that $100 million range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And that's the – that's the added accretion. What was it for the quarter? And maybe just – because it was a partial
quarter with Signature, a full quarter for Flagstar, give me some idea of...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Really – yeah, very, very small amount for Signature. I think the number was in the $5 million range, $4
million to $5 million range. I'll get you the Flagstar accretion number. I don't have that in front of me.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Could you comment a little bit on – and understanding that business today is much more diversified than it
has been historically, but gives us some sense for new loan yields today and what the roll-on versus roll-off
dynamics are?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So Matt, it was interesting what's happening for us, given the market conditions in commercial real estate and
multifamily, our spreads are 300 basis point spread off of the five-year treasury with a minimum of 6.5% percent
coupon. So you're not seeing much fixed rate product being done at all in general.
But we've introduced this over the past year, which I think is a very interesting opportunity for our customers if
their choice is having synthetic opportunities to think about structuring a transaction as to fix the float and we get
the opportunity to put a floating rate instrument which is thought we've never done before.
So with that being said, I think we put on about just when re-pricing, about $2 billion of our multi-family businesses
now tied to [indiscernible] (00:55:41) plus 250, which came off about 3.5% and now it's yielding about 7.5% as
they figure out what they're going to do maybe next year if rates were to go lower and we'll make decisions upon
the financing that in the future. But that's been a very positive balance sheet contributor to having a more versatile
asset sensitive balance sheet. So it's tied to floating rates.
Many customers now are contemplating on putting on a swap and doing a floating rate structure with us. And then
at the same time, we were also introducing our capital markets business, which has a sizable benefit to sell them
protection on that and be able to structure the transaction where we generate our fee income. So that's part of our
model going forward.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2023
Now we want – we haven't a model that in, but that's what we're seeing in the business and most of the other
products are all floating rates. So, you know, to add significant spreads. So that's going to be the ongoing benefit
of versatility within the asset classes. But it is a change in the market when it comes to multi-family story because
of just the tightening of credit. There's no question that credit has tightened when it comes to the offering. And I
think most banks are around that level within 270 quarter spread of the five-year treasury as an offering.
And I think many customers are just kind of waiting and see what to do and you don't see a lot of actual
transaction when a transaction does take place. I think the financing cost is very different than it was a year ago,
which I think will be an advantage to the bank, as long as they can handle the debt service coverage ratios, right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Right. And actually that brings to my next question, just as all eyes are on office CRE these days. Rent regulated
multifamily has had its challenges on the top line, given the Red Guidelines Board. As you've seen, those types of
loans reset today, coming out of 2018 vintages. How have debt service coverage ratios reacted to higher rates.
And have you had to do anything with those borrowers, like, lower rates or extend amortization periods, just to
keep them going and keep them operating the properties.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. And given that we're a low leveraged lender, LTV is a traditionally lower, we underwrite very differently than
some of our competitors. We haven't had to have those conversations as of today. What we are seeing is that
when they're in an option period, they're choosing a [indiscernible] (00:57:50) option, versus the home loan bank
spread option, which is too punitive. And in very rare circumstances, you're seeing refinance activities. So, we're
getting the benefit of pricing a 3.5 coupon at the 750 in the car marketplace.
Now, it's a lot cheaper for them last year, but rates are elevated, but we're still seeing 100% consistency on no
delinquencies, no lay pays, and customers are thinking about probably next year, though, they'll take this option
and come back to the bank if rates are lower. So, they're making a, I guess, a decision in the future to come back
to the bank when they feel it's necessary. But it's been very, very consistent on a monthly basis.
Again, the growth on the multifamily side has been very slow, it's going to be, I'd say, relatively flat. But what's
interesting about our portfolio, I'm not sure exactly, but maybe John has it, probably – it's probably $4 billion, $5
billion coming due on that same roll period on credit to have to refinance, or I actually have the option. And right
now, we're seeing about 75% of those customers take the option, which is a nice pickup for our margin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Good Morning. Good Morning.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of points of clarification from me you noted you will continue to use the excess
cash to pay down borrowings. Does the pace of that accelerate beyond the second quarter? Or are you doing a
majority of what you intend to do in the second quarter itself?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, we're going to continue to look at the market conditions that we're in. But, right now, we expect to pay down
borrowings as they're coming due. We just have most of our borrowings coming due in the second quarter. We
got a little piece coming due in the third and the fourth as well. So, the plan is to pay down borrowings throughout
the year depending, of course, on our liquidity position and other items, loan growth.
One item, you know, just to keep in mind with our securities portfolio being so low and the securities asset
percentage, we'll hold a little bit more cash on the balance sheet just as a placeholder for that piece as well. But,
yeah, the current plan is to continue to pay down borrowings. We'll look to pay down some of our wholesale
deposits like broker deposits as we mentioned earlier as they come due, depending on market conditions and
where cost is on deposits like that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
And just to add the point there, when I took over as CEO, I made it very clear, our challenge and our strategy is to
be less dependent on financing to wholesale liabilities to run this business, to transition from a thrift to a
commercial bank.
And going back to the acceleration of the business for 10 years, this is a lot of liabilities that are not subject to
wholesale liabilities by traditional commercial banking and going back to the BDA growth to 27% of total deposits.
That is, in my opinion, an acceleration of where we have to be as a successful business. And we're super proud
that we're able to have a better funding mix to generate better returns over time.
So, this is going to be very powerful towards the story as we continue to hone-in on commercial accounts and the
BDA side of things, as well as relationship banking.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
So, is it fair to say that despite the high asset sensitivity from the deals, if the Fed does start to cut rates gradually
next year, you should still see some sort of benefit to NIM from cutting costs to funding?

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2023
So, let's say this. We're in a very interesting position given that my whole career at NYCB, we've been liability
centered. So, we're excited about our balance sheet positioning. And we think we have versatility and optionality
to make the decision when that does take place.
But if you're in – if you look at forward side fund futures and the one and done they hold for a while, if they raise it
being [indiscernible] (01:01:47) they will make more money and then we'll adjust accordingly. But having the
versatility of cash makes that a little easier to make decisions on that versus having, you know, fixed rate assets
that are locked-in long term. We have sitting on lots of cash right now to make those determination as we
redeploy into assets that are more commercial bank like in traditional [ph] flip type assets (01:02:08).
