Q4 2019 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2020
Mariner Kemper
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kay, and thanks to everyone for joining us today as we recap our fourth quarter and full year 2019
performance. As I look back on the last 12 months, I'm proud of our team's ability to produce solid results, which
include strong loan and deposit growth and continued fee income momentum. We earned $66.5 million or $1.35
per share in the fourth quarter and $243.6 million or $4.96 per share for the full year of 2019 on total revenue of
$1.1 billion.
Average loan balances grew 10.6% on a linked-quarter annualized basis. For comparison purposes, publicly
traded banks that have reported to-date have shown a median linked-quarter annualized increase of 4.1% in
average loan balances.
For the total portfolio, fourth quarter top line loan production was a record $1 billion. Total payoffs and paydowns
were slightly more elevated than usual at $656 million this quarter or 4.9% of loans. Net average loan growth of
$341 million for the quarter was led by C&I and CRE and the recent growth in residential real estate loans
originated, both in private banking and consumer continued in the fourth quarter.
In 2019, we added $111 million of mortgage balances on a year-over-year basis for an increase of 16.4%,
compared to an increase of 13.4% in 2018. We continue to see growth through both, market share gains and in
our underpenetrated markets as line utilization trends have remained fairly steady. The top three loan growth
regions for the fourth quarter were St. Louis, Colorado and Texas. These are the areas with less than 2% market
share for us.
Full-year 2019 production of $3.6 billion represented a 39% increase over 2018 levels and led to $1.2 billion of net
growth on average. We experienced both growth and [ph] pass (00:03:52) as a result of robust M&A activity
amongst our clients, and in several markets have been able to take advantage of disruption caused by bank
mergers. We continue to see opportunity in our markets and the production pipeline remained strong as we look
forward into the first quarter.
Net charge-offs for the fourth quarter were 0.23% of average loans. And on a full-year basis, net charge-offs were
0.27% of average loans, in line with our historic averages. And consistent with our comments last quarter, non-
performing loan balances did indeed decline by 22% from the third quarter. Our loan book remains well
diversified, and I'm proud of our long-term track record of quality underwriting. These results and the quality of our
portfolio drove the lower provision in the fourth quarter.
Now, looking to the income statement, net interest income increased 2.4% compared to the third quarter, driven
by strong asset growth and lower funding costs. As we mentioned last quarter, our strong loan pipeline should
help us continue to grow net interest income even in the current rate environment.
On the fee income side, we saw continued momentum, with an increase of 6.5% compared to the third quarter.
Corporate trust and fund services both posted strong results, and our investment banking teams saw increased
underwriting activity and customer demand, which along with positive fixed income markets, drove solid increases
in agency, municipal and MBS trading revenue.
Again this quarter, there were some noise in our other income line related to market adjustments that often have
expense offsets, including positive impacts from COLI and equity earnings income. Our expenses for the quarter
increased $12.1 million compared to the third quarter, driven largely by incentives tied to business and revenue

growth, hiring in several growth businesses and overall company performance. The momentum in our fee income-
related businesses and the correlation with commission payments can add variability to our expense levels.
We estimate that approximately three-fourths of the quarter-over-quarter increase in expense was tied to
business growth. We continue to invest in our business, including the reinvigoration of our retail business we've
discussed before, rolling out the new teller platform, online banking upgrades and online account opening
capabilities, which are nearing completion.
In the fourth quarter, we launched a retail credit card campaign, which drove some of the increases in advertising
and postage expense. This campaign will build on the growth we've seen over the past year with 2019 retail card
account originations up 63% compared to 2018 levels.
Additionally, we've been opportunistically adding to our teams and to our revenue-producing capabilities. For
example, we've hired an experienced team of middle market commercial bankers in the desirable Twin Cities area
and a successful group of business banking professionals in Salt Lake City. Several of these new hires are on
board now and the rest are in process. We'll share more details on these teams in the coming quarters.
In closing, our success in 2019 has set the bar high for us in 2020. With the current rate backdrop, year-over-year
revenue growth is likely to moderate from the 8.5% levels we experienced in 2019. However, we aren't slowing
our focus and we remain very diligent about controlling expenses as tightly as we can without mortgaging our
future.
As I shared earlier, we will continue to invest prudently in our business to enhance our revenue-generating
capabilities and improve customer acquisition trends and experience, but will also have an eye on efficiency.
While we typically do not give guidance, I believe we can do better than the current 2020 consensus earnings
estimate, barring any material, unexpected deterioration in the operating environment.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Ram for a more detailed discussion of our results. Ram?

Thanks, Mariner. The benefits from our strong loan and securities growth balance and lower funding costs that
drove the increase in net interest income were partially offset by declining asset yields and the payoff of some
higher-yielding balances that shifted the mix of our loan portfolio.
Total earning asset yields fell 23 basis points to 3.76% from the linked-quarter, driven largely by a 30-basis point
decline in loan yields. Approximately 61% of our loans are variable, tied to short-term interest rates. One month
LIBOR fell 26 basis points in the fourth quarter, impacting 56% of our loans that re-priced during that period.
Interest-bearing deposit costs declined 22 basis points, contributing to the 24-basis point reduction in the cost of
interest-bearing liabilities and the 18-basis point decline in total cost of funds. Net interest margin for the quarter
was 3.02%, down 7 basis points from the prior quarter. While our net interest spread at 2.66% was virtually
unchanged from the prior quarter, the benefit from free funds declined by 7 basis points, sequentially, as their
value declined in a lower interest rate environment.
Overall, margin was positively impacted by approximately 16 basis points from lower funding costs and balance
sheet mix changes and 4 basis points from higher loan fees. Negative offsets included approximately 17 basis

points related to loan pricing, 7 basis points from the decreased benefit of free funds and 3 basis points from
excess liquidity, primarily driven by excess deposit flows in our institutional businesses.
Re-pricing in the AFS book provided about 1 basis point of net interest margin improvement as cash flow rolling
off at 2.43% during the quarter was reinvested at 2.69%.
Considering recent market dynamics and our expectation that the Fed will hold rates for now, we would expect
approximately 4 basis points to 5 basis points of net interest margin compression for the first quarter.
As always, the actual outcome for net interest margin will depend on a variety of factors such as the pace at
which LIBOR moves, loan growth, the potential variability in our aviation, trust, and public fund businesses and
our overall balance sheet mix and needs for funding.
Average total deposits increased 5.6% on a linked-quarter basis, largely in institutional and commercial money
market balances along with the beginning of annual buildup of public funds. DDA balances rose by 5.2% to $6.4
billion, driven largely by corporate trust, including our aviation business and the typical year-end buildup of cash
for municipal payments. Our overall deposit composition by source is shown on slide 14.
Moving back to the income statement, Mariner discussed some of the opportunities we're seeing in fee income
and the detail on specific drivers are shown on slides 21 and 22. Total reported noninterest income was $110.4
million for the quarter, an increase of $6.7 million compared to the third quarter.
Positives include trust and securities processing income, which improved $1.6 million or 3.6% over the third
quarter, driven largely by funds services and corporate trust revenue. Additionally, trading and investment banking
income increased by $1 million, due to higher trading volumes. Also included in the increase were some market
and volume-related items reported on the other line. $2.6 million of COLI income or a $3 million increase from the
third quarter, which has the proportional offset in deferred compensation expense, a $2.5 million increase in
equity earnings on alternative investments, which is one contributor to the bonus and commission expense and a
$1.4 million linked-quarter increase in derivative income. $2.3 million of lower gains on sale of securities partially
offset these increases.
Noninterest expense for the fourth quarter was $203.5 million, an increase of $12.1 million from the third quarter.
More than 50% of the quarter-over-quarter increase in expenses were driven by higher bonus and commissions'
expense within the salaries line item tied to business and revenue growth and overall company performance.
Deferred compensation expense, the offset for the increased COLI income, increased $2.5 million on a linked-
quarter basis. More detail on quarterly expenses can be found on slide 25.
Our effective tax rate was 13.9% for the fourth quarter and 14.8% for the full year 2019, benefiting from greater
levels of income from tax-exempt sources such as municipal bonds. For 2020, we expect our tax rate to be
between 15% and 16%.
Finally, going back to slide 17 in the asset quality section, we provided some high-level preliminary detail about
the implementation of CECL. We expect the day one impact on our reserves will be an increase of approximately
10%, with very minimal impact on our common equity Tier 1 ratio at adoption.
These estimates were calculated using current economic outlook on the current characteristics of our portfolio.
We plan to review – make any necessary modeling updates and present our final Day 1 impact when we file our

10-K. Day 2 provisioning will depend on the mix of portfolio growth as well as expectations for the macroeconomic
variables highlighted on this slide.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and I'll now turn it back over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the
call.

Mariner or Ram, just wanted to start on the – in the investments you're making. How should we be thinking about
the level of expense growth in 2020 versus 2019 in light of this and in light of kind of the more challenging
revenue outlook that we've been presented by lower rates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Well, we don't obviously give guidance on that. But what I would say is that the – and we talk about some of the
level of business investment expense related to revenue and investing in teams and things like that and some of
the marketing dollars that hit the fourth quarter quarters, making them look little higher than they had been. Some
of the answers to that will be dependent on what the revenue picture looks like in 2020. And we certainly expect –
we talked about it in our comments as we always do that the loan growth and pipeline numbers looks pretty good
as we look in to the first quarter. And we are, as we mentioned in the comments, investing in a couple teams in
Salt Lake and in Minneapolis.
So those things will kind of weigh, right, on the expenses. I don't know, Ram, you want to add anything? You don't
give any guidance on that. You shouldn't expect a big reduction in our expense [indiscernible] (00:16:15), so I
don't know what else to say. Ram, do you have anything...

Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Chris, we'll definitely be cautious on expenses. Obviously, internally, we focus a lot on operating leverage. So to
your point, the operating – and Mariner's comments, the revenue environment, the rate environment will be a
tough one going into 2020. And as Mariner said, we set the bar pretty high for us in 2019, but that doesn't mean
we will not focus on the expense side of the equation.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
We've definitely focused on making sure that we operate as efficiently as we can in 2020 without mortgaging the
bright future that we see by continuing to invest in our company. I've never been as pumped as I am about
investments we've made and the team that we have as I look into the next three and five years.
I mean, 2020 is going to be tough operating environment, but the investments we made and the team I've got on
the field. If we could go to the Super Bowl like our Chiefs are going to the Super Bowl, I would say we have a
Super Bowl contention team.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
That's good color and thanks for that. I'm just trying to get a sense of where you are in the investments, right, the
two teams. How much of the impact was felt in 2019 versus a continuation of what you see as some revenue
opportunities to invest?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. I'm sorry, Chris, I don't know if we can give you too much more color on that without becoming a company
that gives guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. That's fine.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
In terms of the quarter, there was a comment in the release about a derivatives offset. Could you just – I'm just
trying to make sure that's kind of – it seems like a one-time item, but just could you give some color on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. Sure. Chris, this is Ram. So, just to give you some context for the full year 2019, our total derivative
expenses were less than $200,000. So, what you saw in this particular quarter was an adjustment or a benefit of
$3.5 million that reduced our expenses. It, basically, what it did was reversed out all the higher derivative

expenses in the second and third quarters we've been talking about. So, if you go to our press releases in second
and third, our derivative expense spiked because of some activity.
So, our notional book on the back-to-back swaps has increased about 50% in 2019. So, as part of that, we
revisited our valuation adjustments or valuation assumptions and made it more in line with where the industry is,
so that's why you see that quarter-over-quarter spike of $5.1 million swing, but I would look at the total expense
line item on a full year basis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
That's great. Thanks. And then last one on the seasonality in the deposits. How do we think about – I mean, it
seems like this quarter's seasonality was even more meaningful than prior fourth quarters. How do we think about
kind of first quarter – first, second quarter of just the balance sheet as it accordions up and down? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
As I said in the prepared remarks, some of the seasonality is typical with public funds. Those come in the second
half of December really, so there wasn't a big impact in the fourth quarter, because of public funds, necessarily. A
lot of the deposit inflows and the excess liquidity had to do with our institutional businesses, particularly Asset
Servicing, because funds weren't readily deploying some of the cash balances into the market, and then the
aviation trust business, which is fairly new to us and so there's a little bit of volatility to it.
Public funds typically peaks in the first quarter and then starts to head down. So it's really hard to say what's
going to happen to some of these deposit balances given their very nature. They tend to be very transient in
nature, short term. They get deployed pretty easily in the markets. So, a lot of things can change on us, which is
why it's really hard to give a clear answer on what will happen to deposits and margins for that matter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I would add, though, the aviation trust business, it is new to us, so we don't have a lot of experience with it. But,
as the business continues to expand – one second here [indiscernible] (00:20:06) something's going by on the
road here. Snow blower – snow truck just went by. Anyway, our expectations for the aviation trust business are
that, as it expands and we have more business coming along, that the growth in that deposit base stays behind
should grow, because a number of clients is growing. So, there is an expectation that that deposit base continues
to grow even though we don't have a lot of history with it.

Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Going back to the last question on deposit growth expectations, just perhaps more broadly just thinking about
2020 in aggregate, deposits exceeded loan growth in 2019. So just curious, just given kind of where you're pricing
and given some of the expansion in the corporate trust side of things, if you still expect deposit growth to exceed
loan growth in 2020.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Rine A
President & Chief Executive Officer-UMB Bank, N.A., UMB Financial Corp.
No – this is Jim, Nate. We don't anticipate that. However, on the increased expenses that you saw in fourth
quarter, the increased marketing expense for the consumer division was to continue to attract consumer deposits.
The increase in the consumer card spend that we're currently doing that we've seen success is to continue to
build our consumer franchise. So we are looking to balance some of that growth in our consumer division.
We have been able to successfully attract, obviously, commercial deposits via yield. But, with the new markets
that we're going into, those teams are laser-focused on deposit collection as well, not just loan building balances.
So, we do anticipate those to be successful [ph] obtaining (00:22:04) balances in Salt Lake as well as
Minneapolis. But to exceed our loan balance expectations, I don't anticipate that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. That's helpful color. Appreciate it, Jim. And then just changing gears and thinking about the Institutional
segment, the pre-tax margin ticked up nicely in the quarter and I think it's the highest level that we've seen last
seven or eight quarters or so. So just curious, just given some of the investments that you've made in a number of
those units and just given the scale that you guys are seeing there, if we can kind of see this as a sustainable pre-
tax margin level going forward, or if you think there's more investments there maybe going to limit that expansion
[ph] or this (00:22:41) level going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Rine A
President & Chief Executive Officer-UMB Bank, N.A., UMB Financial Corp.
I would think we could anticipate this level going forward. We continue to make investments. As you know, we
closed on the last corporate trust acquisition while smaller in revenue, we have made considerable investments.
We've discussed what we're doing with the various fintech partnerships that we established as far as the FDI
sweep (sic) [FDIC sweep] relationships. But the corporate trust business as well as the traditional broker-dealer

business, but we've seen increases in the bond trading month-after-month, quarter-after-quarter, which has been
reflected in the year-end results. And we're very excited with what we're seeing with Institutional. I think I'm
confident you'll see continued results from that division.

I wanted to follow-up on the discussion around the bonus and commissions. Do you have what that – how much

volumes?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
So, we didn't break it out exactly for you. We'll – probably going to stick with the answer we gave in our prepared
remarks, which is that three-fourths of the expense increase came from business generation activities of which
included in bonus and – well, yeah, so you have the bonus and commissions tied to new business, we had some
marketing dollars related to the increased activities for our credit card and deposit gathering activities. There's
some expenses related to the hiring, the regional hirings of the folks that we've added in Minneapolis and Salt
Lake, and Ram, you might have a couple of [ph] additional thoughts. (00:24:51)

Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. Gordon, if you go to page 25 of our slide deck we kind of enumerate, where the drivers of the salaries and
benefits are. So, I'd go back to what Mariner said about 70% of the quarter-over-quarter increase was because of
volume and revenue growth, and then my comments also 50% of the expense growth is related to bonus and
commissions again. So, of the $10.7 million increase in salary and benies $6.8 million was tied to bonus and
commissions. Again, overall company performance, widget growth, revenue growth all of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gordon McGuire Q

Yeah. I guess I was just trying to get at, given the really strong balance sheet growth, the strong fee growth and

Well, I mean, it was a hell of a good quarter, I guess. Love to repeat it. I mean, again, we don't give guidance on
that, but it was a pretty damn good quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gordon McGuire Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. And then just switching to fees, specifically cards, purchased volumes were up double digits this year, but
interchange fees kind of low-single-digit growth. Can you talk about the headwinds you're seeing on interchange
rates and whether you see that continuing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. Well, I'll- just high level. And then, Jim, who reports them can go deeper. But as we talked in the past, 60-
some-odd percent of our interchange income comes from the Healthcare business, and we've talked about that
business in the sense that we don't necessarily control what we get paid there, because we are partners and we
have sharing arrangements. So, that pulls down what would be the numbers otherwise. So, we carry better
interchange in the Commercial and in the consumer, but the volume you see in our slide deck on page...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
37...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
...37, you can kind of see the breakdown of the percentages and that's really what pulls it down. I don't know if
you want to add anything to it, but it's the sharing relationships with our Healthcare business pulls it down. Now
the beauty, if it's working right, is it should be volume-driven, right? So all those partners and all those
relationships. So, from just an earnings growth perspective, it's a lower margin, but decent growth. So, $3.2 billion
in the quarter of interchange spend, right? So, we expect that number to continue to grow on a quarterly basis.

James Rine A
President & Chief Executive Officer-UMB Bank, N.A., UMB Financial Corp.
In that model, it's obviously tied together with the deposit growth, coupled with the account fees. So, the cards is a
piece of it, but certainly the lower margin, which Mariner just described.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gordon McGuire Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. That's helpful. And then, Mariner, just any updates on M&A prospects, where the focus would be and just
readiness for any kind of M&A given the internal investments this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Sure. So, I mean, as far as readiness goes, all of the things we talked about, the investments we've made, et
cetera, were ready. We're – very much would like to – no new comments really from quarter-to-quarter as far as
where we are with it. We've got an active effort, active team, active calling effort, very much would like to do a
deal that we can see all the right things from whether it's synergies or cultural overlap to ultimately spread our
expenses over a larger organization within our footprint or contiguous. So, we're ready to go and would – have an
active effort and continue to look for the right deal on the banking side.
And then, again, no new real comments. We continue to look for corporate trust opportunities, aviation trust stuff,
anything related to our corporate trust and trust activities. And we had our investment services business, where
we're providing banking services to broker dealers and fintech companies. And we're looking across that whole
spectrum for either product additions, where we can add more products [ph] on the truck (00:29:10) to the
customer or bolt-on-type acquisitions or consolidation opportunities. We believe that on the corporate trust side,
we can continue to be consolidator there as we've been successful with that and are already having a lot of
success. We continue to see opportunities there and we'd like to continue to see opportunities there.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2020
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Good morning, Ebrahim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities
So most of my questions have been asked and answered. A couple of just follow-ups and sorry if I missed this.
The $2.2 billion in period-end deposit growth. Now, I understand there's some seasonal outflows we should
expect in the first quarter, but any sense of how much of that you expect to retain beyond 1Q of the $2.2 billion or
$3 billion?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
It's really tough to say. Ebrahim, this is Ram. It's really tough to say with some of these businesses. There's the
traditional seasonality that we've talked about historically about public funds. But, as I said earlier and Mariner
added to it, some of these businesses were fairly new, especially the corporate trust, the aviation business and
that's growing really nicely on a steady basis. And then there's volatility, especially at the end of the quarter
sometimes. So, it's really hard to say a long answer [indiscernible] (00:30:35) it's really hard to say what the
outflow is going to look like.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
And we've talked about the success really across the board on fee income, which is coupled in a lot of ways with
deposit growth. So fund services is having success. And with every account we bring on our fund services, there's
a bit of institutional deposit business that comes with each and every one of those relationships. So, hard to tell at
this point. Certainly, there'll be some...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Contraction.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
...some contraction just because of the public funds business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
I talked about a 3-basis point impact to margin from excess liquidity. And if you look at on a quarter-over-quarter
basis, we're probably about $500 million to $600 million richer in liquidity. So, that's probably a guide for you to
consider in answering your question, too.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities
And what was the public fund at the end of the year in balances?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2020
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah, I don't have that handy, Ebrahim. The second half of December is that when it starts peaking up, so first
quarter is the seasonal peak for it. I can get that to you later.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities
All right. I'll circle back. And just I guess separately, I think you've been – so you had a very strong quarter on loan
growth, you've been steadfast I think [ph] too (00:31:50) back half of last year even when things were macro-wise
not looking great in terms of high-single-digit loan growth expectations. Just talk to us in terms of anything in the
markets that seems concerning and what are the markets where you're seeing the best growth and industry
verticals where you're seeing the best opportunities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President &
Chief Executive Officer,
UMB Financial Corp.
It's really coming from everywhere. My remarks have been the same for quite some time about why we continue
to see sort of better than industry loan growth, which is a lot of it is, I'll hit them high level again, but
underpenetration in a lot of our large markets. So just being able to execute the right people on the ground, plenty
opportunity for us to just get a decent market share and several large markets.
And we continue to be underpenetrated vertically also, right, as it relates to stronger efforts over time to put
specific specialty individuals and marketing and all that, and hiring against particular verticals and market into
them specifically more than we were – we used to be generalists. So, those two things, which we've talked about
for some time continue to drive a lot of opportunity for us and we think there's a long runway for that.
We were also just – have a really good team. There's a lot of tenure, putting people, and particularly in the
commercial lending side, as I think a lot of you know, when you're able to put the same people in front of your
prospects and clients for a long period of time, it bodes well for you. And it's a long sales cycle in this business,
so, we're uninterrupted from the crisis, so, we don't have to retrain our prospects and customers. And, again,
that's kind of the same remarks I've had about that for quite some time. I don't know, Jim, if you want to add...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Rine A
President & Chief Executive Officer-UMB Bank, N.A., UMB Financial Corp.
No – we saw loan growth in every market but one, and it was more of a rural market for us. Industry-wise, there
hasn't been – I mean there are pockets, but we are seeing some slowdown in transportation. I believe I mentioned
that last quarter as well. Nothing in our portfolio that we're concerned with, but just macro indicators that raise
concerns, but our production last quarter, almost 50% was from C&I.
So with that C&I business, we get the treasury business and the ancillary accounts. And so, it's been exactly what
we – with the addition of the real estate, which is over the last five to six years on the CRE book, but it's what we
have always done, and our market penetration, as Mariner addressed earlier, the markets that have historically
been underpenetrated. But we have a compelling story and we're continuing to tell it in the markets that we've
expanded into over the years. We've had great growth in Texas and Colorado, St. Louis, and it continues to move
forward onto Salt Lake and Minneapolis.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 29-Jan-2020
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities
Understood. Thanks for taking my questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: The next question is from David Long with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Good morning, David.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Ram, I think you indicated for the first quarter, what you were looking at, said that the NIM may be down 4 to 5
basis points. And just curious if you could provide a little color on how you see asset yields and the funding side of
the balance sheet, both working in the first quarter to get to that point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, if you just look at one-month LIBOR, right, since year-end, it's come down about 15 basis points. It's
right now at 165 basis points. So, as I said in my prepared comments, about 40% of our book is tied to one-month
LIBOR. So assuming that the Fed doesn't do a whole lot just because of the movement in LIBOR, you should see
some pressure on the asset yields or, I should say, loan yields. But that should be offset by the growth prospects
that both Jim and Mariner talked about.
And then on the portfolio side, if you look at our disclosures, we have about $1.1 billion of roll-offs or cash flows
coming due in the next 12 months, and approximately a quarter of them were in the first quarter, and the roll-
on/roll-off difference is about positive 30, 35 basis points. So, that should offset some of that asset yield pressure
just from what's happening with the LIBOR rate.
And then, on the funding side, we're being very diligent on the funding side. Obviously, we'll be very cautious and
react to the environment. And so, we should see some alleviation of pressure on deposit cost and, overall if the
interest rate stays the way it is, same thing on net interest margin as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Got it. Thank you. And then, as it relates to the Commerce Trust acquisition, I believe that closed at the end
of November. Did that contribute to any of the deposit growth that you had in the quarter?

No.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Not materially, no.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And then lastly...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
That's a small acquisition.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Right. Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A

Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
And lastly as it relates to CECL, as you guys are getting closer to actually having to report results under CECL,
have you thought – or does it change your appetite for any particular type of loan? Does it change how you –
either your willingness to make that loan or the pricing that you have historically done versus what you may do in
the future?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Not really, because I think whatever we would do is going to come on the margin, then it's going to come in over
time. As you've probably learned, there's different asset classes that carry different weighting and the mortgage
business, for example, is one of those. And, currently for us, that's not a big part of our balance sheet, so it
doesn't have a big impact. We do plan on and we've talked about that expanding our mortgage business, but it
should happen over time and have an impact that you would imagine would come with something that happens
measured and over time. So, not really, no, nothing we expect to change the way we do business.
Actually, the way we bring in business today and the type of the business we bring in today is actually more
beneficial to us than a lot of our peers as it relates to CECL.

Dave, it all comes down to competition, right? So what the big banks do, if they react to CECL, which is unlikely,
then we'll have to change our terms to it, but otherwise it's strictly on a street fight.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is a follow-up from Chris McGratty with KBW. Please go
ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thanks [ph] for your thoughts. (00:38:50) Just two quick ones. First, any thoughts or any updated thoughts
on the buyback? You obviously haven't been using it, because of the organic growth, but any kind of change in
philosophy on levels of where you might consider buying the stock?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
No. And for those who haven't heard it before, I mean, we obviously want to put our capital to work to build the
business first. So, we're going to prioritize our capital against acquisition, lift-outs, and things like that. And then,
to the extent that those aren't coming as quickly as we like, we can obviously always do buybacks and/or increase
our dividend and do some more acquisitions. So, it can be a mix of all of it. We keep an eye on it. You've seen us
do it before. So, we have a willingness, did our first ASR not long ago. So, certainly, willing to do it when the time
is right and it's appropriately priced and we feel good about it. But other than that, we're going to be focused on
putting our capital to work building the business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. And, Mariner, on the M&A front, I think your last deal with Marquette, it was $1.5 billion in assets. Can you
remind us the range of what you might be considering. Obviously, 2019 and 2020, seems to be the market
moving towards more transactional and transformational deals, but maybe your appetite for size.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
There is no hard and fast rule there. The smaller the deal, you're doing all the same amount of work to do that and
you don't get the list out of it. Certainly, the Marquette deal would be a nice bottom end of the range. And the
bigger – so and then the only other thing that I would say, because we have – we take risk very seriously, the
bigger the opportunity, the less risk we're going to want to take doing the deal. So those are going to have to be
banks look a lot like us if they're bigger if that makes sense. But, we're prepared to do deals, Marquette or larger.
