Senior Vice President-Investor Relations, Bank of America Corp.
Good morning. Thank you, Katherine. Thanks for joining the call to review our first quarter results. By now, I hope
everyone's had a chance to review the earnings release documents which are available on the Investor Relations
section of the bankofamerica.com website.
For the many years, I have been in IR, I have always joined the other speakers in the same room as we
presented earnings, but this quarter, we like all of you are practicing following safe physical distancing protocols,
and we're joining this morning from different locations. So first I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan,
for some opening remarks, and then I'll ask Paul Donofrio, our CFO, to cover the quarter briefly before turning
back to Brian to moderate a question session. So hopefully this will make the session go a little bit smoother.
Before I turn the call over to Brian, let me remind you, we may make forward-looking statements during this call.
For further information on forward-looking comments, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our
website, or our SEC filings.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2020
Over to you, Brian?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Thank you, Lee, and good morning to all of you and thank you for joining us to review our results. It has been an
eventful quarter, but I hope all of you are safe and your families are well during this war on the COVID virus.
As you think about our quarter, our decade-plus long discipline of responsible growth, has resulted in us
strengthening our balance sheet and making investments in technology and people and talent over the decade
has helped us prepare for this environment. Today we're going to do three things with you.
First, I'm going to provide a couple high-level thoughts on the quarter. Second, I'm going to make sure you know
how we're supporting our teammates, our customers, our communities, and delivering for you, our shareholders
during this crisis, and third, Paul, will cover the results in more detail.
I'll start this discussion by covering the chart on slide 2, along with the comments on slide 3, which go with the
chart. Given the volatility in the last couple months and the global slowdown, I'm proud of Bank of America and
our teams' results. I want to thank my 209,000 teammates across our company, for all of their efforts this quarter,
both in the front-line roles and support functions. It's been a company-wide effort to continue to serve our
customers well during these times.
As I said many times, we're in a war against the COVID-19, and at Bank of America we're doing our part to help
fight the effects of that war. We do that by living our purpose, we're helping people manage their financial lives
through this crisis. My teammates know they're playing a critical role for their clients, whether the people, whether
companies of all different sizes and institutional investors. Their role is to help keep the economy moving as best
we can during this healthcare crisis.
We have seen major disruption in the financial markets that effected every line-of-business as customers move to
stay at home status through voluntary, or involuntary measures. In the United States and around the world,
governments are responding with historic measures in a very short period of time. Central banks, governments
and others have responded to provide tremendous liquidity to keep the markets functioning and to protect
individuals and businesses at a historic scale.
The banking industry continues to play a vital role. We're well-capitalized with strong liquidity, and we have helped
transmit the benefits of these programs as well as our own measures in the economy and markets.
So let's cover our first quarter performance. In the first quarter 2020, Bank of America produced $4 billion of after-
tax earnings. This included building our loan loss reserve by $3.6 billion over charge-offs, and that's due to the
economic deterioration of the global economy as a result of the virus. Earnings per share were $0.40. Earnings
were down $3.3 billion from last year. This was led by the reserve build. I think it's useful to draw your attention to
the pre-tax pre-provision income line as we believe it helps illustrate the underlying earnings power of the
company to support the credit costs that are inevitable in a downturn.
We produced $9.3 billion of pre-tax, pre-provision income in the first quarter of 2020. That was down 5% from the
first quarter of 2019. That is relatively strong given the changes in interest rates that have occurred, the widening
of credit spreads, and other changes across the past 12 months, particularly in the last quarter or so.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2020
During this period, we maintained our strong balance sheets. Global Markets clients' needs for liquidity,
temporarily increased our balance sheet during the quarter by as much as $130 billion from year end, but through
the efforts of Tom Montag and team, we ended the quarter marginally up.
Small business originations, not from any of the special programs, were $2.4 billion during this quarter, showing
support for that segment of the economy. We also met our larger commercial borrowing customers' demands with
commercial loans increasing $67 billion as clients drew down against their unfunded commitments and new
commitments were made.
In addition to these fundings which reduced commitments, we also had requests for new commitments.
Remember, some of the commitments that we're making are for clients like grocers, health care companies, and
others who need liquidity because of the rising demand for their services during this time.
At the same time, we returned $7.9 billion in capital to our shareholders, and as you know, during the quarter, we
voluntarily chose to suspend the buyback portion of those distributions to shore capital for expected customer
growth. We did all that in our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.8%, still finished 130 basis points above our 9.5%
minimum.
From our liquidity standpoint, we ended the period with $700 billion in liquidity, increasing $120 billion from year
end. Driving that increase was deposits increasing $149 billion, far exceeding our $67 billion expansion in our
loan portfolio.
Moving away from the balance sheet and on to earnings, a couple highlights I'd point out. NII finished a bit better
than expected at $12.3 billion on an FTE basis, flat with fourth quarter. Capital Markets revenue was strong. Sales
and trading revenues, excluding DVA, were up 22% year-over-year, and investment banking fees were up 10%
year-over-year. We had a record quarter in Fab Gallo's equities trading business.
Our non-interest expense was a touch better than expected as well at $13.5 billion. Net charge-offs remained low
a little more than $1 billion, up $163 million from last quarter, driven by an uptick in commercial. Obviously,
returns to the quarter were lower given the reserve build. Return on tangible common equity was 8.3%.
Let's turn to slide 4. Just as important as our financial results this quarter is what we're doing to take care of our
teammates and to help clients and communities impacted by the virus. We do this not only because it's right thing
to do, but also in the end it will benefit you, the shareholder.
Many of our teammates are on the front lines of this effort, including daily engagement with the clients, whether
it's in our financial centers, which remain open, financial advisors guiding their clients through the turbulent times,
or the capital and liquidity we're providing to companies across the businesses.
To be able to do all these great things, to support clients, our first priority since the crisis, was to address the
health and safety of our teammates. We've taken that teammate-centric view of our efforts because it's the right
thing to do and we need these teammates to do a great job for the clients. We've taken extensive measures in our
business continuity work to prevent teammate exposure to the virus. We've established multiple locations for
important work of our trading operations, and call center platforms, and otherwise enabled social distancing by
moving more than 150,000 people to work from home. That means ensuring that they have appropriate tools and
resources and we have the appropriate control protocols for them to do their day-to-day work.

To give you a sense of scale, we have deployed about 90,000 laptops in the last 60 days across the company.
We've moved quickly to assure social distancing in our facilities that are still open, installed additional protective
barriers in all our branches, thinned outstanding operations environments, and posted health care professionals in
our facilities to help anybody.
We're also taking measure to help our employees better handle the stresses in their personal lives. You can see
some highlight here. One example has been our increased child care support. We allow teammates to hire
relatives and others so they can work given school and daycare outages. Our life events services team provides
teammates with personalized support, resources, tools and access to benefits, and we're providing special
compensation to teammates in the financial centers, operations centers and call centers. We also hired 2,000
teammates in March to continue to increase the staffing we need, especially in the consumer-related areas, to
handle our clients' needs, and we announced that there would be no layoffs during 2020 of our teammates.
Our previous announced $20 an hour minimum compensation is now in effect and reflected in the numbers you're
seeing across the company, and we confirmed our commitment to bring on our 3,000 young kids for summer jobs
and starting their first job whether graduating from college or graduate school.
Taking care of the employees is the right thing to do and enables each to play the important role they must
provide as critical providers of services to help the economy keep rolling through the virus. We're doing that in
many ways. In addition to keeping our financial center open and the many things I mentioned earlier, we're doing
more for our clients through these times. Customers who are struggling to make their payments are calling the
bank with deferral requests on loans and waiver of fees. As in other disruptive events that we've done for
hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, and other things over time, we work with them.
Since this humanitarian crisis began, we received more than 1 million requests for assistance through early April.
We've seen the volume of the deferrals, however, reduce since the peak a week or two ago, and we'll see where
it goes next.
We've provided a chart on the material beginning on slide 5 about the deferrals. As you can see, in our case, the
largest number of requests has come from cardholders, but as a percentage of loans, we have the most requests
from our small business clients. These clients are at the heart of the governmental programs and are also at the
heart of businesses that were shut down due to the stay-at-home orders by governments.
One of the things that's different about this business for us is it lends to doctors, dentists and others. They have
deferred payments until they can reopen their practices. We're a leading lender to them, and you'll see those
recover as they go back to business.
Our mortgage requests remain relatively low in volume, and some of our customers, for all our customers we've
also suspended foreclosures or repossessions of autos which may have been pending.
Our affluent clients are also looking for our company in these turbulent times. We've been there for clients with
both upgraded systems and capabilities to allow them to trade, a centralized investment office, supplementing
20,000 advisors' capabilities to talk to the clients and give advice and counsel. Client engagement during the
quarter was up two-thirds from last year even as if our advisors work from home.
For small business clients, we built the first digital platform for the PPP program, and we launched it 12 days ago.
The team is working hard to drive over 300,000 requests for funding through the process, so that we can get
those loans funded. As stated earlier, our regular way of small business support was over $2 billion in the quarter.

For larger clients we provided $67 billion in access or unfunded commitments. Imagine the speed and capacity
that our team did to absorb the requests so quickly and get them funded over the course of the quarter.
These commitments are a much-needed liquidity bridge for many clients especially in light of the rapid changes
that occurred in March in the commercial paper markets and in debt markets. As those markets opened up, we
also saw strong debt capital markets issuances to support clients. In fact, March ended up being the busiest
month ever for US high-grade market with approximately $260 billion of total issuances. The previous record was
$171 billion, and we led the market. April has continued this busy pace, and has been good to see that access is
expanding to high yield clients.
For our institutional trading clients, we have provided an operationally sound system with improving speeds of
trading. In a single day, we had $1.7 trillion in payment value made. Again, the investments made over the past
years to our trading platforms delivered more speed and capacity to make that possible, and all doing while
maintaining good controls.
The clients we serve in that business had witnessed severe volatility in markets, and we're able to provide them
with liquidity when they need it. Since the month end spike, you can see the Tom – since the mid-month spike,
Tom and the team managed the balance sheet into the place we need to be at the end of the quarter.
Lastly, to assure communities around the US where we live and work got some assistance before the government
money came to help, we announced $100 million donation to help fight the virus outcomes and supplied vital
support across those communities. Our market presence and other leaders are playing a vital role in this critical
action. We've also increased our capital to Community Development Financial Institutions by $250 million on top
of our industry-leading $1.5 billion commitment to these institutions.
As we've discussed each quarter and frequently over the last decade, we've transformed our company, so we
could serve clients consistently across all areas. We've added a slide in the appendix to remind you how much
the company has improved this balance sheet position and risk profile since the last crisis.
[ph] We've done some (00:14:21) stress testing to illustrate our preparedness, but we're now being tested in the
new environment. We didn't know what economic challenges might cause us to have to demonstrate this
resilience, and that challenge is upon us now. I remain very proud of what my teammates have accomplished
across every dimension, to help us be ready and empower the part they're playing to help the world win this war
against this virus.
An area that we focused on also is consumer spending. We've seen a shift in consumer payments, and this is on
slide, beginning on slide 6. Overall, a couple months ago in a healthy US economy, payments were running at a
high-single digit, in fact, in some cases, a low double-digit percentage increase over the same period prior of 2020
January and February versus 2019 January and February. And in fact, that would have shown that the economy
this quarter probably was going to grow faster than people expected.
That changed with the virus spread, and you can see that impact here on slide 6. We saw a severe immediate
decline in discretionary payments for travel, leisure, and other things that you've read about and entertainment
that you expected. This was followed immediately by large increases in payments for necessities around
groceries and staples like health supplies, et cetera.
Then as large cities and states began to move to voluntary and mandated stay-at-home status orders, we saw
large declines in debit and credit card spending into other categories. At the same time, we've also noted a

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2020
stabilizing going on in the level of payments in other areas like ACH, cash wires and P2P payments. The broader
measure is the black line in the chart. As you can see, overall payments have declined but remained at high-
single digit pace year-over-year moving down from double-digit pace to around 8%.
The total movement in the US has been pulled down by a significant decline in the card spending, which is more
than [ph] up which has been affected (00:16:11) by the travel, entertainment, and other related areas and retail
areas, and that's gone from 7% to 8% to only 2% increases in the month of March, and it has fallen to negative
territory in April.
The overall spending, however, of all types of spending in our customers seems to have stabilized in the last few
weeks. During mid-April, we're seeing spending run at about a low $50 billion average level compared to $60
billion average level before the crisis. That's per-week spending. We'll see how that plays out through this quarter,
and that stability may provide insight to the level of economy activity in the shutdown status.
Our digital banking capabilities have helped with both customers, service and sales. While our financial center
visits are down and sales are down because of that, we're seeing consumer digital log-ins remain steady as
people manage their financial lives on a digital basis.
Digital sales are down, but they're now running about 50% of the total sales. Our loan production for cars,
mortgage, and other products has fallen week-by-week. For the first two weeks of April comparing that to the
February average levels, we're seeing them down 55% for card origination, 40% for mortgage, and 60% for autos.
Again, we're watching to see these stabilize at some level of activity even given the shutdown economy, and we'll
keep watching that as states, cities, and the federal government focuses on reopening the economy.
On slide 7, you can see the couple charts showing the commercial loan draw velocity and deposits in March. In
total, we saw $67 billion increase in commercial loans due to draws from the commercial clients in the month of
March. 45% of these fundings came from large commercial clients. 40% were from large corporate bank
customers, and the remainder was spread across all the businesses. As to the asset quality of what we funded,
92% of these were collateralized or were made to investment-grade clients, and less than $100 million were made
to clients whose loans became non-performing. The draws were well-diversified by industry and were largely
driven by US borrowers.
From a capital standpoint, we're already risk-weighting these commitments at 50% under standardized capital, so
the additional impact to CET1 from these draws was roughly 25 basis points for the quarter. The draw activity was
pretty normal through the first week of March but ramped up in the second week before peaking in the third week
of the month. The requests have come down in every one of the last three weeks, and as we've seen, we turned
April, draw requests and new credit requests have mitigated at these levels. We're seeing clients' attentions turn
from securing liquidity to more structured view of their capital position and their needs to better understand how
they will prosper and fare in the COVID-19 impacted business model.
We observed earlier that the commercial paper market froze in the middle of the quarter as new rounds of virus
worsened, clients were unable to access the CP markets. As the Fed announced the programs, we saw that
market stabilize, and over time here, we've seen it lengthen out, so draws can be for long periods of time.
It's worth noting since we have one of the premier global treasury services platforms in the world, we saw many of
those draws come back in our balance sheets as deposits. [ph] While the (00:19:25) 75% of the loan draws were
not used for other pay-downs, ended up as deposits with our company. In addition to that, at the bottom of the
slide, you can see the growth in deposits by every line of business. Global Banking deposits rose $94 billion,

which is unusual for sure. We also saw $32 billion increase in consumer deposits, with 65% of that being
checking. That has been our normal. In fact, it's the 28th quarter of the last 29 that we've had year-over-year
growth at $20 billion or more in Consumer Banking deposits.
Wealth Management deposits reflect a flight to cash in the first quarter but have been stabilizing last year, as you
can see in the charts Paul will show you later.
So with that, let me turn it over to Paul.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. I'm beginning on slide 8 with the balance sheet. Overall, compared to
the end of Q4, the balance sheet expanded $186 billion driven by an increase in deposits of $149 billion. Deposit
growth in excess of our loan growth was invested primarily in cash or cash equivalents.
As Brian mentioned, the team did an incredible job of not only providing our Global Markets clients the needed
liquidity from a mid-March spike, but also reducing those levels by the end of the quarter.
Shareholders' equity of $265 billion was stable with year-end but included some offsetting factors. AOCI
increased $6.5 billion, reflecting several factors but was driven by a $4.8 billion improvement in the valuation of
AFS debt securities. Offsetting this increase to equity were two items. Share repurchases and common dividends
of $7.9 billion exceeded our $4 billion of earnings given the reserve build this quarter. And as a reminder, we
booked a reduction in equity on January 1 by adopting CECL.
Now, with respect to CECL, we elected the five-year transition option made available under the Fed rule to delay
any capital effects of CECL until 2022. The January 1 reserve build plus Q1's $3.6 billion build equate to a total
increase in the reserve of $6.9 billion since year-end. Assuming no regulatory relief, including the original relief
planned for day one adoption, our CET1 ratio would be 22 basis points lower than we reported. The relief
received in late March accounted for 12 of the 22 basis points.
As you know, a portion of the CET1 impact of future reserve increases or decreases during the emergency period
will also be delayed until 2022. Beginning in Q1 of 2022, we will begin phasing in the 22 basis point reduction for
these impacts in equal quarterly amounts through 2025.
With respect to our CET1, our CET1 standardized ratio declined 40 basis points to 10.8% driven by a $70 billion
increase in RWA. Increases in counterparty risk in Global Markets and increased loan revolvers draws in Global
Banking drove the RWA increase. Lastly, our TLAC ratios remain comfortably above our requirement.
Given the time constraints, in Brian's points earlier on ending deposits, I will skip the discussion on average
deposits on slide 8 and move to slide 9. Earlier, Brian also discussed our loan growth near the end of the quarter
which was driven by revolver draws. Some of that growth affected the growth of average loans presented on slide
10. Q2 should further reflect this late quarter growth.
Year-over-year average growth has been consistently in the mid-single-digit range, and early Q1 trends were
similar to that. Note the significant increases across Consumer and GWIM which was driven by residential
mortgage given continued low interest rates. This quarter, we originated $19 billion in first mortgage loans,
retaining 94% on our books. We continue to see good follow-through on a large pipeline, but [ph] apps are down
(00:24:06) in the past couple of weeks.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2020
I would also note credit card balances. Average credit card loans were down a bit more than the typical
seasonality given the drop-off in consumer spending late in the quarter while customer payment rates continued
at a fairly steady pace. Given the significant drop in card spending, we expect card balances to decline further in
Q2.
Okay. Turning to slide 11 and net interest income, on a GAAP non-FTE basis, NII in Q1 was $12.1 billion, $12.3
billion on an FTE basis and was relatively flat compared to Q4 2019. One less day of interest and lower asset
yields driven by lower rates negatively impacted NII this quarter.
Two primary things offset these negative impacts. First, we saw good loan and deposit growth. Second, lower
rates reduced the costs of our long-term debt and improved our funding costs in Global Markets. The lower rates
also allowed us to price our deposits more efficiently in Wealth Management and Global Banking.
Before I discuss our forward view of NII, I want to emphasize that future NII results will be influenced by interest
rates as well as loan and deposit balances, which will likely be highly influenced by the virus' impact upon the
economy. Both of these drivers have been volatile and may continue to be.
In terms of the forward guidance, as you know, interest rates dropped significantly over the past 90 days. On the
short end, one-month LIBOR, which impacts variable rate loan pricing, as well as longer-term rates which impact
mortgage and mortgage related assets, have both dropped nearly 80 basis points on a spot basis. As you think
about our NII for the rest of the year, I would point you to the asset sensitivity disclosure for our banking book at
12/31 before we experienced these rate declines.
Banking book sensitivity from an instantaneous parallel drop of 100 basis points in rate, at that time, was
estimated to reduce NII by $6.5 billion over the following 12 months. Since these rates moved less than 100 basis
points, the change in NII over the next 12 months is likely to be less than $6.5 billion.
I would also note some additional items to consider that are expected to mitigate some of that decline. First, we
have grown both loans and deposits significantly more than what would have been assumed in that asset
sensitivity at year end. Second, our deposit pricing actions have been pretty swift. And last, the asset sensitivity of
the banking book does not include the benefits to NII of the trading book which is a little liability sensitive. With
that said, we would expect the largest decline in NII over the balance of 2020 to impact Q2 as the bulk of the
repricing of our variable rate loans should happen fairly quickly.
Considering all these factors, particularly the virus' impact on the economy and interest rates, we believe NII could
approach $11 billion in Q2 and then begin to stabilize with loan and deposit growth mitigating the negative
impacts of longer-term asset repricing.
Turning to slide 12 and expenses, at $13.5 billion this quarter, expenses were up 2%. They were 2% higher than
Q1 2019 as increased investments throughout 2019 in people, real estate, and technology initiatives were
partially offset by savings from operational excellence initiatives. Compared to Q4 2019, expense increased
roughly $250 million, reflecting nearly $400 million in seasonally elevated payroll tax expense.
With respect to our outlook, we are still assessing the impacts both positive and negative that the virus has had
on the company's expenses, and as such, are not in a position to provide any updates to our previous expectation
that expense would be in the mid-$53 billion range this year. As a reminder, that mid-$53 billion number was
before considering the dissolution of our BAMS JV and surrounding actions.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2020
With respect to impacts of the pandemic, on the one hand, there are many costs that declined such as travel,
meeting costs, lodging, conferences and lower power costs for unused facilities. Incentives will align with financial
performance and market levels. But on the other hand, as you heard Brian mention earlier, there are costs
associated with protecting, supporting, and rewarding our employees during this health crisis, including
suspending head count reductions related to COVID for the rest of 2020.
We also have costs from the setup, operation, and cleaning of backup facilities for trading and other activities.
This would include the cost of computers and other supplies and expenses to reposition 150,000 associates to
work from home.
Okay. Turning to asset quality on slide 13, our underwriting standards have been responsible and strong for years
now, and we expect this strength to differentiate us as we advance through this health crisis. For years now, we
have been focused on client selection and getting paid appropriately for the risk we take. As you all know, what
really impacts banks in a recession is not the loans put on your books during stress, but rather, the quality of your
portfolio booked during the years leading up to stress.
One independent indicator of the relative quality of our balance sheet is the Federal Reserve's annual CCAR
stress test. Our net charge-off ratio under those stress tests has been lower than peers in six of the last seven
years, and our consistent focus on asset quality has been reflected in our results for many years now. Adjusted
for the recoveries of loan sales in some periods as described before, we have reported net charge-offs between
$900 million and $1 billion for many quarters. Total net charge-offs this quarter were $1.1 billion or 46 basis points
of average loans. Net charge-offs rose $163 million from Q4 driven by commercial losses with the largest
contribution coming from energy exposure.
We saw a small seasonal increase in card losses. Provision expense was $4.8 billion. Our reserve build of $3.6
billion reflects the expected increase in life-of-loan losses given the weaker current and expected economic
conditions as a result of the virus.
On slide 14, we break out the credit quality metrics for both consumer and commercial portfolios. Q1 is too early
to see any significant effects of COVID on net charge-offs. However, there were a couple of leading indicators of
deteriorating asset quality in our commercial portfolio due to the virus as both NPLs and reservable criticized
exposures increased.
On the consumer front, COVID's effect on asset quality were less observable. This is likely due to deferral offers
extended to consumer borrowers. Moving forward, we believe deferrals coupled with government stimulus for
individuals and small businesses should aid in minimizing future losses. Having said that, given the rise in
unemployment claims, we do expect consumer losses to increase later this year and potentially into 2021.
Turning to slide 15, this table provides a full picture of our allowance increase since 12-31-2019, including the 1-1-
2020 implementation of CECL as well as this quarter's build given the worsening economic conditions.
As you can see, our allowance, including reserves for unfunded commitments, was $10.2 billion at year end and
now stands at $17.1 billion. That is nearly a $7 billion increase or 67% since year end. Note that we ended Q1
with an allowance to loan and leases of 1.51%. I would also note the increase in the coverage ratio for credit card
increased to 8.25%, and the coverage ratios for our US commercial and commercial real estate increased to
1.11% and 2.16%, respectively. These ratios reflect our underwriting standards over the past 10 years as well as
our loan mix with the large concentration of secured consumer loans.

We size the increase to our allowance in the quarter by weighting a number of different scenarios, all of which
assumed a recession of various depth and longevity, including an assumption of some tail risk similar to what is in
the severely adverse scenarios.
A weighting of these scenarios produced a recessionary outlook, which includes a marked drop in GDP in Q2,
growth recovered slowly from there, with negative growth rates in GDP extending well into 2021. Obviously, there
are many unknowns, including how government's fiscal and monetary actions will impact the outcome, and how
our own deferral programs will impact losses, but perhaps the biggest unknown is how long. How long economic
activity and conditions will be significantly impacted by the virus.
Okay. Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on slide 16, Consumer Banking
earned $1.8 billion. Results were impacted by COVID-19 through lower rates, higher provision expense, and
modest fee reductions. As you know, banking is considered an essential service, and across the country, we have
kept more than 75% of our financial centers open. In addition, we've added personnel to service calls and
manage digital interactions, not only with respect to existing products and services, but also on small business
applications through the Paycheck Protection Program.
Many of these additional personnel are working from home. While net income declined 45% from Q1 2019, it's
worth noting that pre-tax pre-provision income declined 12%. Revenue decline driven by lower interest rates as
well as the impact of COVID-19. Aside from the higher provision costs, consumer fees also reflected modestly
lower consumer spending and fee waivers beginning late in the quarter.
We continued to invest in the franchise, driving expenses up 3% year-over-year. We added new and renovated
financial centers, salespeople, and increased minimum wages, plus the additional associates added to service
calls I just mentioned. The expense for these investments continued to be mitigated by process improvements,
digitalization and technology improvements. Investments supported continued growth in loans as well as deposits.
As a result, our cost of deposits declined to 150 basis points. Client momentum continued as we saw average
deposits increase $40 billion from Q1 2019. Average loans increased 8%, and we continued to add consumer
investment accounts and saw solid flows into our Merrill Edge platform.
Let's skip slide 18, as I think I covered much of the trends on slide 17 already. The ability of our customers to
connect through digital banking has never been more important. As you can see on slide 18, all aspects of digital
engagements continued to increase, with one-third of sales now processed through digital channels, and as you
heard, that moved higher in the last few weeks of the quarter. We learned a lot from our digital auto and mortgage
experiences, and what we learned enabled us to quickly launch a digital pathway for our small businesses to
apply for loans in the Paycheck Protection Program.
Turning to Global Wealth & Investment Management on slide 19, here again, we saw lower rates and COVID-19-
related credit costs impact and otherwise solid quarter. Note the impact of lower market levels in March. Those
impacts did not impact Q1 AUM fees as March fees were calculated based upon market levels at the end of
February. Merrill Lynch and the Private Bank both continued to grow clients as well as remain a provider of choice
for affluent clients. Net income of $866 million was down 17% from Q1 2019, but here again, pre-tax pre-provision
income was down a more modest 4%.
Revenue grew 2% year-over-year as a strong increase in AUM fees and brokerage fees were partially offset by a
decline in NII, as a result of lower interest rates. Expenses increased from revenue-related incentives as well as
investments we made in the past 12 months in sales professionals, technology, and our brand.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2020
Okay. Let's skip slide 20 and move to Global Banking on slide 21. The early impacts of COVID-19 were more
evident in this segment. First, LIBOR fell rapidly in March impacting loan yields. At the same time, revolver draws
didn't happen until late in the quarter and will likely be more fully reflected in Q2 averages of loans and NII. Lastly,
COVID-related credit costs are higher in this segment as the reserve build was more heavily weighted to
commercial loans. The business earned $136 million, which included adding $1.9 billion to the allowance for
credit losses.
On a pre-tax pre-provision income basis, results declined 21% driven by lower interest rates and by roughly $450
million of net markdowns in the value of loans and underwritten commitments recorded at fair value in our capital
markets books and FPO book. On the positive side, in Q1, we were able to improve our investment banking
revenue and market share. We generated $1.4 billion in investment banking fees this quarter, a 10% increase
year-over-year. In fact, despite a 20% year-over-year decline in the volume of investment banking transactions
across all banks, we processed 9% more transactions in Q1 than the previous year. Growth in investment
banking fees, loans, and deposits reflected not only what we believe to be a flight-to-quality in uncertain times, but
also the addition of hundreds of bankers over the past few years, increasing and improving client coverage.
Turning to slide 22, Brian covered the most important points around loan and deposit growth. I just want to
reiterate one point. We believe companies viewed us as a safe haven in this period of stress. Quarter-over-
quarter on an ending basis, deposits increased $94 billion, while loans increased $58 billion. Not only were we
able to capture as deposits, the bulk of the cash that customers drew on the revolvers that wasn't used to pay
down debt or for other purposes, we were also able to attract billions more in additional deposits even as pricing
deposits lower with falling rates.
Turning to slide 23, as in Consumer and GWIM, our digital capabilities are more important and useful than ever,
enabling clients to work from home and seamlessly manage their treasury needs. And it's no surprise that in this
environment, we continue to see increased use of these capabilities.
Switching to Global Markets on slide 24, as I usually do, I will talk about results excluding DVA. Despite the
volatility experienced in the quarter, Global Markets produced $1.5 billion of earnings in Q1, a 34% increase year-
over-year. Year-over-year revenue was up 15% from both higher sales and trading results and improved
investment banking fees. Expense was up a more modest 2% year-over-year on higher revenue-related costs.
Within revenue, sales and trading improved 22% year-over-year driven by a 39% improvement in equities and a
13% increase in FICC in a significantly more volatile market environment when compared to Q1 last year. FICC
revenue reflected better trading performance across macro products, offsetting weaker performance in credit-
sensitive products resulting from widening credit spreads, which impacted asset prices. Equity revenue of $1.7
billion was a record for the company.
All right. Skipping slide 25 and moving to All Other on slide 26, All Other reported a loss of $492 million. The loss
reflects approximately $500 million for several valuation reductions, including marks on derivative positions and
certain noncore securities, which were impacted by wider spreads toward the end of the quarter. Our effective tax
rate this quarter was 11.5%. It included the impact of a fairly normal level of tax credits from our commitment to
sustainable energy products and other ESG efforts, many of which are taxed advantaged. Applying this fairly
normal level of tax credits against a lower pre-tax earnings base resulted in a lower tax rate. It's just math. For the
full year, I would expect the ETR to be in a range of 14% to 15%.
Okay. With that, I think we'll open it up to questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question today from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
Please go ahead your line open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. Thank you very much for all the detailed insight, in particular your slide that talked about the
percentage of folks who have been asking for deferrals is extremely interesting, as well as the detail on the
reserving analysis. My question has to do with how you thought about that reserving analysis? I know we've been
through stress tests here for 10 years now, and it would just be helpful to understand how you decided to size this
very significant increase in the reserve and how you think it trajects from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Paul, why don't you hit that, please?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, sure. So I mean let me answer the last part first. We've put a reserve on our balance sheet that we think
reflects the information that we had at the end of Q1, and so in terms of what's going to happen in the future, that
reserve is going to go up or down based upon the facts and circumstances and our view of the future when we
get to the end of Q2.
I think when you think about reserves, you've got to really focus on loan mix and the quality of the portfolio, and
then you have the added variable under CECL of everybody coming up with a view of the future. We sized our
reserve build in Q1 by weighting a number of economic scenarios, all of which assumed a recession of various
depth and longevity, and that included assuming some tail risk similar to what's in the severely adverse scenarios.
So, when we weighted the scenarios, that produced clearly a recessionary outlook which included a significant
drop in GDP in the second quarter, with negative GDP growth rates extending well into 2021. We also considered
the impact of various groups of credits and stressed industries. And while small relative to the impact of scenario
weighting, we incrementally factored that analysis into the sizing of our reserve build.
Obviously, there are many unknowns including how government, fiscal and monetary actions will impact the
outcome, but we can try to consider that as well. And we also had to consider how our own deferral programs will
impact losses. But perhaps the biggest unknown is how long economic activities and conditions will be
significantly impacted by the virus.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So, Betsy, I might add a couple things. If you sort of benchmark, this has nothing to do with setting under GAAP,
it's just sort of, okay, now you have it, let's look at it. I think we're about 65% of the last year's Fed supervisory
severely adverse total losses type of numbers. That's one way to think about it.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2020
And then another thing to think about is the construct of the portfolios. Those of you like yourself have been
around our company a lot, I went back and started saying sort of, are we sure how much different we are, and you
– people forget things that it won't mean a lot to people on the phone, the Gold Option program, which was a
restructuring of card debt that went on in the mid-2000s, it started to go into the crisis in 2008 timeframes at $25
billion. Eight quarters later, six quarters later, something like that's down to $12 billion. Half of that was charge-off.
There's none of that around now.
And so, it's not only the FICO scores and all of the things that you have, it's also that there's pieces of the portfolio
costs us a lot in the last crisis aren't there. And that's just how we positioned the portfolio. So even some of the
industries which people – we are focused on as a credit grantor and you're focused on as an analyst are relatively
1% in this industry or that industry. So the list of sort of concerning industries, entertainment, travel, things like
that, we have low exposures to because of diversity and mix of portfolio.
You touched on the deferrals, let me just give you a couple perspectives on that. One, on that small business, as I
mentioned earlier, the reason why it's high is there's a lot of doctors and dentists in there and you would expect
that they would pay. But to give you a sense, before their deferral, 95%, 97%, 98% of these people were current
under all the measures, and so they're not people who were struggling. They were people who were current that
just needed a hiatus to their change. The FICO scores for 90-plus-percent of the mortgage deferrals, 95%-plus on
the cards, again, about 90% – 85% I guess are 600 or better, so the average FICO is almost 700 of a deferral. So
you'd expect that people who have deferred are doing it as a matter of convenience and will get back in the flow
once [indiscernible] (00:49:47) reopens.
And so – and the LTVs on the mortgage is again 95% or under – only 5% or 10% are really the FHA, VA of the
deferred program and they're 95% or better, all the rest of it is low – 75% of it is below 80% LTV and stuff. So
these are core people who had a change, we'd expect to start to perform. So we'll see how it plays out, but it's
very different I think than past deferral statuses we had.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
It's a very impressive reserve ratio, and in addition, your CET1 stayed relatively high this quarter as well. I just
wanted to ask a follow-up, Brian, around how you're thinking about the dividend. It's been a question that many
investors have been asking, and maybe if you can give us a sense as to how you think through that question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Let me just – Lee just corrected me. It's 65% of the adverse, not severely adverse I think is what Lee is telling me.
We're in two different locations, so usually he can wave at me when I've made a mistake. But in terms of the
dividend, we've kept the dividend payout ratio below 30% of the sort of normalized earnings level and we did it for
a reason that we – one of our operating principles we want to maintain a dividend. And given what we know,
we've earned twice the dividend this quarter at $0.40 versus an $0.18 payout ratio and we expect that to continue.
And that shows you the 100-plus basis points – 130 basis points of excess capital. We've tested it lots of ways, as
you might expect, as we talk to our board about capital management, as we talk to our board about dividends. On
any given time, we're showing them severely adverse cases, adverse cases and thinking through the pre-tax
PPNR capability of withstanding different reserve builds and outcomes, and so that's what we're doing and plan to
keep it going.

Thank you.

Operator: We'll go now to John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Yeah. Hi. Just a quick follow-up on that. Paul, I know you mentioned in terms of the macro assumptions it's a
weighted average, but what you described is kind of a 2Q deep dive in GDP and then continuing negative for the
rest of the year. Is that kind of the central case? And is there any more details you could provide on that as just
we compare different banks and what macro assumptions are embedded into the reserve? It's helpful to know the
kind of maybe central case of assumptions. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, I mean, just to be clear, what I said was it's a significant drop in GDP in the second quarter and then
negative GDP growth to extend well into 2021, I think approaching all the way to the end of the year. So we view
it as a recessionary outlook. We wouldn't describe it any other way. None of the scenarios that we're looking at
are anything other than a recession, and again, we've captured sort of the tail risk of a severely adverse situation.
In terms of providing – yeah, go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
No. No. Go ahead, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
I was going to say in terms of providing specifics on one variable or another, you've got a lot of variables that go
into these models, many, many, many variables. And so we really believe that to provide that level of detail could
be a little misleading. Unless you have the full context of all the factors that we considered when we set the
allowance, picking one or the other and starting to compare here or there just to us I think would be misleading.
Plus, very importantly, the impact of all those multiple inputs that go into the process will be different from each
bank depending upon the bank's loan mix and, very importantly, the quality of the loan portfolio that they've been
putting on the books for years.
I think Brian just sort of talked about it, but I'll say it again. We've been very focused on prime and super prime
customer borrowers for many years now, so the impacts to us of all those inputs is going to be different. And I
guess, that's what all the information I would want to give you about like one input or another. Hopefully, that
helps you in terms of how we think about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Yeah. And the reference point to CCAR is helpful too. It sounds like what you provided for built into the reserve is
about 60% of the cumulative losses from the Fed's adverse in 2019?

Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, again, as Brian said, that's more of an output, not an input, right? We are developing scenarios based upon
the information we had at the end of the quarter, but it is interesting and it's maybe helpful for all of you in terms of
comparing reserves to really think about the loan mix, the quality of the portfolio, and then of course what people
assumed about the future. But in terms of the loan mix and the quality of the portfolio, there is an independent
view out there. There's an independent view every year. And so if you look at our losses in the severely adverse,
the Fed's stress test, our losses under the severely adverse or our losses under the adverse and then you look at
our reserve and you divide by those losses, you're going to get percentages that are in the range or better than
what you're seeing across the industry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. Got it. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
And remember, those tests basically are an independent way to evaluate the quality of somebody's portfolio and
the mix of somebody's portfolio. So we think, again, we didn't size it that way, but we think that's an interesting
way for you to kind of get some sort of independent perspective on allowances.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Yeah, I think it's helpful for us to compare across banks that way. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
You still have the issue, though, by the way, that every bank is going to have a, you know, this is the first quarter
we're all doing CECL and everybody is going to have to develop their own view of the future, and there's no
evidence right now that you can point to of asset degradation. There's a little bit of NPLs, there's a little bit of
reserved criticized, so we're all doing this based upon just our view of the future, based upon all those inputs that
we use in our models.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2020
Same answer, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Same answer? Well, just how much, I mean, how much more could the reserves get built in the second quarter?
And when you defined a significant drop in GDP, how do you define significant?
I mean, look, I mean, the stock, pre-market looks like it's going to open down 6% or 7%, if my numbers are right,
and you just guided for better NII, and you earned your dividend at least two times, up to four times, depending on
how you compute it. Your book value grew. You have good capital ratios. You have the balance sheet strength to
take the additional charges. So why not just take it for like the worst case that you're allowed to do so, and
communicate that and say all right, your capital is still fine. So, you had one of your peers kind of telegraph that.
You seem to be hesitant to do so, given all of the different variables, I understand, but can you give us any a little
bit more guidance for reserve builds say in the second quarter or the third quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, sure. And again, like you said, we have the liquidity, we have the capital, our reserve build if you look at
independent perspectives from the Fed or other sources, our reserve build as a percentage of future losses under
multiple scenarios that they publish is higher or in the range of our competitors. So that's a lot of information for
you right there.
In terms of your question about hey, what's the likely reserve build in the future? If we thought we were going to
have to add more reserve build in the future, we would have put it into this quarter. That's how the rules work. You
reserve for your expected lifetime losses, so our reserve build reflects what we think as of the end of the quarter
we're going to have to have in losses for the life of the assets on our books.
Now when we get to the end of the second quarter, we may have a different view of the future, and so we may
release reserves or we may increase reserves. The quality of our loan book won't change that much because that
doesn't change that much in the quarter. The mix doesn't change that much because that doesn't change in the
quarter. We've built this loan book based upon years, years of underwriting standards, and so it'll go down, the
reserve will go down in the second quarter or go up in the second quarter, but it'll be based upon a change in our
outlook on the future.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Got it. If I can follow with Brian then. I mean, clearly, the biggest input is when does the economy come back
online, and Brian, you and your firm have as many touchpoints nationally as anybody. There must be some
underlying thought process that goes into the reserve build and the losses about when the economy comes back
online. Kind of what's your base case, best case, bad scenario, what are you seeing, what are your thoughts?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, one thing that is different, Mike, and you well know is the plenary authority embedded in governors, the
mayors, and the President to tell us what to do is overriding here, so we could have a view of what can happen,
but given the health care crisis as is as opposed to demand changes and things that would be out of the general
economic flow or credit risk because commercial real estate got overvalued, the things that we've dealt with in our

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2020
lifetimes as you've dealt with, this is just different. So we have to remind ourselves always this is going to come
down to solving this health care crisis and is number one.
Just to give you some facts of where we stand, and we'll see this play out. As I said earlier, if you look at sort of
the weekly flow of payments across all of means, meaning cash taken out of the ATMs and spent through, checks
written through, ACH, wires and credit and debit card, that was around $60 billion odd a week in
January/February, and now it's running like $51 billion, $52 billion average for the last couple of weeks. But you're
seeing that rate of decline flatten at this point. And if you go and look at geographies based on the data we see,
we've seen it sort of flatten. So you're seeing what might be a relatively – and that's after the unemployment
claims have been filed and we're seeing the unemployment come into the accounts.
You're seeing a rate of, the rate of decline sort of flatten, and as you look at it sort of compared to the rate of
decline year-over-year by week and things like that and different types of industries, they've got into the bottom in
some, travel or entertainment, you've gotten to a more sustainable maybe in drug stores and grocery stores, and
you sort of see the economy running at that level. And so that would imply whatever the 10% over 16%, 15%,
16% decline. That will hold on. We'll watch, but right now that seems to be holding on, the places have been shut
down longer and we'll see that play out as it goes forward to see if that starts to grow from there.
Remember, gas prices are down a lot and gas usage is down a lot. That impacts those numbers also. So we're
looking for those signs. I'm not saying we have anything yet. We're looking for those signs.
We're also looking for how the unemployment affects our customer base, and so we've seen as households that
we have, as unemployment – one of the participants in the household. We have a lot of dual-earning households.
75% of the households that we have who've received unemployment also have someone receiving a regular
paycheck still, and so those types of things will be interesting to see it play out, is that a change in behavior in
terms of what people spend on versus a real crisis in the household because of one wage earner. We'll figure that
out. So we're seeing balances in households especially among the moderately affluent not grow in terms of
checking account balances because people are spending less and storing cash.
We've seen it in the Wealth Management side, people can delay paying their taxes. So all these factors will play
in. It's just a little premature to call anything, Mike, and so that's the factors we're looking at as we look at not only
to your point about how you said potential losses based on our customer base and their behavior and what
happens to them, but also based on our view of the economy opening up. And frankly, our advice to people who
want as to what parts of the economy could have a faster impact with less, they are the health care experts with
less risk of people congregating versus others that might help support a reopening or get activity. Go back to the
dentist or something like that. You could put dentists back to work. That will open up part of the economy that is
usually not closed down for these things and it's a relatively few number of people in a given space or given time.
So I'll leave it to health care experts to make those judgments, but all that's going to come together.
As we move through the quarter, we'll try to give you better insight. But right now, that's what we're seeing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q

All right. So that's why you say reserves could go up or they could be released. You just don't know yet?

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2020
I mean, it's just people are, we all want to see where the end is, you included, Mike. We do too, but the question is
we've got to wait for some time to pass to have a feel for that.

Operator: Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Thanks very much. Maybe one more quickie on allowance and reserves. When I look at the healthy reserve on
card, it makes sense given the macro backdrop we're looking at and unemployment and kind of the linear
relationship with unemployment and card. If you look at say US commercial and non-US commercial in and
around 1%, that's obviously a lot more than we've had lately, but not necessarily the worst thing you could predict
given the world we're looking at.
So I guess my question is when you talk about the quality and the mix of business, and all the things that you
gave us, is the, what I consider, the not as severe reserve on the commercial side, a function of not knowing the
timing, the mix of business? Or is it where you sit in the capital stack, meaning even if some of those companies
run into issues, your historical experience in the last bunch of years has been actually really, really good. So I
know it's probably all of those, but I'm just trying to see if you could talk towards that on the commercial side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Look, we've got $2.16 billion on commercial real estate. Given how we have run our commercial real estate
business over the last 10 years, especially relative to others, we feel that's up from $1.6 billion at January 1.
We've got $1.11 billion on US commercial. Those commercial losses, they just don't run as high because of
collateral and other protections we have in the structure, so we feel pretty good.
If you look at total commercial, we're at $1.16 billion, so we feel good about where we are. And again, it's when
you sort of add all that up and you just look at it relative to the losses that people are projecting including the Fed,
whether it's an adverse scenario or it's an adverse scenario, you're going to come out with percentages that are
pretty healthy on an absolute basis and relative to our peers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
And Glenn, I'd add one thing. Let's go back to the beginning on the pre-tax PPNR, which we all learned after the
last crisis, that earnings power to absorb pay-as-you-go losses on the consumer side in terms of card charge-offs
and things like that or building reserves and then going through on the commercial side, which is what happens
typically, that earnings power is I think what we feel has us in good stead in terms of the ability to absorb
whatever circumstances play out here. And with more liquidity than the start of the year, more capital than we
need, 130 basis points more capital, and the PPNR volume that lets us drive through it. And if you think about that
PPNR when you look at the stress test and stuff, we are running a lot higher than the stress test assume because
they assume there's market losses and things like that which we didn't experience even in the most volatile
periods of time in the markets history.

And so I think as you play this out, whether we can all talk about the reserve of X or Y or Z per thing which is what
you all are focused on and should be focused on, the reality is how much earnings capacity you have to keep
generating capital and keep generating earnings that you can offset whatever comes at you, and that's what we
feel good about.

Thank you both.

Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
If you study that portfolio, remember, it's mostly investment-grade, and if you look at it the other way around, if
you looked at the amount of loans or revolvers that we have in leveraged finance, private equity sponsored
leveraged loans, for example, that's less than 1% of total exposures. We don't have any CLO exposures because
we don't put any of that in our [ph] ALL (01:08:56) portfolio. We've got a fraction a tiny bit in Global Markets for
trading purposes. So that commercial portfolio is relatively high-grade.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2020
Good morning. The net NII guidance obviously helpful and coming off a much better than expected 1Q. I just
wonder if you can give a little more detail in terms of I assume some of the sharp drop is higher bond premium
amortization, lower trading, and then obviously kind of core NIM pressures is how I think about the three buckets.
I don't know if that's right, or you want to parse it differently, but any additional color would be helpful. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, I mean, we did see bond premium amortization in Q1 is always sort of seasonally low or lower. We do
expect an increase in Q2 given the decline in rates in Q1. You've got to remember that prepayment generally lag
moves in NII, well they precede moves in NII – the rate move precede the NII impact by six to eight weeks. What
else did you ask about?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
I assume trading benefit 1Q and is being factored in, and then just kind of call it core NIM pressure from the rate
environment is the third bucket.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. Yeah, trading definitely, we are liability-sensitive in Global Markets, but it's not a huge impact, and it can
bounce around quarter-to-quarter depending upon the type of assets that they're booking, and whether they
bought them at par or above or below par. That influences whether profits show up or revenue shows up in NII or
shows up in market making or similar activities. So that's why we don't give guidance on it because it can change
pretty rapidly depending on what they're buying and selling for clients in Global Markets. But right now, it was a
little bit liability-sensitive and did help a little bit in Q1 and it'll probably help a little bit in Q2.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then as we think about the balance sheet growth component, obviously 2Q average balances will
benefit from the run-up on a period end in 1Q, but I would think as you kind of look to the back-half this year and
beyond, some of those line drawdowns in commercial start to get paid off, so that maybe it's tougher to grow the
balance sheet, or at least tougher to grow loans? I don't know if that's the right way to think about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, I mean, there's no question that commercial revolver lines which spiked in March will start to pay down
once economic conditions start to improve. But obviously the timing of that is very uncertain, so I think we're just
going to have to wait and see. Clearly, we're going to see some carry over from these draws in Q2, and we may
see a very significant amount stay with us for some time. We'll just have to wait-and-see.
Obviously, deposit balances also benefit NII because you don't necessarily have to make a loan. You can earn on
those deposit balances, and they're way up as well, and they may be with us for a little while. We'll just have to
wait and see.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2020
Okay. And then just last quickie.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Just so you know, our NII guidance, I'm not going to get into the details, but our NII guidance of course assumes
some sort of runoff. We're making some sort of guesses at this point about what the runoff would be in both loan
and deposits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Understood. And then just lastly, a quick one on the spread of the commercial lines drawdowns. Any rough
numbers on that? I'm often asked that question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. Sure. The spread on the drawdowns were no different than what they were pre-crisis because they're just
drawdowns. They are existing arrangements. We worked with some clients to adjust the liquidity we were giving
them. There were a few new loans in there that were at higher spreads, but most of the spreads were the same
as were spreads pre-crisis, so you're not going to get a spread benefit on those draws.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Maybe like a LIBOR plus 150 or 200?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, given the quality of our loan book, I wouldn't go as high as LIBOR plus 150.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks so much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.

Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, in terms of who drew. Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
But one thing, just to back up, there will be a transitory impact we should all hope of these draws and stuff, and
that means more stability in the market, more reopening of the economy. So – but what isn't transitory is the good
core work that went on in our consumer business, our Wealth Management businesses, and the treasury
services, the core growth levels that will continue through even if the deposits that people have built in part go

back into other forms or get used up. And so I think that's going to be the trick. For a little while, we'll all going to
be preoccupied with the pace of those loans dropping off, et cetera.
But the route is over the long-term, we're going to be based more on the way that underlying has performed going
into this, and frankly, the amount of activity that can continue in the underlying business given this COVID virus
situation. And our officers are making contact. Our wealth managers, we're continuing to add accounts in various
businesses, not at the rate that you would before, but because just necessarily is not face-to-face meetings taking
place, but you're seeing the Wealth Management contacts are up. You're seeing even the referrals, which means
our lines of businesses continue. It's just at a lower rate because of the necessities of the face-to-face meeting
limitations. But those will come back as soon as we can get back in action.

Operator: We'll go now to Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Kleinhanzl Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. Good morning. Quick question. I know you commented on the consumer deferrals that you were seeing,
but what's kind of been the trends on the corporate side as well and kind of what's been the inbound with regards
to using some of these government programs from your clients out there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
In terms of the government programs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Kleinhanzl Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, 12 days ago, we started taking applications in the PPP program. We've had hundreds of thousand
applications. We're processing them in accordance with the guidance that was given by Treasury to get the work
done and then submit them. Thousands have been through the SBA [ph] and have a number (01:17:03) and we
have thousands – many thousands [ph] in the hands of clients (01:17:03) that are signing promissory notes and
we're funding them. So that is still, I think, for the whole industry the real impact economic, the money traveling
out is coming, will come over the next period of time here.
Today, we received the first major distribution of the direct payments in terms of the $1,200 stimulus payment
types. We're seeing now the unemployment benefits, the extra $600-type thing coming through and the benefit
structures we're seeing – and the programs we're seeing both, as we service the state as a provider of prepaid
card type card access to those programs, and we see in our accounts.
So those programs are just barely hitting the general consumer, general business, et cetera, for us and for the
industry. Our industry peers are all in the same condition. And so they will provide – the stimulus they will provide
is actually going to be from now on, not from now backwards because this is a program that didn't exist literally
three weeks ago, only started 12 days ago, and several hundred thousand people have applied for it and we're
processing through it as fast as we can, and it's around 10,000, 12,000 on the more commercial banking side of
the play.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2020
Brian Kleinhanzl Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And just a separate question. I know you've built a big qualitative reserve now with CECL, but kind of what are
your expectations with regards to how the charge-offs will roll through given all of the deferrals that are going on?
Forbearance which could push potential charge-offs out to a year or more. Are you really looking that you may not
see much of an uptick this year and this really could be 2021 before you start to see meaningful degradation in
the charge-offs? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So the total amounts, as you saw on page 5 of the balance of deferrals, so if you go to the inverse of that, 95%
and we see – of the cards are not deferred, and they will pay us and stuff. So I think the question is what really
happens, to your point, so we deferred somebody who is a 750 FICO who temporarily lost their job or thought
they are going to lose their job [indiscernible] (01:19:14) and just wanted a month, that'll come back. And so I think
the losses will shake out into the fall because just the methodology is, you remember, it's to the 180 days you
have to roll through all the buckets and stuff.
So we'll see it play out, but it's going to be delayed. But remember, because the CECL, you're providing for your
expected outcome under that delay, and Paul gave you the parameters of what we talked about already. So the
question is that's what we're putting up at the end of the first quarter, when we get to second quarter, we'll put it
up, and then third quarter all based on what we think the credit costs will be of that portfolio over the cycle ahead
of us. Down into the trough and then back out the other side in a very slow matter as Paul described.
And then the real question will be sort of people's behavior given these government programs, and the amount of
extra cash going in and then on the employment, the PPP program is employ people and pay people, you get
eight weeks of pay to pay them out, and so we'll see how that all metes out to the underlying people. But so I think
it's premature, but I think it will delay charge-offs. But our reserve at any given moment reflect what we think will
ultimately happen to those customers, not when it'll happen.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey. Thanks a lot. Hey, Paul, just a couple of follow-ups on the NII front for you. With LIBOR expanding versus
Fed funds and the TED spread still wide, which typically happens obviously in times of stress, how are you
expecting that to traject as you talk about your $11 billion number and just your expectation for rates in the long
end of the curve?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah, so we're basically factoring in a timing between LIBOR and Fed funds over the year, but we're also
factoring in some loan and deposit growth offsetting that. And then of course, we've got securities and other

assets maturing that we're going to replace at a lower yield, and all that's factored into our perspective that we
think, with loan and deposit growth, we can – you'll see NII kind of at that $11 billion level give or take roughly
through the end of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
So, with all the cash that's sitting on the balance sheet, and like you said earlier, you're expecting some tapering
of that, what is the asset liability decision about what to invest and what you're putting it in? And so, like, what's
the kind of go-to investment rate versus what's coming off?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, right now, that excess liquidity that all came flooding in is in cash, and we'll have to think about what we
want to do with that excess liquidity as it becomes clearer kind of how long it's going to stick around. Right now, if
you just look at what's in our securities portfolio and compare to the yields available to reinvest, they would be 50
basis points lower. But all that's kind of factored into our guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Right. And one more question on the deposit side. Can you just talk about across the businesses what you're
seeing from customers in terms of money coming out of the markets and whether it's sitting in money market
mutual funds, in Wealth Management or whether it's moved on to the balance sheet, and just kind of how that ties
into your ability to reprice deposits? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Just to start on that, just generally customers put more cash, and you saw that in the Wealth Management
deposits being up $19 billion. So that reflects not only them moving money but also the reallocation in our models
and things like that. So you've seen that.
We'd seen them stabilize. My guess is two-thirds of that was more what you're speaking about, a third or so was
sort of the core growth building up that we saw coming into the tail end of last year into the quarter, maybe a little
less than that. But a lot of it was moving. It'll move back in the markets based on the allocations and methods in
terms of deposit forms of the markets. And then on the money funds, the allocations reflected there, because of
the prime money funds versus the government money funds, there's a lot of instability around that towards the
quarter.
So I think this will all settle out, and you'll see it return to more normal when people are thinking about that. So
you'll see less volume growth in the balance sheet deposit [ph] driven than (01:24:07) Wealth Management.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
I'm not sure what else I would add to that. Obviously, we brought deposit pricing down in Q1. You can see that in
the average by product. They're going to come down further just based upon pricing actions that we've already
taken that are just now going to start rolling into those average deposit pricing across the different types of
products.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 15-Apr-2020
In terms of growth, we obviously saw very strong growth in Q1. There's a lot of moving pieces there, so it's hard to
give guidance on growth from here. I just would emphasize what Brian emphasized earlier that the underlying
spike in deposits, if you look beneath that underlying spike, we still saw solid core organic growth across all our
LOBs in January and February.
In terms of the second quarter, with respect to consumer, you're going to have government stimulus and delayed
tax payments. That's going to be a tailwind. GWIM clients, we'll just have to see they shifted out of investments
into deposits. We're going to have to see how that plays out over time. And then Global Banking, we already
discussed the large deposit inflows in March. Ending deposits grew $94 billion quarter-over-quarter. As the
markets stabilize and economic activity returns, we do expect some component of those deposit balances to flow
out over time as clients pay down their lines, to pay other bills and redeploy liquidity. So we've kind of factored all
that in, but at this point there's a lot of uncertainty.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Sorry about that earlier. But let me just jump in and not hold everybody up that much. In your loan drawdowns,
you said 90% investment-grade. What percentage of those were BBB minus, and what are you thinking as you
reserve how many of those are more vulnerable or more at risk of downgrades?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well over 90% were investment-grade or secured. I don't have how many were BBB minus in front of me.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And going back to, I know just looking at the reserve build, sorry to go back to that, but it is the question of
the day. You've talked about GDP staying negative well into 2021. Can you give some color on what you're
thinking in terms of unemployment? How high do you see your weighted-average in 2021?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
As I said before, we're not really providing that level of detail because we think comparisons on this input versus
that input when there's 30 or 40 inputs in the models is going to be misleading unless you have a full context of all
factors.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Right. Okay. Another one and Small Business, the deferrals that you've seen so far probably going to rise. What
are you thinking in terms of as you've done your reserving what percentage of those ultimately may not make it at
this point? [indiscernible] (01:27:42)

Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
That's all right. A substantial part of those Small Business are in a thing called practice solutions which are
doctors and dentists and things like that, and you expect once they open their practice they will pay because they
don't want to lose their equipment practice. So it's a little different than the general small business that have, and
that's why that number is elevated just because of who the dominance of that portfolio as a percentage of the
total. So we expect a lot of it will come back and will see that play out as parts of the economy reopen.
Thank you, Vivek.

And we're going to move to close here because we've got an endpoint at 10:00, and so let me just close quickly.
Thank you, all of you for your time this morning. Number one, please keep your families and yourselves safe as
we go through the rest of this health crisis. Simply put, we earned $4 billion. We added substantially to our
reserves based on our view at the end of the quarter. Our capital ratio is 130 basis points over our minimums. The
liquidity is increased during the quarter, but importantly, we drove responsible growth, supported our teammates,
our clients, and our communities and delivered, I think for the shareholders too, given the circumstances that
were going on.
As we look forward, we'll continue to keep you apprised of what we're seeing on our client base due to our
purview and as we see that, we'll continue to try to keep people informed to help people understand how the
