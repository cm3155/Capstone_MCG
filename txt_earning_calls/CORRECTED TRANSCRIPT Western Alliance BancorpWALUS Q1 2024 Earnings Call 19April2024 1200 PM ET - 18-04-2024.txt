Q1 2024 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2024
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good day, everyone. Welcome to Western Alliance Bancorporation's First Quarter 2024 Earnings
Call. You may also view the presentation today via webcast through the company's website at
www.westernalliancebancorporation.com.
I would now like to turn the call over to Miles Pondelik, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Development.
Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Miles Pondelik
Head of Corporate Development & Investor Relations, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thank you and welcome to Western Alliance Bank's first quarter 2024 conference call. Our speakers today are
Ken Vecchione, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dale Gibbons, Chief Financial Officer; and Tim Bruckner,
our Chief Banking Officer for Regional Banking, who will join for Q&A.
Before I hand the call over to Ken, please note that today's presentation contains forward-looking statements
which are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions except as required by law. The company does not
undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. For more complete discussion of the risks
and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements, please
refer to the company's SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed yesterday, which are available on the company's
website.
Now for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken Vecchione.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Good morning, everyone. I'll make some brief comments about our first quarter earnings before turning the call
over to Dale. He will review the financial results in more detail. I'll come back and discuss the 2024 outlook, and
then Tim Bruckner, our Chief Banking Officer, will join us for Q&A.
For the last three quarters, the mission of the company has been to reposition the balance sheet and optimize our
funding structure to establish an unassailable foundation of higher capital, liquidity, and insured and collateralized
deposits, and further distance us from last launch. Together, these factors should provide a bulwark to better
insulate the bank from future industry and market volatility, as well as support more predictable, superior, long-
term returns. This quarter, we generate exceptional deposit growth of $6.9 billion that accelerated our
repositioning plan at a faster pace than anticipated. We reached our CET1 capital target of 11%, lowered our HFI
loan-to-deposit ratio by 10 points to 81%, and increased our already leading insured deposit ratio to 81%.
Our liquidity profile was also enhanced by a $6.5 billion increase in unencumbered securities and cash from year
end, which also will allow us to pay down – which also allow us to pay down borrowings by $1 billion. In summary,
our repositioning goals have largely been accomplished. I'm pleased that during the quarter of outsized liquidity
growth, Western Alliance earned $1.72 per share, excluding the increased special assessment from the FDIC and
tangible book value continue to climb despite rate headwinds. Asset quality remains steady with special mention
loans and classified assets declining $139 million. In aggregate from Q4, net charge-offs remain low at only 8
basis points of average loans. Our excellent liquidity positions us to drive stronger loan growth starting in Q2.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2024
Loan growth should track proportionately with deposits to maintain our improved loan-to-deposit ratio and allow us
to exit 2024 in line with market expectations.
Dale will now take you through the financial results.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Thanks, Ken. During the first quarter, Western Alliance generated reported pre-provision net revenue of $247
million, net income of $177 million, and earnings per share of $1.60. Excluding the $18 million FDIC special
assessment charge, PPNR was $265 million, net income $191 million, and earnings per share was $1.72. Net
interest income increased $7 million from Q4 to $599 million from higher average earning asset balances as well
as lower average borrowings. Non-interest income of $130 million increased $39 million quarter-over-quarter from
consistent performance in mortgage banking, including an improved MSR valuation from a higher balance of
servicing rights owned. We look at mortgage revenue holistically because our conservative valuation process,
when servicing rates are created, often results in understated MSR values, which dampen gain-on-sale revenue.
GAAP non-interest expense was $482 million or $464 million, excluding the FDIC special assessment. Deposit
costs of $137 million were $6 million above Q4 levels, essentially offsetting the net interest income growth during
the quarter and driven by strong deposit growth from both existing and new clients in our HOA and Juris Banking
businesses along with the continued rebound in mortgage warehouse from seasonal lows. Typical seasonal
factors as well as the reset of incentive compensation accruals which were discounted in 2023 were the primary
reasons for the increase in salaries and employee benefits in Q1. Provision expense of $15 million resulted from
loan growth as well as $9.8 million in net charge-offs, while our economic outlook remained stable. Lastly, our
effective tax rate fell to 23.5% from a temporarily elevated rate last quarter.
Loans held for investment grew $403 million to $50.7 billion, while deposits increased $6.9 billion to $62.2 billion
at quarter end. As a result, our held for investment loan-to-deposit ratio fell to 81% from 91% last quarter.
Outsized deposit growth accelerated our liquidity building efforts. Securities and cash increased by $0.4 billion
quarter-over-quarter and allowed for a further $1 billion reduction in borrowings. Finally, tangible book value per
share expanded $0.58 for the quarter to $47.30 from retained earnings, which more than offset a modest rate
driven increase in our negative AOCI position.
Held for investment loan growth of $403 million incurred predominantly in C&I categories. Commercial and
industrial growth of $646 million demonstrated noteworthy progress in our regional commercial banking strategy,
as well as success in both mortgage warehouse and tech and innovation. C&I growth also mitigated a purposeful
reduction in commercial real estate. On a year-over-year basis, total loans increased $4.3 billion, almost entirely
from C&I production, which has been a point of emphasis for the bank.
Outstanding deposit growth of $6.9 billion resulted from broad-based growth and market share gains from our
regions, commercial deposit businesses, and digital consumer channels. More specifically, our regions
contributed approximately $1 billion, HOA and digital consumer each over $800 million, Juris Banking over $400
million, and corporate trust added $160 million. Mortgage warehouse deposits re-acquired the $3.5 billion and
fully replaced Q4 outflows as our DDA deposit balance at March 31st surpassed where we were at September
30th. Overall, in the more stable rate environment, we are experiencing minimal mix shift of existing client funds
into higher cost deposits.
Turning now to our net interest drivers, held for investment loan yields increased 12 basis points due to the higher
rate environment. Loan growth was weighted toward the end of the quarter as demonstrated by period end loan

balances exceeding average balances by $1 billion. The yield on total securities decreased 33 basis points to
4.66% from our efforts to significantly enhance our liquidity profile, which resulted in total high-quality liquid
securities, increasing $4.8 billion from Q4. In addition, the proportion of average interest earning assets invested
in securities and cash increased to 23% from 21% in the fourth quarter as a result of these repositioning efforts,
which have largely been completed.
These efforts position us well to deploy incremental funds into higher yielding commercial loans earlier than
initially expected, as well as to manage the cost of deposits lower ahead of Fed rate cuts. The cost of total interest
bearing deposits expanded 11 basis points, while the total cost of funds was flat at 2.82% as average short-term
borrowings declined $1.8 billion to 8% of average interest bearing liabilities. In aggregate, net interest income
increased approximately $7 million, while net interest margin of 3.60% compressed 5 basis point due to the
earning asset mix shift in securities we discussed.
Additionally, adjusting for the increased FDIC special assessment and deposit costs, our adjusted efficiency ratio
for the quarter was 54.4%, which also reflected higher seasonal costs. Deposit costs moved up only $6 million or
4.6% quarter-over-quarter, even though average balances of ECR-related deposits grew $1.4 billion or 7%.
Asset quality metrics continue to remain steady and are reflective of our ongoing, forward-looking portfolio
monitoring and proactive credit mitigation strategy, which produce low realized losses. In aggregate, special
mention loans and classified assets declined $139 million from Q4. Non-performing assets increased $126 million
to $407 million or 53 basis points of total assets, as we execute our strategy to accelerate resolution for this
subset of loans and proactively address them before reaching maturity. Notably, about two-thirds of our NPLs are
paying as agreed with regard to debt service obligations.
As stated previously, we've largely avoided the largest urban centers for commercial real estate lending that have
experienced more value contraction in the nation at large. We see that in our submarkets, which we watch
closely, our borrowers' projections continue to perform better with more stable appraisals than other markets.
Quarterly net loan charge-offs were $9.8 million or 8 basis points of average loans. Provision expense of $15.2
million covered net charge-offs and provided reserves in concert with loan growth. Our allowance for funded loans
increased $4 million from the prior quarter to $340 million, and the allowance for credit loss ratio to funded loans
of 74 basis points was stable, covering 94% of non-performing loans. The valuation of NPLs, which primarily
consists of real estate secured credits, are confirmed by fair value appraisals of collateral.
Our CET1 ratio, again, grew 20 points to 11%, or 10% when adjusted for our negative AOCI position, which is 160
basis points higher year-over-year and 230 basis points above our Q3 2022 level when our repositioning efforts
began.
Our tangible common equity to total assets ratio moved down approximately 50 basis points from Q4 to 6.8%, as
asset growth and low risk categories exceeded organic capital accretion from higher earnings.
Tangible book value per share increased $0.58 from December 31st to $47.30 from retained earnings growth
outpacing the higher AOCI offset. Our consistent upward trajectory and tangible book value per share has
outpaced peers by over 4 times since 2013, including strong growth in 2023.
I'll now hand the call back to Ken.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2024
Kenneth A. Vecchione
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Okay. Thanks, Dale. We have transformed the bank several times in the company's history, starting as a Las
Vegas Bank in 1994 and expanding into Arizona and California in 2003.
In 2010, after the GFC, during which we were landlocked in some of the most stressed markets nationally, we
began our diversification strategy into national business lines, with HOA and mortgage warehouse that created
diversity, growth and sustainable earnings without undue risk.
In 2015 and 2016, we added Bridge Bank to enter into the tech and innovation economy, and then purchased the
hotel franchise finance business, which provided expertise and deep industry knowledge, enabling us to become
a leader in that vertical.
In 2018 and 2019, the bank entered, developed and launched three specialty deposit verticals, settlement
services, business escrow services and corporate trust, that expanded business diversification strategy and
produced access to new deposit sources.
In 2023, we launched a digital consumer deposit strategy to gain access to a granular deposit base. Now, in
2024, the company has worked hard to reposition and fortify its balance sheet and liquidity. Informed by the
events of last launch, the management team continues to optimize funding, significantly improve capital and carry
higher levels of insured and collateralized deposits to form a solid, sturdy balance sheet which can be used as the
foundation to reignite earnings, grow the balance sheet and generate organic capital, while ensuring asset quality
remains safe and protected.
So what does WAL look like in the future? Well, using and reinforcing the discipline I just mentioned, Western
Alliance has and will continue to have risk management architecture that will enhance the company's guardrails
as we continue to develop new organic avenues for growth to deliver consistent upper teens return on tangible
common equity and sustainable earnings growth that maintains historical capital accumulation at multiples higher
than other banks.
We are excited that the repositioning strategy has been largely completed. We have fortified our balance sheet,
which will allow the company to generate earnings velocity through the back half of 2024 and into 2025.
To that end, from our first quarter results, we update our 2024 guidance as follows. Continued thoughtful balance
sheet growth at a slightly higher level, building on the momentum of Q1 and more focus on deploying incremental
liquidity into sound, safe and thoughtful loans. Our current loan-to-deposit ratio provides flexibility to selectively
make more loans as opportunities arise. For the full year, loans are expected to grow $4 billion, up from $2 billion,
given the new client wins and current pipelines. We also expect deposits to end the year up $11 billion, which is
$3 billion above our previous consensus.
Turning to capital, we expect our CET1 ratio to remain steady at or near 11%, capturing the forecasted increase
in loan volume. Regarding net interest income, we reaffirm our 5% to 10% growth expectation from Q4 2023's
annualized jumping off point and are tracking to the upper end of this range. Our rate outlook includes two 25
basis point cuts in the back half of the year.
In a higher for longer rate environment without rate cuts by the FRB, we would expect NIM to incrementally
benefit by mid-single digit basis points from loans repricing in an elevated rate environment. Our expectation is

that net interest margin will trough in Q2, with the full impact of our liquidity build, while net interest income will
continue to move higher from Q1 levels.
NIM should ascend due to repricing of existing loans and new loan originations, which all-in should generate a full
year NIM in the low-3.50s. Non-interest income should increase 10% to 20% from an adjusted 2023 baseline level
of $397 million. Mortgage banking related income remains somewhat dependent on the rate environment and
mortgage volume. But we are encouraged by the resilience of the Q1 results. Non-interest expense, inclusive of
ECR related deposit costs, is now expected to rise 6% to 9% from an annualize adjusted Q4 baseline of $1.74
billion, primarily from the accelerated ECR related deposit growth we achieved in Q1, which helped the company
reach liquidity targets earlier than expected. In aggregate, these factors should enable Western Alliance to
consistently grow PPNR throughout the year and establish a higher baseline headed into 2025. Asset quality
continues to remain steady and is performing as expected with continued sponsor support of projects. Our full
year net charge-off guidance remains 10 to 15 basis points of average loans.
At this time, Dale, Tim, and I look forward to answering your questions.

Good morning, Jared.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Thanks. Looking at the guidance with the expense growth primarily coming from the ECR, I guess, why wouldn't
that also help drive higher expectation for NII? You're saying, looking at the higher end of that, but if with this big
deposit growth and the opportunity for loan growth, I guess what's – are we giving up all of that spread early
stages to the ECR?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
No. It will help drive NII. The issue is, is that growth came in kind of ratably over the first quarter. We haven't
genned up to the degree we can the origination of good quality credit to disperse those additional funds. That's
going to take a process within, say, the second quarter. So it will catch up. But the second quarter is a little bit of a
pivot point whereby we're going to look for higher asset growth than we had in Q1. And that's going to hold that,
the second quarter back a bit.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2024
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
The prior guide, let me just add, the prior guide included for rate cuts which have now been revised to two cuts.
To offset that, we've also increased our loan growth from $500 million a quarter to $1 billion a quarter. And that's
what helps our net interest income throughout the rest of the year continue to grow quarter-to-quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. All right. Thanks for that. I guess maybe shifting a little to the capital and now that you're at the target floor
of 11%. How should we be thinking about the desire to grow that from here? And can you give an update on how
the credit linked notes impact that going forward and sort of the timing on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So we see capital remaining modestly at or above 11% for the remainder of the year, increasing loan
growth above trend will absorb the excess capital formation for the rest of the year. I will note that since we
started our repositioning strategy on capital from Q3 of 2023, we've increased the CET1 ratio 230 basis points
without raising capital. We do have a couple of CLNs embedded into these numbers. And the runoff of the CLNs
is very modest year-over-year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. As you recall, we collapsed two of our CLNs last year, the mortgage warehouse and capital call. We've got
a few residentials that are – that don't have substitution credits in them. So they are just running off. We're gaining
about 40 to 50 basis points in CET1 from that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Casey Haire with Jefferies. Casey, please go
ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Question on the loan and deposit growth, just wondering how you guys got
to those numbers. I mean, you guys have demonstrated that you're capable of putting up stronger growth than
that. And I'm just wondering if it's conservative or if you're just looking to manage the growth and have an eye on,
obviously, the $100 billion line, so just some color there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So, Casey, while we continue to remain cautious about the future economic activity and we have de-
emphasized certain asset classes. We do believe that we can actively grow loan $1 billion per quarter, and we
feel rather comfortable with that based on the pipelines that get reviewed on a weekly basis. So we are de-
emphasizing certain areas, as you would expect. CRE office, residential, general construction, a little cautious on
multi-family, but we see better opportunities in warehouse lending group, MSR lending, the regional C&I business
is beginning to take hold, resource lending and maybe lot banking also give us the best risk reward dynamics on
the loan side. So if we can do better than $1 billion, we will, as long as it's safe, sound and thoughtful growth. And
the economic environment hasn't changed. But right now, we feel comfortable with the $1 billion.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2024
As it relates to the deposit guide, we certainly had a monster quarter at $6.9 billion. A lot of that came in because
of our – we think because of our debt service levels. And we had a number of market share wins as well as a
number of our new deposit verticals have really begun to take hold. Settlement service had a good quarter.
Corporate trust is growing. HOA had its best quarter ever. It was monstrous. Okay. And in fact, we think we are
now the leader in HOA deposits in the industry. And then the regions also had a very good quarter as well for $1
billion. So taken together, all that informs us that we think we're comfortable growing deposits $2 billion a quarter
for the rest of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I will say and something we're proud of here, when you look at – when you look back over a year, we've grown
total deposits by $14.3 billion. If you take out $1 billion for broker deposits, we grew $13 billion in a year. And that
kind of gives us the confidence level to say that $2 billion seems very reasonable and practical.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. Okay. And then just switching to the expense front, just to clarify, does the expense guide do include the
$17 million FDIC assessment for this year? And then, if I layer in your guide, it looks like it's delivering an
efficiency ratio in the low-60s. That's obviously with the deposit cost, but it's obviously running a little bit higher
than what you've been guiding to in the past. I think it's been around 50%. So just wondering, what's the new
expectation on that front?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I would look for something in kind of the mid-50s. We were 54% for the first quarter as you saw
there. There were some seasonality in costs which we talked about, a little bit primarily related to compensation
[indiscernible] (00:24:29). But we do believe that we can get that number back to beginning with a 4 again. But we
would hope to have better performance. I think it's always much stronger from AmeriHome in that process. We do
think that there's a significant kind of pent up demand with AmeriHome and that there is a lot of people that do
want to move out of their house, but they're kind of there along with their mortgage rate presently as the – when
we have that dip down at the FOMC, commentary after the CPI impact in January, that really kind of came back
and we saw a lot more activity. You saw that in our numbers. So with that, on the denominator side, more steady
situation on the numerator side regarding ECR. We think that number can trail down over time. But for now, I
keep it in the mid-50s.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Casey, on the FDIC special assessment, that's not in our numbers, in our guide. And our adjusted efficiency is
going to be in the low-50s as we work that down towards the high-40s. But that's what I would say. Okay.

Hi, everybody. I want to start...

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. So let me start on the deposit side. Ken, I thought you said you thought you could grow deposits $2 billion
per quarter, is that right? Because that would take you above the $11 billion for the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, on average, $2 billion a quarter. But Q4 is a little softer, as you've seen last quarter where the warehouse
lending deposits roll out. So we think that's more of a practical guide. Basically, we're just trying to tell you, think
about the end number of $11 billion is where we think we'll end up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. It's funny, Ken, I've asked you, I don't know, maybe two or three calls in a row. Once you get to your
targets, how should we think about Western Alliance and growth desire, appetite, where you could be long-term.
So if we think about, if we average this out, you're probably $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion per quarter loans and deposits
run rate, so call it $0.5 billion per year for each, is that about – and adjusting for loan-to-deposit ratio, is that how
we should think about this now that you're at target, maybe that $5 billion-ish growth per year balance sheet?

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2024
So we've got a number of levers to pull and we have a great deal of optionality. So first thing I'd say is in the way
we're thinking about it is from here, whatever liquidity we bring in, whatever deposit growth we bring in, we would
like to put out at about 80% loan-to-deposit ratio. So we could stay between that 80% and 85% level. And that's
what we're going to try to target going forward. It'll take a little while to build up that loan growth engine because
obviously if we're telling you $2 billion in deposits and $1 billion to loans, that's not 80%. But we're genning that
back up again. You've got to get the deals done. You've got to get them documented. You've got to have clients
put their cash in before we put our funding in. And that will just build up as we go throughout 2024 and into 2025.
And then if we do better than that, meaning higher deposits or the loans stay in that $1 billion plus range, then
we'll use some of that incremental liquidity and we'll use it to pay down borrowings. And that will also use the
growth of the balance sheet.
Dale, you want to add anything to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. I mean, so stated another way, I expect that we can exceed those numbers, Steve, a bit because we're
paying down borrowings coincident with growing deposits faster than your $5 billion a year number.

Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Chris McGratty with KBW. Chris, please go
ahead.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. Good morning. Ken, Dale, it feels like – the $100 billion has obviously has got a ton of attention. It feels
like you've, more or less, addressed every piece of it. Obviously, there's ongoing regulation. But liquidity
expenses, capital, is that the message you're trying to send with the last two actions over last few quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So we are taking actions today and preparing to cross over $100 billion in a few years. Okay. The
improvements we've made in our risk management architecture, both on capital analysis, liquidity analysis, and
planning, indicated to us that it was better to build that liquidity reservoir early on; and we wanted to get that done,
and we've accomplished that. The other thing was, let's get capital out of the way. We think 11%, around that
number is the right number going forward. So we've done all that.
But behind the scenes also, Chris, is a lot more risk management build that has to occur. That's been basically
built into the company over the last couple of years. So where we are today, we'll say we're about 75% of the way
towards being ready to be $100 billion. $100 billion is just the number for us. We're not looking to get there
sooner. It all depends on, again, the economy and the opportunities that we have in front of us. But what we don't
want to happen is we don't want to be stopped when we hit that level. So we want to grow in an unencumbered
way. In the meantime, the risk architecture that we're putting into the company is paying dividends and does have
a return and how we think and manage the company. So we're happy that we're doing that as well.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2024
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Bernard von-Gizycki with Deutsche Bank. Your
line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard von-Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. So you guys had a nice quarter with fees, but you didn't change the full year non-interest
income guide outlook. You noted mortgage will be dependent on rates, but you were encouraged by the resilient
results. I mean, how should we think about maybe the seasonality after 1Q, the different fee lines for rest of the
year? Additionally, equity investments have picked up the past two quarters. Wondering if you could provide any
color there and how you think it should trend for the rest of year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So there are a couple of questions inside of that. I'll take a shot at it and Dale will fill in if I miss anything. But a
good portion of the fee income comes from mortgage. I would say that mortgage hangs around the hoop for the
next couple of quarters, similar to that of Q1 and of course Q4 for mortgage is always lighter because of seasonal
reasons. The gains you mentioned on the warrants, that's very consistent with the prior quarter. It consists of
valuing over 500 positions every quarter. And as the tech business grows, we expect there to be more positions
to be valued. And right now, we don't see a retracement in value at this time. And we think the way we're valuing,
based on where the tech industry is, we're valuing it at the lower point of the cycle.
Dale, would you add anything?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Just a couple things. So on the seasonality implication, so HOA, their best quarter is Q1, and that helped –
contributed to an early $7 billion increase there as well as the recovery in kind of mortgage warehouse deposits.
So I would expect that future quarters are going to be lower than what we put out in the first quarter. And in terms
of our guidance, we are tracking towards the upper end of our guide that's in the book regarding net interest
income. But frankly, we're a little above the midpoint for non-interest income as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard von-Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Got it. And Dale, I think you noted earlier that you don't expect much deposit mix shift from here. Obviously,
the quarter was great with the amount of deposits you brought in, but the mix shift was obviously favorable,
mostly the non-interest bearing. And then, obviously, in the interest bearing, there is less focus on the higher cost
CDs. When you think about the rest of the year, you kind of said the minimal mix, where are you kind of thinking
for the additional $4 billion would be kind of similar as we kind of look out to the outside quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, if I put on my optimistic hat, I mean, we're really doing some creative things in the regions which would be a
primary source of where we might get non-interest bearing deposits. And I would hope that we could actually
show growth there. We certainly saw growth in the first quarter, and we're looking for that to continue. As you –
maybe the trend you allude to, in terms of CDs, I think that that is going to continue to taper off as we run through
2024. And of course, the preponderance of growth is going to come in money market.

Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ben Gerlinger with Citi. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Good morning, guys. Sorry about the background noise, I had to step out. I just had a question in terms of the
ECR. I know you guys lowered it – the cut expectations to kind of two in the latter half of this year. But just kind of
thinking philosophically, if we have two more in the early part of next year, so a total of four, just kind of pushed it
out six months, do you think next year's expenses could actually be flat, if not down?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. I think that can certainly be the case, also would probably help with revenue significantly on AmeriHome, as
we discussed as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Yeah. Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Said another way, we were talking about this earlier. I was going to say, any future rate cuts into 2025 will help
fund any inflation we have in the base. And I think that's what you're suggesting.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
One more point, getting to Ken's comment earlier about optionality, one thing that this pool of liquidity gives us to
enable us to do is to really one-off some of our higher cost ECRs now, which we are undertaking to push them
down. And so we can get in front of FOMC action with lower funding cost. You saw that a little bit in Q4 to Q3
when the average ECR actually declined slightly. We'd like to see more of that of course.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got you. That's great and nice to see you all get back to the kind of a powerhouse that you used to be in terms of
growth potential. Kind of with that though, have you guys thought about any sort of potential M&A, not necessarily
go over $100 billion, but just bolt-on technology or any kind of fintechs, just any sort of capital deployment outside
of the share repurchase?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
So still for us, a little premature to think about M&A. And I would say, given the prospects that we see in front of
us, we'd like to take any excess capital that we have and put it into organic growth. We think that would serve us
best.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2024
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Matthew Clark with Piper Sandler. Matthew,
please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. On your interest bearing deposit costs, you're up 11 bps this quarter, I
think the prior quarter up 7, can you give us a spot rate on interest bearing deposits? And what's your outlook
there? Is it fair to assume that that rate of change will start to slow here or maybe stabilize next quarter or two?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. We're looking at really kind of stability across the board, both on asset repricing and on kind of liability here.
There hasn't been – since it's obviously been – since last September kind of the last kind of rate changes we're
talking about in July. It's really kind of tapered off and the volatility is very stable. As I mentioned earlier, I think
you see that net interest income going up approximately the same amount as the earnings credit cost rose. So
there is no great disparities between spot rates and kind of average rates presently.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Well, what I would add is that, while deposit costs went up, we got rid of $1 billion in borrowings and our overall
cost of funds stayed flat quarter-to-quarter. So when you think about what happened for the quarter relative to net
interest margin, our loan yield went up 12 basis points, our deposit cost went up a 11. We paid down debt. And
really the bottom line here is the margin dropped a little bit because of the excess liquidity we brought in that we're
keeping on the balance sheet in cash and in investment securities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yep. Got it. Okay. And then just last one for me. The uptick in classified assets and non-performers, can you just
speak to what drove those increases and kind of plan for resolution there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Sure, sure. Tim Bruckner, I'll take that. So first, I'll just say, the majority is related to secured investor real estate
loans. This really results as a function of how we manage our portfolio. So as we've taken every opportunity to tell
all of our constituents, we press hard for re-margining and have since early in the rate increase cycle. That drives
to resolution. So the classified loans will move up as we reach the endpoint of the negotiation that doesn't resolve
in effective re-margin. We then take those loans and we ledger the balance appropriately based on the value of
the asset. We apply all principal and interest payments received to reduce that loan balance. And I think it's
important to note on our books that two-thirds of these are current in terms of payments being made. So we're not
waiting for a delinquency to take our action here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
And all the ones we moved in this quarter were all paid as well.

Correct, Ken.

Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Timur Braziler with Wells Fargo. Your line is now
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Thanks. Maybe just following up on that last line of questioning. Could you just talk us through the interplay
between non-performing loan migration and the allowance? I guess I was a little surprised to see NPLs move
higher, while overall allowance levels pretty much flat quarter-on-quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Sure. Tim again. I think it's important to note this context that the majority – we have a very small charge-off every
quarter. The majority of the charge that we took this quarter was really associated with adjusting the balances of
those loans as they migrate so that we have plenty of coverage based on current appraised value of the asset,
less the cost of liquidity. So we move fairly aggressively and into non-performing. We adjust our balance as
opposed to placing just reserves on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And just the migration itself doesn't necessarily...

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
What was that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Absolutely right. And so when we talk about our philosophy here, we're a low loan deposit lender. When you look
at office, underwritten office at 50%, 58%, 59% is where we're at. So we look at this in the economy of credit
underwriting collateral, and our collateral position creates character and creates support from sponsorship. And
that's what we see demonstrated. So it carries through that we typically have very low loan to carrying values
throughout the entire, throughout the process where we get close, we make an adjustment, take a charge, and
stay in balance.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2024
Our charge-off rate for the quarter annualized was 8 basis points, which is only about maybe a fifth or a fourth of
what the industry is. Our reserve level is 74 basis points [indiscernible] (00:42:27) in the appendix of the earnings
release, we walk that up to the 130 level considering the things that we have that we do that others don't do, like
the higher levels of residential real estate as well as CLMs we talked about a little bit. And so we think that's
actually a pretty strong level at 74 basis points. So if you take 8 basis points in the 74, you've got nine years of
loss coverage within there. Well, our duration of our loan book is under four.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I'd add more than anything, when we look at this category, it's performing as expected and moving to resolution
as expected.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then maybe as my follow-up, just looking at the securities purchases this quarter, can you give us the
bridge just to get a sense of what that blended effect will look like in 2Q?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
We didn't hear that clearly enough.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
For the securities purchases made during the quarter, just trying to get a sense of what the rate was on those
purchases to get a idea of what the blended rate in the second quarter will look like?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. So the rate that we have on average for the quarter, which you saw back down 33 basis points in the 4.60s,
that should be fairly consistent with what's been done. The purchases that were done were fairly short-term,
expect to maybe roll out of some of that and keeps maybe more at the Federal Reserve as well. So that's
probably a little bit of a stronger profile.

David Smith Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Could you just confirm what you think your true asset sensitivity is today, the 10-K said that 100 basis point higher
shock would boost NII by 3%. And I thought I heard you saying earlier that the NII guide is towards the high end,
but the better loan growth is being offset by there being two fewer cuts in the model which would imply liability
sensitivity. So if you could just expand on that. I know that NII is just one piece for you with the deposit costs and
the mortgage income benefiting from the lower rates, but just strictly for the NII, like how you view the impact of
the higher or lower Fed today?

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2024
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Correct. I mean, NII is going to be increasing in a higher rate environment. And you saw that a little bit
here, even though it looks stable environment. We did have a bit of a slope upward in yield as net interest income
was up $7 million. What's changed though is that we're really looking more at what we call earnings at risk. So it
considers the NII, it considers the ECR, and then it also considers what might happen in the AmeriHome context.
And if I put all those together, we would prefer a lower rate environment rather than higher because of kind of the
additional leverage pickup we would get in AmeriHome in particular. But yes, NII solely would still increase in a
rising rate environment and decline in the lower rate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Smith Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Okay. And then just in terms of the NII guide staying the same, although maybe moving to the higher end of the
range, how that works with there being fewer cuts and the better outlook for loan growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. I mean, it's up. Yeah. I mean, fewer rate cuts that results in a higher number, because we're not going to
get the compression on the way down. And then, kind of the volume element, we've kind of talked about as we
deploy, the $7 billion in deposits that we got in Q1 and what were the additional of these $4 billion that we're
looking for, for the rest of the year, into at least on a prospective basis, into higher yielding assets rather than into
kind of short-term securities that satisfy high quality liquid asset requirements.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
It will build quarter-to-quarter with a slight improvement in Q2 as we put the loans out, and then it begins to grow
stronger in Q3 and Q4.

quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

higher volumes.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. We look for it to increase because the marginal spread that we're going to pick up between deposits and

Thanks. Good morning. I had another follow-up on the credit side of things. If I look at the total classified increase,
a little over $100 million in the quarter, the investor CRE side, inclusive of lower hotel and increase in office was
basically flat. But the delta was a little more on the C&I side. So I just wonder if you could comment about within
the C&I book what you're experiencing there, were any particular business lines that were weaker and got more
movement this quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A

Sure. Thanks. Tim again. Okay. Our portfolio remains stable. We remain vigilant in this elevated interest rate
environment. But we're really seeing stable performance across all the segments outside of the more pronounced
movements that we've talked about in office. Really any other movements that we see are idiosyncratic and
related to a specific business, not a trend in a portfolio.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2024
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
What I mean is that – so the mortgage warehouse deposits primarily come from two sources. One is principal and
interest, and those are on a monthly cycle as we get fixed funds in from mortgage payments and then we remit
them to the GSEs some three weeks later. And so, you get this kind of intra-month kind of sinewave.
Regarding the taxes and insurance though, that's a longer cycle. And particularly, I think taxes are usually
semiannual, some are annual. And so, we have a dip from tax payments, property taxes in those deposits, and it's
very pronounced in the fourth quarter. That's what really drove that number lower from where we were at
September 30th. And so, we say re-acquired in terms of those. Those funds are then depleted as they are paid
through the taxing agency and then they start building up again and they build up quickly. And frankly, we brought
in some other clients there too which kind of helped to boost it up because normally it wouldn't have recovered
quite that quickly. You'd have to be in the second quarter to do it. But that didn't happen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
What was announced in Q4 came back in Q1, Jon, a little stronger than we thought, because we had some
market share wins at the end of last year that began to finance, fund up in Q1. And that's what Dale means.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. Thanks on that. It's just bigger than I thought. And that helps me understand that. Ken, you
mentioned very early in your prepared comments an upper teen return on tangible is your goal. How do you view
the sustainability of that? I mean, if you can do that, the stock goes up. But is that the key metric you look at? And
what do you think about sustainability of that longer-term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Yeah. Well, we wouldn't have put it in there if we didn't think that we had a high confidence level of getting there.
It'll build up through 2024. And again, everything we talked about on the last earnings call and this one is about
the earnings exit or velocity rate out of 2024 into 2025. Now that return could actually spike up in the event that
the Fed does take some more actions and reduces rates and then you'll see a greater share of fee income come
from AmeriHome. Right now, we kind of have that at a basic steady state of where it is today. But rates come
down, say 100 basis points over the next four quarters or whatever, you can see AmeriHome really gearing up
and producing far more income and generating a higher return on equity for the entire company.

Erik Zwick Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Good morning, everyone. A quick follow-up question, maybe kind of a multipart question regarding your loans that
are secured by real estate collateral. First, I'm just curious, how often are the individual property valuations
refreshed and what percentage of your portfolio has received updated valuations, say, in the past six months?
And the reason I guess I'm asking is that CRE transaction volume has in certain markets has been somewhat
muted in recent quarters, and that can potentially obscure or slow market recognition of changes in values in

either direction, right, up or down. But with current concerns that higher rates put pressure on values, how
comfortable are you that the valuations you're currently using and reserving against are reflective of current
market valuations?

Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
Sure. Thanks. That's a good question. I'll take it. Tim again. Okay. So a couple of things just to level set. We're a
bridge and construction lender in commercial real estate. Okay. So there isn't a scenario here where we have
term loans that we're waiting for a maturity to look at or they're benefiting from a long-term fixed rate that was put
in place in a different environment. These are floating rate loans and we value them against appraisal and
performance on an ongoing basis. All of our documentation includes terms for reappraisal and re-margin. So
those thoughts around value are critical to us and that isn't something that we wait for a default or a maturity to
handle. Additionally, we have substantial submarket data that we track to track trends in value. But in advance of
that, we're tracking the trends in submarket occupancy, so that we can really understand how that will translate to
the value in situations when there is limited market sale activity.

Hi. Just a quick follow-up on the ECRs. Dale, I know, you said that you guys are trying to get ahead of those kind
of higher cost accounts. Do you think that the beta on the ECR rate on the way down when the Fed start cutting,
do you think that could be equal to or exceed the beta that we saw on the way up?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorp.
I mean, you have to kind of segment that into what types of ECRs there are. Within the mortgage warehouse side,
yes, I think we're going to be at or near 100%, perhaps even over 100% for some time. But in total, it'll be lower
than that as we use ECRs for HOA deposits as well. But those start at a much lower rate to begin with. So I do
think that we'll be at least as fast as we were on the way up, on the way down, and maybe in some cases even a
bit better.
