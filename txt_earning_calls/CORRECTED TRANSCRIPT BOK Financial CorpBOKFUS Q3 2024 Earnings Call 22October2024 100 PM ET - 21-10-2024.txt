Q3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024
Stacy C. Kymes
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Thank you, Heather. We're pleased to report earnings of $140 million or EPS of $2.18 per diluted share for the
third quarter. As we've mentioned previously, we are a strong and growing company that has prioritized
generating attractive long-term results, and we have demonstrated that again this quarter. During the quarter, net
interest income and net interest margin have stabilized and started an upward trend, consistent with prior
expectations. We're also on track to capturing the down rate deposit base as we communicated.
The credit performance of our loan portfolio remains excellent. We had net recoveries during the quarter.
Criticized classified levels remain below normalized pre-pandemic levels, and a combined allowance that remains
robust at 1.39% of outstanding loans given our strong credit profile and performance. Loan commitments remain
stable. Although, as Marc will cover later, robust capital markets activity during the quarter impacted growth in
outstanding loan balances. We are encouraged by current sales activity and the trajectory that sets up going
forward.
Our fee income segments performed particularly well and contributed significantly to our overall results. Scott will
talk more about those details shortly, but I wanted to note that we are proud of surpassing the $110 billion mark
for assets under management or administration for the first time in our history. These results were achieved while
preserving strong levels of liquidity with continued growth in our deposit portfolio, showcasing the strength of our
franchise. We remain well-positioned for growth while maintaining regulatory and tangible capital levels that are
attractive versus peers.
Our performance is reflective of solid operational execution and the strength of the economic conditions in our
markets. We remain focused on delivering value to our customers and shareholders. During the quarter, we also
saw the first cut in rates from the Federal Reserve and I'm happy with the proactive steps our team is working
through to adapt quickly to this change. Marty will discuss this in more detail later. It's also important to consider
that for the first time in more than two years, the yield curve is no longer inverted as of the end of the quarter.
While we may be neutral to the level of rates, there is certainly upside to our operating model when the yield
curve is normal and upward sloping. This bodes well for us moving forward.
I'm pleased with the results the BOKF team produced this quarter and I'm optimistic about the trajectory our team
has established. The economic backdrop we're operating in should allow us to continue generating attractive
returns moving forward.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Marc.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun
Executive Vice President-Regional Banks, BOK Financial Corp.
Thanks, Stacy. Turning to slide 7, overall period end loans decreased 2.3%, linked quarter with commercial loans
down 4.8% and CRE up 2.1%. However, average loan balances contracted only $80 million or 0.3%. Despite the
slight pullback in outstandings this quarter, we continue to grow new commitments and relationships. If you look
at core C&I, which is reflective of our general business and services, outstandings in those segments increased in
a 6.4% year-over-year rate and total commitments have grown at a 5.7% year-over-year rate.
BOK Financial experienced 11 consecutive quarters of loan growth until the third quarter. While the unique nature
of the markets in the specialty lending areas impacted this consistent loan growth this quarter, we remain
optimistic about our loan growth for future periods. Portfolio yields increased 6 basis points during the quarter.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024
The majority of that increase was due to growth in loan fees, which I will break down in more detail as we walk
through our loan segments.
Loan balances in the energy business decreased 9.4% linked quarter. Most of this was driven by broader trends
and the public debt market appetite for this sector. In Q3, we saw a more accommodating bond market with
issuance in domestic energy debt transactions increasing significantly on a linked quarter basis. This activity does
reduce outstanding loan balances. However, we have the ability to capture some of the bond economics of these
transactions, which are accretive to earnings and led to a quarterly record in our investment banking revenue. We
realized additional early payoff fees which contributed to the yield increase I noted previously.
Further, energy balances this quarter were affected by M&A activity with the acquisition of several of our
customers resulting in the payoff of their loans. In many cases, we also participate and/or lead the credit facilities
of the acquiring institutions, but are seeing lower levels of leverage after the business combination. This has
contributed to utilization rates in energy falling from 45% to 42% during the quarter. We've grown energy
commitments over the last several years, but temporary factors can moderate growth in outstandings in any given
period.
Our combined general business and service loans fell 4.3% linked quarter, which has given back some of the
seasonal advances that were outlined last quarter. Looking more broadly, these segments are continuing to post
strong growth, being up 6.4% on a year-over-year basis with loan pipelines remaining stable. Our healthcare
business loans decreased 1.9% linked quarter. Payoffs increased as longer term rates and spreads made it
attractive for some borrowers to refinance in the fixed rate HUD market. Our pipeline remains robust, driven by
potential new acquisition activity. Our CRE business increased 2.1% quarter-over-quarter.
As we've discussed previously, we were very close to our concentration limit several quarters ago. As paydowns
have reduced CRE levels, we are gathering new commitments and rebuilding outstandings as new loans fund up
during the construction phase of these projects. We are committed to our strict concentration limit, which is 185%
of Tier 1 capital and reserves on a committed basis, but is currently at 157%, which gives us plenty of room for
growth that should continue to build over time.
I won't cover slide 8 in detail, but this remains a good testament to the attractive long-term performance of our
credit. Transitioning to slide 9, credit quality remains exceptional across the loan portfolio, extending our trend of
outperformance versus peers in this area. NPAs, not guaranteed by the US government, fell again this quarter,
decreasing $6 million. The resulting non-performing assets to period end loans and repossessed assets
decreased 1 basis point to 34 basis points.
Committed criticized assets remain very low relative to historical standards. Further, we had net recoveries of
$54,000 during the quarter and net charge-offs have averaged seven basis points over the last 12 months.
Looking forward, we expect net charge-offs to remain below historical norms. We are well reserved with a
combined allowance for credit losses of $332 million or 1.39% of outstanding loans.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Scott.

Scott Bradley Grauer
Executive Vice President-Wealth Management & Chief Executive Officer-BOK Financial Securities, Inc., BOK Financial Corp.
Thank you, Marc. Turning to our operating results for the quarter, total fee income grew $2.5 million, contributing
$202.5 million of revenue and representing 40% of total revenue, which continues to differentiate us from our
peers and represents another strong contribution from these lines of business.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024
I'd like to begin by covering our markets and securities businesses on slide 11. Both our trading and mortgage
banking businesses can be volatile and fluctuate significantly in any given quarter based on current market
conditions and expectations from the markets, but have shown very positive risk adjusted returns. Consistent with
the industry trends, our trading fees decreased 14.6% to $23.6 million during the quarter, which was driven by
lower MBS volumes as client demand ahead of anticipated rate cuts was relatively muted.
This is partially offset by strong activity in the municipal sector. Our trading volumes and spreads are greatly
influenced by the mortgage origination market. While showing improvement compared to 2023, industry mortgage
origination volumes remained significantly below historical norms. Given the recent rate cut and anticipated cuts
ahead, we expect those volumes to continue to return to more normal levels which aligns with the current industry
viewpoint. On that topic, mortgage banking revenue has remained relatively unchanged for the past three
quarters, coming in at $18.4 million for the third quarter.
The mortgage origination market remains relatively soft. As origination volumes increase and the environment
normalizes, both trading revenues and mortgage banking revenues should be positively impacted. While we face
some headwinds in this space over the past two years, we believe the outlook has improved from current levels.
Our other markets and securities businesses continue to produce solid results. We recognized a record quarter
for investment banking fees, coming in at $10.8 million, led by our Texas municipal bond underwriting team and
bond economics related to the energy payoffs that Marc noted in his comments.
Turning to slide 12, asset management revenue was consistent with the second quarter at $57.4 million. Growth
in our trust fee income nearly offset last quarter's seasonal tax preparation fees. Assets under management
administration grew $3.2 billion, with increased market valuations. As Stacy mentioned in his opening
commentary, we eclipsed the $110 billion mark for the first time, and we're proud of the decades of work that have
contributed to building this platform.
Transaction card revenue grew by 4.6% to $28.5 million, driven by higher volume of transactions processed.
These businesses produce attractive peer leading returns and give us a resilience to market stresses, contributing
greatly to the strength of our franchise. They are core to our business model and were built over decades of
investment. We are thrilled with the strong financial results these teams are producing and the outlook for growth.
And now, I'll hand the call over to Marty to cover financials.

Martin E. Grunst
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Thank you, Scott. Turning to slide 14, net interest income was up $12.1 million and net interest margin was up 12
basis points with core net interest margin excluding trading up 8 basis points. Within the 8 basis points, 3 basis
points were due to unusually high loan fees in Q3, driven by the increased level of loan payoffs, which is not
expected to recur. The remaining 5 basis points are on track with the drivers we have talked about over the last
couple quarters, causing asset repricing to exceed liability repricing, including securities and fixed rate loan
repricing and less deposit mix shift out of DDA. The strong interest bearing deposit growth in Q3 also supported
both net interest margin and net interest income.
Deposit repricing activity resulting from the 50 basis point Fed rate cut is also on track with our expectations. Both
the index deposits and the high beta portions of our commercial and wealth deposit book were repriced lower in

conjunction with the Fed rate cut. These actions were largely completed by quarter end and give us a high degree
of confidence that we will realize our deposit beta expectations as market rates decline.
Overall, deposit betas on the way down should be similar in magnitude debated on the way up. If we see
continued interest bearing deposit growth in Q4, that may impact the calculated deposit beta a bit, but not the
liability beta as that growth would replace wholesale borrowings and be incrementally beneficial to margin and NII.
Turning to slide 15, linked quarter total expenses increased $4.3 million or 1.3%. Personnel expenses grew $15.7
million, largely driven by incentive compensation expense, which is primarily timing related. Looking at the
average of the last two quarters, personnel expense may be useful. That increase was offset by lower non-
personnel expenses, which included a decrease related to the $13.6 million charitable contribution made to the
BOKF Foundation in the second quarter.
Slide 16 provides our view on full year 2024, and I will note a couple of changes. Loan growth expectations were
revised to reflect this quarter's specialized lending payoff activity that Marc covered in his commentary. Deposit
growth has remained strong, with new balances being added below the cost of wholesale borrowings. We expect
net interest income to be slightly higher than $1.2 billion. Fees and commissions were adjusted to reflect recent
and current conditions in MBS trading, and provision expense was also adjusted to reflect the very strong credit
quality results we continue to experience. We are in the midst of our budgeting process for next year, so
consistent with our normal practice, we will provide 2025 guidance when we announce Q4 results in January.
With that, I would like to hand the call back to the operator for Q&A, which will be followed by closing remarks
from Stacy.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes
from the line of Michael Rose with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe I could just start on some of the loan
payoff commentary. Certainly understand some of the specialized segments in energy. But when I look at the kind
of the market breakdown, it looks like you experienced declines in even some of the smaller markets that you
guys are in. So, I know you talked positively about future loan growth pipelines being full. Can you just give us
some color there as to maybe what pipelines look like now versus a quarter, couple of quarters ago? And do you
think some of the headwinds around the election will actually cause people to actually borrow? Just some color
there would be great. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banks, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, I'll take the last part first. It's Marc. I'll just say that, obviously uncertainty will cause people to delay decisions
so it's likely that some of those decisions will be resolved by the election or views on tax policy going forward in
the short-term. But we do expect that, that will have an impact later this year. But we're looking at our pipelines
overall. We feel pretty strongly that in the C&I world that our pipelines are in good shape. Fundamentally, we're
looking at the C&I portfolio that, as we said in the second quarter, we were at a seasonal high during that quarter.

And then, we have seen that come down in the third quarter in line with what our pattern has been in the past.
This is not an unusual development. But if we look at the – that's why we concentrate on year-over-year growth.
And so, we had 6.4% in year-over-year growth in C&I and 5.7% growth in commitments and utilization is only
down from 57% to 56%. So the pattern has existed, but we actually have raised the overall level of our
commercial and industrial loan throughout the year, not just looking at third quarter to second quarter. So, I would
say when we then look at our experience in the smaller markets, all the different markets, we've been very
actively acquiring talent in those markets and we've been actively increasing our calling and pursuing business
because we are in good position from a capital standpoint, from a credit standpoint to pursue business. And we
feel comfortable that barring any significant change in the economy, that we're going to be able to generate future
loan growth and we're in a good position going forward with that over the next 12 months or plus.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Michael, this is Stacy. Just to pile on, I think, we've had 11 consecutive quarters of loan growth. And so, you had a
really unique circumstance this quarter around energy and healthcare that impacted the totals overall. You've got
lots of tailwind, I think, as we look into the next 18 months around commercial real estate, because we were well
below our concentration limits, and so we've got room to find out there. We've got really good – we track [ph]
through sales force (00:19:04), we track our pipelines monthly, quarterly, everything we're looking at there still
feels very good to us.
Marc is right, there can be some uncertainty that happens around election season or next year. You think about
tax policy. But if you just look on the surface, those core C&I areas are growing 6% year-over-year. We're really
happy with that. We strung together up until this quarter 11 consecutive quarters of loan growth. We still feel
confident. There's nothing here inherently that's changed our confidence in our ability to grow the portfolio. In fact,
we're continuing to add significant talent, some of which we haven't even announced yet in some of our markets.
So we're confident that we'll continue to grow loans as we move forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Very helpful. Thanks for that. And maybe just one for Scott. Certainly understand some of the near-term
headwinds as it relates to maybe mortgage banking and some of the brokerage trading softness, at least
sequentially this quarter. But it sounds like the outlook and what you guys are trying to put forward is relatively
positive. What do you see as kind of the greatest opportunities among fees as we think about the next couple of
quarters and where could there still be some headwinds? And maybe, how would the impact of lower rates,
meaning, if we get more cuts in the forward curve or maybe less in the forward curve, how would that, in your
view, impact some of the fee lines business? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Bradley Grauer A
Executive Vice President-Wealth Management & Chief Executive Officer-BOK Financial Securities, Inc., BOK Financial Corp.
Right. So, great question. I think that when you look in detail at the trading line item, it is entirely limited to the
mortgage backed securities sector where we've seen significant headwinds. And so, when you parse that out and
eliminate the MBS, we actually saw increases in all of our other product set. So municipals, corporates,
treasuries, all of our fixed income activity was actually up, absent the MBS.
So, we did and have seen, beginning in mid-September with the Fed move, we have seen an uptick in the activity
on the MBS side, and the question that remains is the degree to which we'll see continued momentum in activity.

But we have seen an inflection point in terms of the activity in the volumes there on even the MBS side. But we
continue to have constructive belief about our positioning inside the municipal bond space, both from an
underwriting and a trading perspective. On the asset management side, we've got consistent sources of inflows to
offset our general churn in our assets with disbursements, etcetera. So we like our allocation of our assets in
terms of our AUMA with 13% in cash, 40% fixed income, 39% equities and 8% alternatives. So we're well
balanced. And I think poised to continue to benefit in asset growth from the market perspective, but probably
more significantly, more importantly on our flows in on our asset management side. So we're constructive on all of
those and continue to see positive trends develop really across the board on those basis.
And then, I think, Marty, you want to comment a little bit on mortgage production?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. Michael. So I'd say, mortgage production, we feel like there's good opportunity in the future there. I mean,
current period production levels are still a little depressed. But I think as time moves forward and we see the rate
declines continue, we'll see both volume come back up and gain on sale production. That percentage was a little
bit lower Q3, I think you'll see it go back to more like what you saw in Q2. So I think that there's opportunity in that
line item as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
But there's no doubt there's pressure there. I think if you think about other areas we've got, like, Mike, we don't
talk about our ATM business, TransFund, our transaction card business up 4.6%, very steady. And these guys
have really turned the growth corner. I'm excited about kind of where they're headed over the next 12 to 18
months from their perspective. They went through a really difficult system conversion a couple of years ago and
really kind of got through that mess and have turned the corner in a meaningful way there.
Our businesses aren't all designed to go up and to the right. And so some of these businesses like the trading
was impacted by MBS or the mortgage businesses are going to be softer when others are performing very well. I
mean, Scott mentioned the fiduciary business. I mean, $110 billion of assets under management, lots of tailwind
from the markets today. We're awfully excited about the opportunities there over the next year or so. So it's not all
going to go in tandem together as it goes up into the right. But the mix is very good and we like how it all works
together over different cycles.

Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yes. Marty, clarification question for you on expenses. You expect the incentive comp number to come back
down in 4Q to kind of a more normalized level, I guess, and I think you said the average of last two quarters is a
run rate for comp. Is that Q1 and Q2 or Q2 and Q3?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, Jon, if you look at Q2 at $191 million for personnel expense, that's low versus kind of a run rate level in Q3
at $206.8 million, that's high. I mean, the easy way to do it is to just average those two. And that gives you much
better sense for kind of what our run rate is for that line item. There's just – the way you have to recognize
incentive comp, that's not always – sometimes there's a little noise quarter-to-quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. Thank you on that. Then on deposits, slide 5. You guys had – you're talking about almost $1 billion in
growth for the quarter. Curious where you're finding the opportunities to grow deposits in general. Is this client
movement or is it market share gains, or what's driving that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, it's more commercial and wealth broadly, but a little bit more skewed towards commercial. And it's a
combination of new clients we're bringing to the bank, probably a little bit more of that is existing clients, but it's
broad based across the business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banks, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. Jon, some of that is mix change. We have customers that are moving from DDA and they're taking
advantage of the opportunity and moving in it. We're not losing them as deposits, we're just changing the mix from
a DDA to more of a interest bearing option.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banks, BOK Financial Corp.
We have, I would say, we have added a number of new customers over this last 18-month period.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. And just back on the specialty businesses and energy growth or energy pressures in terms of
balances, what do you think changes that? Is it just as simple as the bond market is open and there's M&A
happening there? What changes some of those heavy payoffs in those businesses? Thanks.

Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
This is Stacy. I mean, there's a lot that could change. I don't think that – what happened in the third quarter I think
is unique for energy. And we just had a bunch that kind of coincidentally all happened at the same time. It tends to
be a little bit more ratable over these type of periods. I think if you look just today, which doesn't mean that's the
way it'll end at the end of the year, but energy is up relatively materially from where it was at the end of
September. That could change. But I don't think there's some fundamental shift here that's happening with energy
that there's going to continue to be pressure on balances.
I think that there may still be some leftover capital markets activity or M&A activity that could get impact the
balances for a quarter or two here. But I think the bulk of that should be behind us, and I would expect those
balances to grow as we move forward, particularly over the next – if you think about – when I think about things
over kind of the [ph] 12 to 15 months (00:28:01) or longer time horizon, I think you'll see those balances grow from
the end of the third quarter over the next 12 months, for sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banks, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. And I would only add that clearly this is one of the more stable markets we've had in a long, long time. I
mean, it's been consistently good pricing in the oil market and customers are going to still have to invest in order
to maintain their borrowing bases and continue their production and so forth. So we do expect – and we've been
in this business a long time and we'll get our share of those opportunities as they come about.

Yeah, Peter, I'd say couple of things. So, efficiency is super important to us. We're always looking to manage to
appropriate efficiency ratios at each line. That's more important at the line of business level than all rolled up
actually as we think about it. And those numbers will move around just as margin moves around. But you're right,
expense growth is something that we pay attention to and want to make sure that every line of business is doing
so in a prudent way.
However, we are also very focused on investing in our business and growing our business. And so that takes the
form of adding producers and adding technological capability to serve customers. And so you'll see that in a
couple of line items. So, we feel good about what we've delivered this year. But I'll just note that data processing
and communications, we've got investments that are really good investments for long-term growth for the

company. And so, what you saw just looking at this quarter, for example, that's a couple [indiscernible] (00:30:14)
line of business that have grown really well and we're very excited about what that means for the company.
But you'll see that step up and that's not going to come back, to be sure. And then as we add people, you'll see,
occupancy is a step function for growth in people, and so you'll see that come up over time if that's part of what
your question was.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
But Peter, if you look at the overall efficiency, I mean, I think, to be where we are with the rate environment where
it's been, looking at it by line of business, we feel really good about kind of managing from an efficient
perspective. I think you'll see us make some investments here, and I think you'll see us work really hard to
maintain the efficiency ratio where we're at today. But I also think that you've got a couple of businesses that are
not funding, not operating at a high revenue level where they've been in the past that drag that efficiency a little
bit. And so, we like those businesses. They help us through a long cycle, but they do impact it. And so, we're not
too worried about that. But like Marty said, it's more important for us to look at it at a line of business level. And
we're very comfortable with our efficiency when we look at it through that lens.

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. And then if I can ask, the deposit growth, as I think Jon mentioned, was very strong. It's been very strong.
It's been outpacing the loan growth. So with the loan to deposit ratio just 64%, are there opportunities maybe to
push down deposit costs more aggressively than you thought maybe a quarter ago? And is there kind of a certain
level you don't want to see that loan to deposit ratio go above?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, we're not managing to a loan to deposit ratio per se. But you're right, having a loan to deposit ratio as we
do does give us the ability to manage deposits very well. And so, what we did in the third quarter, we're very
happy about the progress we made in being able to bring down deposit rates as a result of the Fed move. And got
a good bit of that done before the end of the quarter. We're still a little bit more or less to go. And all of that gives
us the confidence that we're going to continue to expand margin as we go from Q3 into Q4. And that's a
sustainable trend for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
And that expansion on the margin, that's on a core 5 basis points, right, not the recorded?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
I think you'll see that in both as we go from Q3 to Q4.

So even above the 2.68%.

Peter J. Winter Q

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin with Hovde Group. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Hey, good afternoon. Wanted just to follow up on that 2.68% and talk about the margin from here. And I know you
had – I believe it was 3 basis points due to payoffs and core expansion of 8 basis points. Can you talk maybe a
little bit more about the drivers that you expect in 4Q? And then it sounded like you were pretty comfortable with
deposit betas. I just wanted to dive in a little bit more on your lowering deposit rates post that first Fed cut.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Sure. Yeah. So keep in mind that, SOFR actually – term SOFR actually had a rate cut in it by September 1. I
mean, it was 15 basis points down from where it was early on. So we actually saw some impact in the loan book
in September. And then we were able to get both wholesale and deposits down through the end of the quarter,
and still ended up with really good results at the end of the quarter. And so that only gets a little bit better when
you get into the fourth quarter. So those repricing dynamics, we understand very well and are very comfortable
with how that plays through. There's always some denominator effects that can happen if overall trading moves
around. But we feel very confident about how that will play out over the next – for the next quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Brett, we talked a lot about the loan and deposit book, but don't forget, we've got a fixed rate security portfolio
that's got a 3.5 year plus or minus duration that's funded with floating rate liabilities that's going to move down
commensurate with every [indiscernible] (00:35:07). And so that's part of what's behind the confidence of what's
going to happen with net interest margin and interest income.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
So everything I just talked about is still on top of the – fixed rate securities are still repricing up, a portion of the
fixed rate loan book, that's still repricing up. That stuff's still happening as it has for the last couple of quarters. So
that will continue to be supportive.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then the other thing was just, I'm curious, I think people kind of view you guys as very
selective M&A players and maybe there'd be some others that might be more aggressive than you. And I'm just

curious to hear your thoughts on what you see playing out in the environment, conversations, what you're seeing
activity wise or maybe chatter wise with some of your potential partners?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, just I mean, just broadly, I think that we're interested in the right opportunity, it's just that those have been
difficult to find. We're not interested in somebody who's got a large concentration in commercial real estate
because of our discipline there. We value core deposits, we value deposit franchises. We think those are really
key to banking, and there's just not a lot that kind of fits the size profile and exactly what we're looking for. And so,
and that remains a possibility to the extent that there's something available, but that's not how – that really we've
always viewed as kind of the cherry on top of the sundae. Our strategy isn't to buy something to achieve the next
level of growth. We're so focused on organic growth. If nothing – we're never successful of buying another bank,
we'd still think we're going to perform very well because of our emphasis on organic growth. But we're not out of
the market as it relates to things that could happen from an acquisition perspective. They're just low probability
events for which there's not a lot that really fits our criteria today.

Wood Lay Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to start on the deposit side, and more specifically, the time deposit
portfolio. Was just curious how much of that portfolio reprices in the fourth quarter. And if you could sort of walk
through the repricing dynamics there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yes, that's largely a consumer book. And so, that's got a tail that goes out well over a year, so it's not a huge
amount in any given month because it's so granular, so it's that in and of itself is not going to have a large impact
on the pricing characteristics of the deposit book.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Wood Lay Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. And then maybe just one follow-up on CRE. It sounds like CRE activity is picking up a little bit and you
have a clear advantage relative to competitors just given the concentration levels. Could you give us some color
on what you're seeing in terms of the loan competition in the space?

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2024
Yeah, I think there's a little less competition, but there's a lot of – there's also a few deals. I mean, some of those
customers that we've been with for a long time are moving more cautiously and slowly, so that's impacting that a
little bit. But clearly, there is some advantage that we have by being able to begin the market when others are still
trying to manage their concentration levels. But that's part of why we're confident that we'll – we've never had
trouble filling that bucket. And so we'll continue to prospect and to grow existing customers principally, with an
occasional new customer mixed in there. But I'm confident that over the next 12 to 18 months, we'll refill that
bucket. That's never been an issue that we're worried about growing.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Matt Olney with Stephens. Please
go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah, thanks for taking the question, guys. Just wanted to go back on the investment securities portfolio. Marty, I
think you mentioned this is still pricing higher the near-term. Any more details there as far as the cash flows in that
portfolio? And then, what you've been buying more recently, and then just the overall size of that portfolio, any
plans to change the size of that? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Sure. Yeah, we saw about $760 million of cash flow come in this quarter and reprice. And so, that repriced up
about 115 basis points during the quarter. And kind of that level is about where you can expect that over the – in
Q3, it's a little bit higher, kind of more like $650 million a month – sorry, a quarter, per quarter over the next year is
probably a good run rate to think about how much of that happens going forward. And in terms of what we're
buying, I mean, it's very similar to what we bought in the past sort of three, four year duration paper that is kind of
at the shorter end of the mortgage securities spectrum.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Got it. Thanks for that, Marty. And then, I guess I know some of the movements on the balance sheet at
quarter end can be a little bit noisy, but I guess the borrowing position came down pretty hard at September 30
below $5 billion. Is that a good assumption for the fourth quarter? Or do you have any color on that line for 4Q?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yes, you got two things going on there that brought that down at the end. So number one, that deposit growth that
we had during the quarter, I mean, that was the big driver. And so that should be durable. And then second, just
our trading account is always up in the middle of the month and then lower at the end of the month just because
that's how the mortgage backed securities settlements, that cycle works. So that will usually be a little bit lower
end of month than average. But big driver there is the deposits. So that may stay. That should grow – you should
see loan growth, and so the wholesale up a little bit over time as a trend, but I'd say that that's materially a good
starting place.

Thank you, everyone, for joining our discussion today. Again, this quarter, we maintained consistent earnings
growth, benefiting from the net interest margin expansion and exceptional asset quality. We've proven over long
history that we have both strong risk management practices as it relates to credit, interest rate, liquidity and
capital, while also demonstrating a higher long-term earnings profile. Our diverse business model has proven
resilient through many business cycles. We believe the economic resiliency of our eight-state footprint, coupled
