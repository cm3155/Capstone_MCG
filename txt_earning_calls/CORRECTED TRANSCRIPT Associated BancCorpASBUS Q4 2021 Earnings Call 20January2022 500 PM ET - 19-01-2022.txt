Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
Andrew J. Harmening
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, thank you, Hillary, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our year-end earnings call. I'm Andy
Harmening, and I'm joined today by Chris Niles, our Chief Financial Officer; and Pat Ahem, our Chief Credit
Officer. I'd like to start things off by briefly reflecting on 2021, covering the highlights for the fourth quarter and
giving you the most recent and giving you the most recent update on the strategic initiatives we rolled out in
September. From there, Chris will walk you through an update on interest income, fees and expenses and Pat will
run us out with an update on credit.
In many ways, 2021 was an inflection point for Associated Banc. We enjoyed consistent deposit growth,
improving credit dynamics and stabilization in our loan book. And importantly, we began to accelerate growth in
several core and new lending categories. More recently, we continue to see signs of a strengthening economy. In
the fourth quarter, unemployment rates in Wisconsin and Minnesota came down below 3.5%. The manufacturing
expansion we saw emerge in Q3 has maintained strong momentum which is being reflected in increasing
commercial pipelines and in utilization rates. Customers remain resilient, credit continues to improve, and we feel
well-positioned to build on our momentum in 2022.
Now, let me touch on our fourth quarter highlights as outlined in slide 2. This quarter is marked by a significant
expansion in our balance sheet. Notably, we saw meaningful loan growth as Commercial loan outstandings, line
utilization, and our new initiatives all kicked into gear. We saw $600 million in loan growth for Q4 which equates to
10% annualized growth in in terms of loans even as we intentionally shrank our PPP and our oil and gas portfolios
each by more than half. On the liability side, core low cost deposits continue to grow. And as promised, we began
building our investment securities book to put our excess liquidity to work.
Taken together, these factors contributed to expanding margins, growing net interest income, and total higher
revenues for the quarter.
Turning to credit, our customers continued to prove their resiliency as markets recovered throughout the year.
After posting reserve releases in each of the first three quarters of 2021, we posted another negative provision in
the fourth quarter and a further net reserve release. Our CECL reserves remain appropriate for our risk profile, but
as we grow into next year, we expect to add to our provision in accordance with our loan growth.
From an operating expense perspective, discipline continues to be our foundational focus for Associated. Our full-
year non-interest expense was down year-over-year while our fourth quarter expense ticked up by only 2%
despite the rollout of several new initiatives and an increase in our minimum wage. During the fourth quarter, we
also repurchased $25 million of common stock. Taken together, all of these factors helped us drive full-year EPS
to $2.18 and position us well going into 2022.
Now, let's shift to slide 3. I'd like to provide a little more detail on the trends we saw in our loan book in the fourth
quarter. In mid-2021, we started to see some encouraging signals of increased commercial activity in line
utilization, and this is now beginning to translate into meaningful growth in our commercial balances. In Q4, our
total commercial book, and that is commercial and business lending and commercial real estate combined, grew
by nearly $500 million, which is more than a 13% annualized growth rate from the third quarter. While several of
our specialty businesses added balances during the quarter, importantly, general Commercial loans were the
driving force behind this growth.
Additionally, we're still in the early stages of our new commercial initiatives but our expanded asset-based lending
team has already started to bear fruit and our Equipment Finance team is not far behind.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
On the consumer side, the new Auto Finance initiative we launched on September 30 is off to a very strong start,
adding nearly $140 million of high quality Auto loans to our books. We have now booked over 4,500 loans, and as
mortgage activities moderate, these new Auto loans will allow us to further diversify our portfolio while earning
slightly better spreads.
Following up on a strong Q3, we also saw credit card balances increase by another 6% quarter-over-quarter,
which continue to suggest that confidence is growing among our retail customer base. And during the quarter, we
took advantage of a positive economic background to export the majority of our remaining oil and gas book at
minimum cost. Our PPP balances also continue to pay down as expected throughout the quarter. And at year-
end, our oil and gas outstandings were just $52 million and our remaining PPP portfolio was down to $66 million.
And in January, we realized an additional oil and gas payoff that will bring our remaining oil and gas portfolio to
approximately $30 million. With these runoff portfolios worked down, we are squarely focused on driving growth in
our general commercial and initiative portfolios in 2022.
Turning to slide 4, we highlight our annual loan trends for 2021. And as you can see, total end of period loan
balances are down slightly year-over-year, but that was largely driven by intentional reductions in our oil and gas
exposures, runoff of PPP, and some declining mortgage balances. These reductions were largely offset by strong
growth in general commercial and other commercial specialty verticals, giving us a very strong base to build on in
2022.
On slide 5, we've highlighted a couple of additional metrics that give us optimism as we turn the page going into
2022. In Q4, growth in commercial balances was once again supported by a steady monthly uptick in line
utilization. Commercial line utilization numbers continue to close the gap relative to our historic levels. In April of
2021, we hit a low point in utilization with regional commercial customers funding 12 percentage points below our
historic line utilization. From that point, the monthly gap has continued to narrow, and in December, the gap
closed to 5 percentage points.
Line utilization increases during Q4 drove about $125 million of the Commercial loan balance growth. Additionally,
our commercial real estate team has steadily grown construction lending exposures on a quarterly basis, and in
the fourth quarter, exposures grew 5% from Q3.
Given seasonality and our substantial back book, we remain confident outstandings will continue to grow well into
2022, especially once the ground thaws in the Upper Midwest footprint. As we look to 2022, we remain bullish
around loan growth. Specifically, we now expect full year Auto Finance loan growth of over $1.2 billion and total
Commercial loan growth of $750 million to $1 billion.
Turning to slide 6. Let me give you an update on our initiatives. When we talked back in the fall, we laid out a
multiyear balanced target for our new initiatives. And while we're still in the initial phases of the plan, I'm very
pleased with the progress so far. I've already talked about total commercial and the reasons I'm excited about the
broader segment but we thought it's important to show a breakout of asset-based lending and Equipment Finance
so you can more clearly see progress in those verticals going forward.
What you see here so far through year-end is mostly ABL balances. And while we have some ABL loans on the
books historically, the team has already made meaningful progress quarter-over-quarter. Now that Equipment
Finance is up and running in Q1, I'm confident both teams are working towards the targets we've set as we move
through 2022.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
On the auto side, the team is off to a very strong start. But we've been very thoughtful about steadily ramping up
the program over time to ensure effective execution. Production is now eclipsing $4 million per business day, and
we expect this portfolio to grow more quickly as we roll out the program to our broader dealer network and into
our core footprint states over the course of 2022.
Turning to slide 7. We've highlighted some of the additional steps we've taken to make headway against the four
pillars of our strategic plan. In the Auto Finance businesses, we've stuck largely to prime and super prime space
with average FICOs north of 750 and 82% average LTVs on the loans we booked in the fourth quarter.
Additionally, we've officially began closing new ABL deals in November of 2021 and are currently building an
active Equipment Finance pipeline while rounding out our full lending team.
As we look to augment the growth in our core businesses, we've continued to ramp up our staff in our commercial
and small business segments and we also established a new commercial real estate office in Houston, allowing
controlled expansion in the great state of Texas. On the digital front, we're on track to pilot our consumer digital
bank platform in the second quarter of the year, bringing increased flexibility and architecture that will more easily
allow us to integrate fintech partners to improve the user experience.
And as always, we continue to seek ways to efficiently deploy our capital. While we see plenty of balance sheet
growth in our outlooks, should that not materialize? We also have $80 million in remaining repurchase flexibility
available to optimize our capital position.
In summary, our initiatives are in full swing, and we look forward to building on this momentum as we head into
2022. Let me pause there and hand over to Chris Niles, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide a little more detail
on our revenue and income statement trends for the quarter. Chris?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Thanks, Andy. Turning to slide 8, our net interest income increased $3 million from the prior quarter or nearly 2%,
driven by higher net interest income across most major segments and lower funding and time deposit costs. Our
quarterly net interest margin continue to move higher after having bottomed out in Q2. We continue to see a
steady decline in liability costs and expect asset yields to continue to move higher as we move through 2022.
Our nearly $16 billion of Commercial and Commercial Real Estate portfolios have historically been primarily
floating rate, LIBOR, and prime-based portfolios. Over 90% of those Commercial loans will mature, reprice, or
reset within the next year. Relative to our mid-cap banking peers, we have a higher percentage of near-term
repricing earning assets and more capacity to grow our investment portfolio so we believe we're at the upper end
of the asset sensitivity range as we look into 2022.
We have already seen our margin stabilize and begin to move higher and every major lending category is poised
to benefit from our rising rate outlook. This puts Associated in a solid position to capitalize on the expecting rise in
rate environment in 2022. Given our expectations for at least two rate increases, we expect our full year 2022
GAAP reported net interest income to exceed $800 million.
Turning to slide 9, given the high levels of liquidity in the industry, we selectively added securities throughout Q4.
During the quarter, our average investment security balances grew by over $400 million, and our blended portfolio
yields rebounded to 1.76%. We anticipate deploying additional cash balances into the investment securities
portfolio throughout 2022. Reinvestment yields today are expected to be 2% or better and will generally be

accretive to our portfolio earnings. We expect to rebuild the investment portfolio to between 20% and 22% of total
assets by year-end 2022.
Moving to slide 10, we continue to see record average deposit levels. Average deposits were up nearly $1.7
billion in Q4 or 6% year-over-year. Notably, growth continues to be concentrated in our lowest cost deposit
categories. Our aggregated wholesale funding levels have also continued to steadily decrease over the past five
quarters and have decreased by nearly $750 million year-over-year. We expect these deposit and funding trends
to continue and our margin to continue to benefit into 2022.
On slide 11, we note Associated has shifted its lower cost deposit – a shift to lower cost deposits have been even
more pronounced when viewed on an annual basis. In 2017, our average low cost deposits represented less than
half of our total deposit base while at year-end 2021, they accounted for 68% of our year-end deposit levels.
Switching to noninterest income trends on slide 12, we note that noninterest income was essentially flat during the
fourth quarter as strong wealth and capital markets fees offset softening mortgage banking results. We also saw
modest growth in service charges, card based, and other fee-related income items. Taken together, we view
these collective trends as encouraging indicators of growing customer confidence as we continue to emerge from
the pandemic. Looking to 2022, we expect full year noninterest income to exceed $300 million for the year.
On slide 13, we highlight our expenses. The fourth quarter came in at $182 million, a $4 million increase from the
prior quarter, including $1 million of facilities-related exit costs. Our fourth quarter expenses included initiative-
related expenses and our recent announced increase to minimum wage to $17 an hour.
For the full year 2021, total noninterest expense of $710 million was within our guided full year range and down
$66 million from the prior year. I'll remind you that we executed on expense initiatives in the second half of this
year that are expected to shave about $10 million per year off of our run rate.
As we continue to roll out our strategic initiatives, we remain committed to maintaining expense discipline. Taking
all of our initiatives into consideration, we expect full year 2022 noninterest expense of between $725 million and
$740 million.
On slide 14, we have provided a walk-forward of our quarterly pre-tax pre-provision income from the third quarter
to the fourth quarter. While our pre-tax income was down from the prior quarter, our pre-tax pre-provision results
were relatively flat quarter-over-quarter and remained well above the $78 million baseline we set for you in the
second quarter.
As shown on slide 15, our tangible capital – tangible book value per share continues to grow and our quarter-
over-quarter has increased 7% to $17.87. While we have taken several steps to deploy capital in an effort to
support stronger growth and shareholder returns, Associated's regulatory capital levels also remain strong. We
will continue to target TCE levels at or above 7.5% and CET1 levels at or above 9.5%.
With that, let me hand it over to our Chief Credit Officer, Pat Ahern, to provide an update on credit.

Thanks, Chris. I'd like to start by providing an update on our allowance as shown on slide 16. We utilized the
Moody's December 2021 baseline forecast for our CECL forward-looking assumptions. Moody's baseline forecast

assumes additional fiscal support, a continuing low interest rate environment, the recent acceleration in consumer
prices to be transitory, and relatively localized COVID cases.
Following net reserve releases of $28 million, $40 million, and $32 million in the first three quarters of 2021,
respectively, we ended the year by posting a further net reserve release of $12 million in the fourth quarter. This
net release was driven by gross reductions in our allowance for several of our specialty Commercial and CRE
business units, specifically an $11 million reduction in oil and gas and another $12 million reduction in CRE.
As of December 31, our total ACLL was $320 million, down from $332 million in the prior quarter. In addition, our
ratio of reserves to loans declined to 1.32% from 1.41% during the quarter. We had previously guided that we
expect ACLL to loans to drop back down to CECL Day 1 levels by the end of 2021, and we ended the year
comfortably below that benchmark.
Turning to our quarterly credit trends presented on slide 17, most of our key credit metrics continued to improve
over the course of the quarter. Our key COVID Commercial exposures continued to decline for the quarter, led by
further declines in retail and shopping center exposures. Nonaccrual loans also decreased by 3% in Q4, and were
down 38% year-over-year.
While aggregated restructured loans and delinquencies have fluctuated throughout the year, I'm pleased to
announce they decreased 35% year-over-year. Net charge-offs also decreased by $1 million quarter-over-quarter,
and by $21 million versus Q4 of 2020. Going forward, we expect to adjust provisions to reflect changes in risk
rates, economic conditions, loan volumes, and other indications of credit quality.
With that, I will now pass it back to Andy to share some closing thoughts as we look to carry our momentum into
2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Thanks, Pat. On slide 18, we recap our full year guidance for 2022. As we look to capitalize on the economic
outlook in 2022, we are expecting strong loan growth at Associated, with full year Auto Finance loan growth of
over $1.2 billion, total Commercial loan growth of $750 million to $1 billion. And then reflecting our growth outlook
and anticipation of a rising rate environment, we expect total interest income to exceed $800 million and total
noninterest income of $300 million-plus for a grand total north of $1.1 billion. We expect to finish 2022 with
approximately $725 million to $740 million of noninterest expense.
With that, and before moving to Q&A, I'd like to say a few words about the CFO transition we also announced this
afternoon. After nearly 12 years with Associated Banc, our CFO, Chris Niles, will retire from the bank later this
year. We've engaged diversified search group and the search for successor is underway. Chris will continue in his
current position until his successor's in place to ensure a seamless and successful transition.
Chris, on behalf of the whole Associated Banc team, I want to thank you for your many contributions over the
years, first, serving as our treasurer then serving as the CFO. And on a personal note, I want to say I appreciate
you helping me get my footings at Associated Banc. Your partnership and generosity of spirit has allowed me to
get acclimated internally and externally.
I also want to emphasize that I believe we are making the CFO transition from a position of strength, especially
given our positive momentum at year-end. Our Midwest markets are robust and our 2021 performance
demonstrates we are driving revenue growth across our core business lines. And we are moving decisively to

accelerate our digital transformation. I am confident in our strategy and I'm confident in our team to continue to
deliver strong performance for our stakeholders in the years to come.
I'll now pass it over to Chris for a few words.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Thank you, Andy, for those kind words. It has been my privilege to work alongside an exceptional team over the
last decade. I could not be prouder of our collective accomplishments. As I indicated to Andy and the board, I've
been thinking about the next phase of my life for a while. In consultation with Andy, we agreed 2022 is a good
time to initiate the succession process. Retiring from Associate will allow me to attend to personal and family
interests and I'm deeply grateful for that opportunity.
With that, let's open it up for questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Our first question is from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, I guess before I get into it, Chris, enjoyed working with you
over the years [ph] and to do so (24:09) more this year and wish you the best, so...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
...first − yeah, you bet so thank you for all your help. Maybe first question for you, Chris, just − [ph] I'm sorry
(24:21) how you see the margin trajecting from this quarter's 2.40%. Kind of where do you stand with respect to
the 2.75% aspirational margin in terms of progress this year? Seems like you should get a bunch of help from
rates, so maybe just some thoughts there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So when we look back on the year, clearly, our margin results for the year were weighed down by the
excess liquidity levels that we carried over the course of the year. We estimate that probably cost us about 11
basis points in margin for the year. So absent the excess liquidity, our start point probably is somewhere north of
2.50% and we're continuing to build into positive yield accretive asset classes as we move through the course of
the year.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
So, I'd like to think that we're going to quickly move towards 2.50% and build from there. I don't expect we'll get to
2.75% this year. We didn't say we would either but we're going to make solid progress in moving [ph] that way
(25:17) in that direction.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. And then so a lot of moving parts with the change in the balance sheet mix as well as just the
higher rates. So, I guess just as a follow-up, want to confirm. You suggested that two rate hikes are sort of
embedded in the NII guide for the year. And then you have sort of an easy rule of thumb that you're using for how
much NII help you get for each 25 basis points rate hike kind of in isolation.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A

$1.5 million per month for a 25-basis point hike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
All right, perfect. That is a good one. All right, thank you very much.

Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
In terms of the outlook, was hoping you could refine or give a little more color on slide 18. The $800-plus million,
the $300-plus million, obviously it's, I bet, intentionally open-ended, but wonder if you could provide a little bit
more clarity on what would drive those meaningfully above and how meaningfully above the $1.1 billion do you
expect.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, maybe I could start that off and turn it over to Chris. This is Andy. So Chris, what I would say is we were 20
days into the new year and we had a strong end to the end of the year, which put us in a really good position. So
seeing that, where our pipelines are, what we've closed, where we started the year, we think we're very much on
track to what our mid-term, short-term targets are.
So yes, we did leave it meaningfully open-ended but what I will say is every initiative that we have is on target, not
just from hiring people but from pipeline and not just from pipeline, but from the loans that are booking. Although

that's the new RMs that we have in place, we haven't hired enough RMs at this point already to hit our
Commercial baseline in-market targets.
We are very much on target in ABL, and our expectation was our first loans in Equipment Finance would book in
the first quarter. So we feel very bullish about what our forecast is but 20 days into the year, we didn't want to
forecast the month by month flow of how we end up. Chris?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
I think...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah, understood. Thanks. Totally, I get it. In terms of the auto book, I'm interested, I know you talked about the
prime and super-prime. Can you just provide some color on where yields are coming on today? And then also,
you're expecting a lot of growth and you talked about providing for that at some degree this year. Maybe throwing
a little bit more color on that would be great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. So, as Andy mentioned, we're booking more than $4 million per business day, and that's why we have very
high confidence that we're going to get well above the sort of $1.2 billion full year growth level because we're
continuing to add more dealers and we'll continue to add more markets as we go through the year. So the
baseline is there to support the growth and we think we're going to add to it.
Second, I would note that the yields have come in essentially where we thought they would was at premium to
what we've seen in the mortgage market and higher than mortgage yields, which is what we've been targeting in
that net 3s net of the dealer discounts, etcetera. And so when you see the numbers, we'll be breaking those out in
future quarters, I suspect you'll see something that will be in a 3 handle with a varying range as we move through
the course of the year and as rates perhaps evolve with that policy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
I'll say, Chris, on top of that, as we've opened up the number of active dealers, we purposely controlled the
number of active dealers we have. So we're at about 700 active dealers and we've increased that roughly every
30 days. As we've increased the number of dealers each month, we've seen increased production each month.
We want to make sure that we're sound on the operational side. I want to make sure we're sticking to the credit
box very strictly and we have been, in fact, right on target.
So I'm pleased with what we've done so far, but we want to make sure we do this the right way. While we're at
700 active dealers today, we think we could end the year with a number well exceeding double that number. So –
and those – the dealers have been very accepting based on the long-term relationships we had hoped for and we
had hoped that they would send us strong deals in prime and super-prime and that's exactly what's occurred so
far.

Great. And then just a ticky-tack one, Chris. When in the year are you assuming the hikes and is there any
nonrecurring in that expense guide? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
I'll happily take your forecast I read on the Fed. I'm pretty sure it's probably better than ours.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
But you said at least two, I think, in your prepared remarks. Are they mid-year and end of year? I'm just trying to
get a sense of what's in the guide.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
One in the first half, one in the second. And if there's more than that, there's upside.

Operator: Our next question is from Michael Young of Truist. Please proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to start just on the mortgage portfolio. Obviously, that's been an area
that's been kind of shrinking but as rates rise, we would expect maybe payments in that area and refinances out
of that book might slow. So should we expect those volumes to become a little more stable or any other thoughts?
Are you doing anything proactively ahead of higher rates to kind of move some of that off the books?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Michael, this is Andy. That's exactly what we're expecting is stability in that book, not only stability in the mortgage
book, but we actually think a long-term trend on home equity is shifting right now as well. In fact, we see that. So
we think for the first time in a long time, home equity has a real chance to grow, so we're proactively addressing
that in the first quarter of the year.
Clearly, with the rates people locked into the first mortgage at very low rates are not going to want to refinance
that mortgage, which opens up the home equity market. As rates go up, we will start to see a decrease in the
churn of that portfolio. So when we looked at the year, our forecast was that the mortgage portfolio was going to
be fairly flat and auto would make up for that at a slightly higher margin. That has proven early on to be the case.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And on the auto book, I'm just curious. Given your history or how you guys are kind of attacking this, do you
expect that rates, as they rise in the market, that the auto book will keep pace in terms of the yield or do you think
at some point that may be a less attractive area to deploy capital versus Commercial or other areas?

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, I see the auto as one piece of a balanced approach. And so when I look at the margin being well above 3%,
we have room to come down and still hit the forecast that we've put out there. We are going to stick with prime
and super-prime period. That is our focus and has been.
Now, when I think of the balance of growth, I think of the Equipment Finance and the ABL and you can see we put
pretty modest targets out there. We booked about $67 million, I believe, in ABL, new ABL on the fourth quarter.
That's two months' worth of work and we forecasted $300 million and combined at the end of the year between
ABL and Equipment Finance. So, we think those businesses are ones that will continue to grow for us. They
make sense. We're in a manufacturing belt. The ABL is extension of our Commercial and we're expanding our
Commercial teams.
So, I expect that as we look at $750 million to $1 billion in Commercial growth this year, that will continue to be a
strategy for us to continue expand on the protocols that we have and feed those. And I think the margin, I'm
optimistic that we have room to even go down in that margin on prime and super- prime and still hit the forecasts
that we have laid out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay and one last one for me just on expenses. Just as I kind of think about mortgage and volumes kind of
coming down at a macro level, are you guys kind of shrinking the expense base there assuming that we're going
to be in a lower origination environment for longer or are you pivoting personnel into auto or just how are you kind
of thinking about that expense run rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. I think we're positioning ourselves to continue to service our customers and our markets through our
mortgage teams across the marketplace in an effective manner, recognizing that there may be more – sorry, less
volume to manage as we move through 2022. There will still be plenty of customers to service, plenty of loans to
make sure that we're doing the right thing on. So I don't think it's going to be a significant shift in our strategy but
we certainly recognize maybe less new origination volumes and fewer commissions paid as we move forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah, I think the other thing is we built flexibility in our expense base by having outsourced colleagues as well as
FTEs. So we'll monitor that closely based on volumes and the contractual nature of what we have out there. But
we've built-in the assumptions that as that goes down, the expenses of that book go down as well. They're not
necessarily transferrable resources into auto as that's a specialty vertical.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay, fair enough. And Chris, I'd be remiss if I didn't wish you congratulations and I hope you at least get to
spend a few weeks somewhere warm here near-term.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah, we're not changing our long-term outlook. We think the numbers that we're putting forward here are
consistent with that outlook. And I think you'll find that we're making steady progress retaining those long-term
goals and we feel good about those long-term goals.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Right. Others have covered the auto and margin, so the other one was anything to report on the increase in
potential problem loans? It just kind of caught my eye up, I believe, about 20% quarter-over-quarter in the
Commercial portfolio. Anything to talk about there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
No, not really. I think we had – as you know, in the portfolio, it ebbs and flows quarter to quarter. I don't think
we're seeing anything systemic there that's affecting the portfolios at large.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And then just one last question. Just want to make sure. Have all the hires been made and relationship with
dealers established to hit those loan growth targets for the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
The hiring for the auto team is largely in place, yes, that's not a significant gap and we have established dealer
relationships with about 700 today. As Andy mentioned, we'll likely more than double that as we move through the
course of this year, so there's more to come. And we haven't yet opened up our footprint states, Minnesota,
Wisconsin, Illinois in particular, which we think will be a nice source of additional growth later in the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
And what I'd say on the verticals, we have about 60% to 70% of the colleagues that we'll hire by year-end already
hired and in place. So – but what we have there today, we're on track to hit our targets.
On the Commercial side, we have roughly half of the colleagues already in place and with that, we're on track to
hit our targets. The colleagues that we bring on the rest of the year in commercial, we'll start funding our end of
year, beginning of next year target numbers as well. So we are right on pace, feel very comfortable on the hiring
front and what those hires mean from a production standpoint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
All right. Thanks, everyone.

Good afternoon, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Hi, Daniel.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Just one for me here. As we think about -- you've been asked about the revenue guide as a whole, as we think
about it just related to fee income, the $300-plus million number, kind of putting aside whatever assumptions that
are made for the mortgage banking business, is there anything within the remainder of – remaining line items that
you would expect not to grow in 2022 or are you seeing growth in those numbers? And then we can kind of put
what whatever assumption we have on the mortgage banking business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. I think broadly speaking, we're seeing positive trends in the service charges, card businesses, capital
markets, et cetera. We don't make a practice of projecting a lot of [indiscernible] (39:27) increase, and we're not
necessarily in the business of taking asset gains and losses per se. So those are the sort of the wild cards. But
generally speaking, our fee, our core fee-based revenue streams all have a nice year-end trajectory and continue
to build nicely.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
And just the wealth business is probably another one that wasn't necessarily mentioned there. We had record
production. We have a dedicated leader in that business for the first time in quite some time and that's really
brought the group together. I'm pleased with the results both on the sales and the retention that the portfolio
performance.

Daniel Tamayo Q

Operator: Our next question is from Jared Shaw of Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good afternoon. This is Timur Braziler filling in for Jared. Maybe just starting on the improved line utilization
and just the loan growth in general, maybe talk through paydown activity, kind of how that trended through the
quarter. And I'm wondering if you get a sense that any of the loan activity was pulled forward from the first quarter
of 2022? Or is this type of momentum kind of sustainable as we are now 20 days into the new quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, I think if you look at the growth which was almost $0.5 billion for the quarter, we're not calling for that to be
sustained for quarters going forward. We had really strong growth and we don't think that it was necessarily pulled
forward. I think it was really our customers stepping in to the market in a very positive way.
Payoffs were not necessarily out of line with what we've seen in prior periods but new fundings and draws were
the difference maker this quarter and they were increases. So that's what we saw both new customers, new lines
from existing customers or new additions and line utilization all contribute to those numbers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
And line utilization has been a steady number for us. We've seen it go up slightly for several months in a row. The
Auto business, I think, is a very clear line that's increased each of the last three months, and we expect that to
continue to do so. The Commercial side, as Chris said, look, we're looking for $750 million to $1 billion in growth
for the year. So it was a very strong quarter. That puts us in good shape.
But when we think about the CRE book and the numbers that we see out there on the construction side, that
really bodes well for that business as we head into the year, the commercial pipelines that we had. And keep in
mind, we haven't yet booked our first Equipment Finance loan. So we'll have Equipment Finance. We'll have
asset-based learning. We have nice growth and the opportunity in CRE. So, well, I don't expect $500 to forecast
for the quarter and we're not forecasting that. I'm pretty bullish on what we are seeing in the fourth quarter and
what that could mean for 2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's good color. Thank you. And then just one last one for me, if I can follow up on some of the Auto-
related questions, I guess the new growth is it coming from the additions of the new dealers coming online every
30 days. Is it coming from the existing dealers? And maybe talk about some concentration limits that you're going
to be putting in place once the dealer network is kind of fully built out. Concentration limits on dealer activity.

Yeah. So, clearly the team we hired came over with a very well established collection of longstanding, deep-
rooted relationships. And as part of our acquisition of intellectual property from KeyBanc, we acquired dealer
scorecards and histories as part of this. So I think we have a very good handle on the folks we're doing business
with. We have a very good handle on the type of volume, the consistency of that flow of activity, and we feel very
comfortable with what we've been doing here over the last roughly 120 days. And it's coming along at essentially
exactly what our team said it would be. So we're actually very pleased with that. And I don't see us running into
any constraints or limits for a while as we expect this to become a multibillion dollar portfolio on our balance sheet
over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
I'll also follow that up by reiterating the balanced nature of what our plan is and how much I think we have some
legs on small business. We haven't talked much about that. We're looking at $100 million increase in production
year-over-year just in small business. Our commercial businesses, as we've hired people, we've gotten the
production fairly quickly and we have an opportunity in market to grow those. The verticals that we have, we
believe, have legs for years to come. So there will be a point where that growth clearly dissipates in auto in year, I
don't know, three, four. But as we're moving towards that time, we have a path outlined and we've taken the
actions towards the beginning of both verticals, commercial and small business growth.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
If I give my usual answer, I would say, of course, I do.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Question for Chris or Pat. Just how do you want us to think about the provision? You still have pretty healthy
reserves but you did say you're below day one CECL and you obviously have a lot of growth on the horizon. Are
we at the end of the reserve releasing in negative provisions or how should we think through them?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
This is Pat. I would say from a reserve ratio, we might see that come down a little bit. Could it be in the $125
million to $130 million range? Possibly. But I think we're starting to see this quarter with growth. Some needed to
add to that provision. So I think as we get into the year, the growth that we've outlined here will kind of push that
provision in more of a build standpoint than a release.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Okay. Thank you for that. Chris, the $1.5 million per month reached 25 basis points, that's great. That's a
great way for us to think through it. How long does that relationship hold? Meaning how do you think about
deposit betas and how comfortable are you with the rate sensitivity in the deposit base?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So I think we've been very thoughtful about the sensitivity that we experienced in deposits in the last run up
and our estimate reflects that into the number that I gave you, the $1.5 million per month for 25 basis points.
Clearly, it's our expectation that liquidity levels are elevated and that there's going to be a shift somewhat
downward. I think if you asked us a year ago, we would have thought that would be a more rapid shift than we're
actually seeing. And the reality is, as I think, John, you and I have talked about in the past, the alternatives that
used to be out there for investors, whether that's that the commercial paper market, the asset-backed CP
conduits, money market alternative funds, the primary funds, money market reform really did away with a lot of
that. And so there's fewer alternatives, and we're seeing that reflected in the biggest banks pricing. And so I think
there's an opportunity here where you'll see, as we have seen in the past, a fair amount of deposit lag, but we'll
see some outflows. And so we're assuming those outflows and we're assuming some deposit lag and that's baked
into that $1.5 million per month.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Okay, fair enough. And then last question, maybe for you, Andy, you've touched on the footprint being
strong. And kind of look – I'm looking at slide 6 and slide 18 in terms of the Commercial loan growth and some of
the expectations there. How much of that do you think is just from the footprint versus some of the specialty lines
of business?

I would say that we're getting a lot of single name credits, and we're seeing it balanced out between Wisconsin,
specifically probably Milwaukee, Chicago, and Minneapolis. So I don't have the exact mix in front of me, but I will
tell you that the occurrence of single name, we can follow up on that. But the occurrence of single name credits
has been significant for us, particularly as we've added RMs in market.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A

I would throw out that we do some geographic reporting, and our largest growth in commercial real estate was
absolutely in our Wisconsin market and it's a nice turn. And we saw growth, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan,
Illinois, those are sort of the top four out of five states in the commercial end. So it's happening today in our core

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, guys, thank you. So Andy, for you. One of the questions that I've gotten more recently since the forward
curve has really changed quite a bit since back when you guys put out the strategic plan is do you still feel the
same need to grow the newer verticals at the same rates you discussed last year? Or does the likely help from
rate, would that allow you to sort of ease off the gas or be more measured? I think I know the answer from sort of
the tone of a lot of your prepared comments and responses to questions, but would just be curious to hear your
thoughts on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, I think the good news is we started measured. So when you have numbers that you feel are very attainable,
you don't have to change your strategy. We don't have to reach for credit to hit $150 million in ABL. I think we
exhibited that with $67 million in the fourth quarter.
Equipment Finance in a heavy manufacturing hub, people are asking for these kind of loans. So I feel very
comfortable with the numbers. That doesn't change our strategy and our approach. We're going to stay true to the
credit side. We're going to stay true to the prime and super prime and auto. We're going to make sure that we
have the fundamentals down behind it. I see the rate increase as more of a tailwind for us.

I mean, the reality is our run-off portfolios now are down to -- given the payout that we had here in the first – here
in January, down to less than $100 million. So that's the run-off book is $100 million and shrinking and we're
looking to stabilize the mortgage book. So the really only moving parts that we haven't given you is home equity.
And I'd like to think that in a rising rate environment, home equity will probably stabilize. So if those are stable,
then really the growth is all coming from the initiatives that we've outlined and talked through.
