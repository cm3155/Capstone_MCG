Senior Vice President & Director-Corporate Finance & Business Development, Valley National Bancorp
Good morning and welcome to Valley's second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Presenting on behalf of
Valley today are President and CEO Ira Robbins, Chief Financial Officer Mike Hagedorn and Chief Banking
Officer Tom Iadanza.
Before we begin, I would like to make everyone aware that our quarterly earnings release and supporting

With that, I'll turn the call over to Ira Robbins.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Travis, and welcome to all the participants on the call. This morning, I will provide some perspective
on Valley's strong year-to-date performance in the context of a challenging operating environment. Mike will offer
additional details on the financial results before opening the call to your questions.
On our earnings call in April, we outlined organizational efforts to support our employees, clients and communities
amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. But I will not reiterate each of those efforts this morning. I will provide an update
on a few key highlights that speak to Valley's culture, performance and value proposition. Valley originated over
$2.2 billion of loans under the Paycheck Protection Program. Approximately 85% of these loans were for
balances below $250,000 and our median originated loan size was just $43,000. While these numbers reflect the
macro overview of the program, they only broadly speak to the external community impact. More specifically, we
estimate that loans facilitated by Valley employees help preserve over 170,000 jobs within our marketplace.
Equally important, nearly 30% of our PPP loans were provided to minority-owned businesses, non-profits or
women-owned small businesses. With a purposeful direction, our PPP response was differentiated by our high-
touch service which leveraged in internally developed digital process, made possible by the efforts and
commitment of our employees. As we begin to transition to loan forgiveness, more hard work is ahead of us. We
remain committed to helping our clients understand the changing regulations around the program and to easing
the forgiveness process for these small businesses. We believe Valley will continue to distinguish ourselves from
our peers through this process by providing a unique customer experience led by people and supported by best-
in-class technology.
To-date, Valley has granted over 10,000 loan deferrals totaling approximately $4.6 billion. We've closely
monitored the actions of our borrowers that have reached the end of their first deferral period. Approximately
5,000 loans totaling $1.9 billion have completed their initial deferral period and have returned to regular scheduled
payments. Meanwhile, only 10% of commercial deferrals scheduled to return to repayment requested an
additional deferral.
While New York and New Jersey were hit hard very early in the stage of the pandemic, the COVID cases trends
in these markets have improved significantly. These markets continue to progress towards a more complete
reopening earlier than many other markets in the country. Meanwhile, Florida now faces a deteriorating health
crisis similar to that experienced by New York and New Jersey earlier in the year. After working hard to reopen
our branches, we have returned our Florida locations back to appointment-only status. We will continue to take
the necessary steps to protect our employees and all of our clients in Florida.
While we cannot control the environment around us, Valley continues to succeed by focusing on items that we
can more actively manage. In the second quarter of 2020, we reported net income of $96 million and earnings per
share of $0.23. These results include over $2 million of pre-tax expenses associated with COVID-19 pandemic.
On an adjusted basis, pre-tax provision revenue increased 12% from the first quarter, benefiting from aggressive
funding cost reductions that began late in the first quarter.
We remain keenly focused on generating positive operating leverage and optimizing performance. On a year-
over-year basis, we achieved approximately 30% growth in adjusted revenue against just a 12% increase in
adjusted expenses. Our adjusted efficiency ratio was 46.8% in the quarter. While we expect revenue pressure to
build across the industry, we believe that additional expense levers exist at Valley to help us mitigate these

challenges. The quarter's strong bottom line results include a $41 million loan loss provision, which was more
than 20% higher than the first quarter's provision.
While our underlying credit trends remain stable, the economic outlook related to COVID-19 is absolutely
uncertain. We continue to probably build our loan loss allowance to reflect this uncertainty. 2020 has presented
challenges that no one could have predicted at the beginning of the year. Despite this, we are extremely proud of
all of our accomplishments and performance year-to-date. Funding cost reductions and expense management
have accelerated our pre-provision profitability gains and enable us to absorb higher loan loss provisions required
under CECL. We will continue to conservatively navigate these challenging times and we'll position ourselves for
success as the environment normalizes.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Hagedorn for some of the quarter's additional financial highlights.

Michael D. Hagedorn
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Ira. Turning to slide 5, highlighting our quarterly net interest income and margin trends, Valley's
reported net interest margin was 3% versus 3.07% in the first quarter of 2020. Our decision to hold a higher cash
balance in the quarter impacted our margin by approximately 8 basis points. Exclusive of this our net interest
margin would have increased for the third consecutive quarter reflecting the positive impact of our aggressive
funding cost reductions.
On a sequential basis, our cost of interest-bearing liabilities improved by 54 basis points to 0.96% and our interest
expense declined by approximately 33%. We had previously identified the meaningful and unique funding cost
reduction opportunity available to us. We were able to capitalize on this opportunity which enabled us to absorb
asset yield pressures and drive strong net interest income growth from the prior quarter. While a significant
amount of our repricing opportunity has been captured already, slide 6 identifies the amount of retail CDs
expected to mature in the next 12 months at rates well above current offering rates. Specifically, over the next
three quarters, we have roughly $4 billion of retail CDs returning at cost around or above 1.4%.
Slide 7 illustrates the significant reduction in deposit costs achieved over the last few months. On a quarterly
basis, our interest-bearing deposit cost declined 57 basis points to 0.83%. Our all-in cost of funds improved to
0.73% from 1.2% in the first quarter due to deposit cost reductions and significant noninterest-bearing growth.
While CD costs declined 53 basis points sequentially, there may be room to further reduce those costs. As
illustrated on slide 6 in the third quarter we have $1.9 billion of retail CDs maturing at a cost of 1.38%.
From a balance perspective, total deposits increased $2.4 billion or approximately 8% sequentially. Excluding
roughly $1.6 billion of PPP-related deposits at the end of June, sequential deposit growth was 2.5%. Importantly,
noninterest-bearing deposits increased 29% in the quarter or approximately 6% exclusive of PPP deposits. We
continue to experience the customer rotation out of CDs and into more flexible and lower cost transaction
accounts. With branches partially unavailable, customers have continued to migrate towards our online and
mobile banking channels. The count of new online banking users in the second quarter more than doubled from
the first quarter. In the first quarter, we outlined a variety of steps that we undertook to bolster our liquidity
position.
At June 30, our cash and equivalents totaled $1.9 billion, up from 1 billion at March 31. We continue to believe
that holding excess liquidity is prudent given the uncertain environment that we currently face. From an average
balance perspective, we held roughly $1 billion of excess liquidity during the quarter. We estimate this excess
liquidity dragged on our net interest margin by approximately 8 basis points.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Slide 8 details our loan portfolio and the asset yield pressure that we have been experiencing along with other
banks in the industry. During the quarter, loan yields declined 42 basis points. We attributed approximately 7
basis points of decline to PPP loans and the normalization of PCD accretion income from an elevated level in the
first quarter.
Total loans of $32.3 billion included roughly $2.2 billion of outstanding PPP loans at the end of the quarter.
Excluding these PPP balances, total loans declined approximately 4% on an annualized basis as economic
activity has weighed on loan demand in our markets. On a year-to-date basis, we have seen solid activity in our
commercial real estate segments, while non-mortgage consumer balances continue to decline. Commercial line
utilization returned to a more normal 44% following a modest uptick to 46% at the end of the first quarter.
While traditional lending activity in our footprint has slowed, we were very active in the SBA Paycheck Protection
Program as outlined on slide 9. As of mid-July, we had originated approximately 12,800 PPP loans with an
aggregate balance of $2.3 billion, approximately 85% of the PPP loans that we originated were for amounts less
than $250,000. While regulations governing this program have been in flux, we continue to believe that
approximately 75% of the loans that we have originated will be forgiven and off our balance sheet by the end of
the year. In total, we expect to receive more than $60 million of loan origination fees associated with our PPP
activity.
Slide 10 updates our exposure to industries which we believe have primary or secondary pandemic exposure.
Approximately $2 billion or 7% of our non-PPP loans are to industries that have primary exposure to the
pandemic. These industries include non-essential doctor and surgery centers, the hospital and food service
industries and retail companies. We also have identified our exposure to industries such as manufacturing and
education which may be less impacted by the virus.
In total, we have closely monitored the performance of these lending segments and have been pleased with our
borrowers' resiliency. While approved deferrals in these categories totaled approximately $780 million, you can
see that current active deferrals were only $356 million. This is the result of borrowers in these industries coming
off deferral and returning to current or paying status.
Moving onto slide 12, our noninterest income increased 8% from the linked quarter driven primarily by strength in
loan sale gains and stable swap revenue. Adjusted fee income ticked up to 13.7% of total revenue from 13.5% in
the prior quarter. Despite strong fee income growth, fees as a percentage of revenue remains below our target
primarily as a result of continued strong net interest income growth. We remain focused on growing diverse
revenue streams over time and enhancing customer adoption of the various financial products that we offer. Swap
fees were nearly $15 million during the quarter as we originated back-to-back swaps on approximately $390
million of notional loans.
While traditional lending activity slowed in the quarter, our borrowers continued to demand the interest rate
protection provided by our swap offerings. Our net residential mortgage gain on sale income increased
approximately 80% sequentially. The increase included $3 million for the change in fair value of loans held for
sale and further reflected both higher loan sale volumes and gain on sale margin expansion. Residential loans
sold totaled $240 million for the period, up from $200 million in the linked quarter while the gain on sale margin
increased 80 basis points to 3.26%.
Slide 13 provides an overview of our quarterly operating expenses and the continued improvement in our
efficiency ratio. Our expenses on both the reported and adjusted basis increased modestly from the prior quarter.

Adjusted expenses exclusive of de minimis merger charges and $3 million of tax credit amortization totaled $153
million. This was up $2 million or approximately 1.5% from the prior quarter. Adjusted expenses include
approximately $2.2 million of costs associated with COVID-19 and roughly $1.8 million of periodic technology
costs related to our ongoing core system upgrade.
Our adjusted efficiency ratio continue to improve, coming in at 46.8% in the quarter versus 49.3% for the March
period. As Ira mentioned, on a year-over-year basis, we have generated 31% revenue growth with only a 12%
increase in adjusted operating expenses. We remain focused on expense management and are looking to identify
potential opportunities to reduce expenses where possible. For example, it is possible that changing employee
work patterns and customer behaviors may lead to further cost reduction opportunities.
Turning to slide 14, in asset quality, our allowance for credit losses increased $26 million to 0.99% of loans from
0.96% in the first quarter. The allowance represents 1.06% of non-PPP loans, roughly 2 times higher than our
reserved level at the end of 2019. The quarter's reserve build reflects a $41 million provision and nearly $15
million of net charge-offs. Net charge-offs increased $10 million from the prior quarter. This increase is largely
attributable to an $8 million Florida-based restaurant loan that came to Valley in the prior acquisition.
This borrower faced significant challenges prior to the COVID-19 outbreak and became further stressed during
the pandemic. While we have increased our focus on the restaurant exposure within our portfolio, we do not view
this loan as indicative of an outsized stress in our restaurant portfolio or in our Florida loan book.
Taxi medallion loan charge-offs also increased to $3.3 million in the quarter reflective of another downward
revaluation of medallions. The taxi loan portfolio stands at $107 million and carries a 58% specific reserve. The
reserve build in excess of net charge-offs reflects updated economic forecasts within our CECL model. Our CECL
model remains conservatively weighted towards Moody's adverse and prolonged recession scenarios as a result
of the uncertain economic outlook.
Our model reflects some amount of GDP recovery in the third quarter of 2020, followed by GDP declines in the
beginning of 2021 with a slow recovery throughout that year. We also expect unemployment to climb above 11%
in early 2021 and remain in double digits for the foreseeable future. Future provisioning activity will be largely
dependent on the degree that economic outcomes track our expectations.
Non-accrual loans increased $5 million or 2%, reflecting modest increases in the CRE and residential real estate
portfolios. As a percentage of total loans, non-accruals declined to 0.65% from 0.68% in the first quarter. In
addition, we saw a significant improvement in our accruing past due loans, which normalized to 0.29% from
0.52% of total loans in the prior quarter.
You can see the growth in our tangible book value and capital ratios on slide 15. Tangible book value has
increased 8% in the last 12 months. Our tangible common equity ratio declined to 6.98% from 7.31% at March 31.
The $2.2 billion of PPP loans and our excess liquidity position reduced our tangible common equity to total asset
ratio by approximately 70 basis points in the quarter. We continue to feel good about our capital levels and
believe that the sequential growth in our risk-based capital ratios illustrate our improving ability to increase our
capital levels on an organic basis.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ira for some closing commentary.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Thanks, Mike. The headline risk of COVID-19 has somewhat overshadowed Valley's extremely strong year-to-
date performance. We have produced significant positive operating leverage, which has led to a meaningful
improvement in our pre-provision profitability. Over the last few years, Valley has become a more dynamic and
nimble institution, and we remain well-positioned to serve the diverse financial needs of our clients. I am
extremely proud of the immense effort put in by our team and know that this hard work will continue to pay off for
our company and our shareholders.
With that, I'd now like to turn the call back over to the operator to begin Q&A. Thank you.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Frank Schiraldi with Piper Sandler.
Your line is now open.

Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Good morning.

Frank.

Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Just wanted to ask on deferrals. I mean looking at the presentation, it really does seem pretty remarkable looking
at sort of some of the highly sensitive areas like hotels and then how much those deferrals [indiscernible] (20:54)
have come down? [indiscernible] (20:56-21:02) already. But I just want to ask about Florida. [indiscernible] (21:06)
that hotel occupancy rates in Florida were quite high in the early stages of the pandemic, I'm assuming
[indiscernible] (21:17). So I was just wondering your thoughts about and what you've seen so far in terms of
deferral requests down there and how do you anticipate that might trend?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Sure, Frank. It's Tom Iadanza. I'll try my best to piece together the question, you're breaking up a little bit. As slide
4 pointed out, we had total deferrals at high point of $4.6 billion. $3.9 billion of that was commercial related, and
$3.5 billion of that $3.9 billion is secured by real estate. There is no significance by region. Every region was
distributed, a third to Florida-Alabama and two-thirds to New York-New Jersey which is our distribution of our total
loan portfolio. And on the Florida side, it does have the predominant level of leisure and hotel hospitality portfolio.
But I will tell you, of that portfolio, we have $193 million of deferred loans. $138 million met that first 90-day
expiration period, and of that amount, $133 million went back to full pay. That's our hotel experience. And our total
hotel book is $488 million. So 96% of that hotel deferral went back to full pay after 90 days. Okay? So we're
encouraged by the trends. And give you a little bit more highlight because the experience is broad based, we're
seeing that within New York, New Jersey, Florida and Alabama. Look at that retail book we have which is another
high profile, high risk component – that we consider high risk component. We had 90% – let me [indiscernible]

(23:07) 90% of that retail go back to full pay. $359 million met that 90-day period and $323 million went back to
full pay. So that was a 90% experience, again no different in Florida than New York and Alabama.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
So even now with [indiscernible] (23:26) you're not seeing any change?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
No, no. Keep in mind, all of it is secured. We're predominately flagged based on our hotels. We have personal
guarantees. These are people who we've done business with long time who have weathered cycles in the past or
we conservatively underwrite. The average loan to value on that portfolio was 56% at origination, and the debt-
service coverage was 1.7 times pre-pandemic. So, we believe there was a bit of a cushion in there before we
even have to get and rely on the guarantees, but the guarantors are stepping up and they're relatively liquid
people for the most part.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Frank, this is Ira. I think on an anecdotal basis, getting to, I think, the point of your comment is, in our
conversations with many of our borrowers down to the Florida footprint, I think some of the headlines in the
newspapers are really disconnected with what they're seeing from an experience perspective as occupancy rates
really haven't changed that much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
And we don't do the – sorry, Frank, we don't have the...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q

No, no. Go ahead.
[indiscernible] (24:37)

Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
It's mostly around travel and tourism.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Okay. And then just lastly, just the NIM. If I set aside liquidity, it seems like with the CDs coming up for a repricing
still, are you guys confident in core NIM expansion and NII expansion from here into 3Q?

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. Frank, this is Mike. Well, I wouldn't say core NIM expansion necessarily, I would say NIM protection. So I
think as the slide shows that we've used many times – I think it's slide 6, if I'm not mistaken, yes – that opportunity
to reprice a lot of our funding sources gives us the ability to offset the reductions that we are going to see on the
earning asset side. And don't forget that part of that liquidity build that I referenced in my prepared remarks is a
result that we are essentially not buying any new fixed income securities for our investment portfolio. And think of
that as basically insurance because I think the cash flows we would buy today are pretty much the same cash
flows we'd buy in the not too distant future. And so we're going to try to stay liquid in the hopes that maybe this
COVID situation gets better and we'll see some slightly upward tick in interest rates.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
I think right off the bat, consistent with many other banks in the country, we elected to waive fees for many of our
customers that were impacted by COVID-19. That said it is a small component of the entire non-interest income
base. And we have gone back to adjusting fee schedule accordingly.

Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Mike, maybe if we could just start on the NIM just to follow up your – with your comment about liquidity, just how
you're positioning yourself on the deposit side. So just to understand, the intention is to keep it to maintain that
liquidity. And I'm just trying to draw that with because I presume a lot of that came from the PPP deposits and how
you're thinking of the ultimate outflow on that. So just if you could kind of walk through some of the moving parts
on how you're seeing some of that – the liquidity movement?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. So on the first part of your question, as you might have noticed from the prior comments we made in the
first quarter, we have released some of that liquidity already, roughly around $500 million so far. So, the goal isn't
to hold onto that kind of indefinitely. And I think you'll see us selectively use that, where we think it makes sense.
So, I can't promise you that we're going to do that in the third quarter necessarily, we may. But no, we're not going
to hold onto those higher levels longer term. And basically, when this thing started out, liquidity was obviously the
biggest risk. I think now the liquidity risk relative to the industry is abated quite a bit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
And then, the second part of your question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. Just on the PPP side, so we're hearing kind of mixed things in terms of what the ultimate borrower kind of
usage is of those dollars. But how are you sort of expecting kind of the noninterest-bearing deposit flows to go as
it relates to the PPP deposits that built this quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. So, we had originally forecast that we'd start to see some of that in the third quarter, at least in a
meaningful way. And now, I think that's going to be pushed off to maybe fourth quarter to first quarter of next year.
And keep in mind those yields, based upon the size of them because the fee income is different and fee income
accretes through there, is roughly around 3.26% for us. So it's a little bit – it's obviously less than the portfolio, but
it's getting pretty close to where new loan volume is coming on as well.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 23-Jul-2020
Yeah. And Collyn, it's Tom. I just want to add that 21% of our PPP loans were to customers previously not with
Valley. We generated approximately $150 million in deposits that were non-PPP loan-related deposits with that
group and with an opportunity to solicit for even more, we have an active program going after that based on what
we now have as new prospects to generate even more deposits in business from that.

Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Duong with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.

Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi. Good morning, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Duong Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Just a question on your reserves, the 99 basis points now, that's almost double your fourth quarter level. So, with
CECL, that basically implies that you're looking at about 45 basis points of credit loss through the cycle. And the
assumption is based on a double-digit unemployment rate through 2021, is that right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
So I won't specifically address the 45 basis points, but I'm going to point you back to the fact that the model is
incredibly sensitive to the economic forecast, most likely -and most impactful impacts are on GDP and
unemployment. And so, I'll tell you the percentages that we used, so you can get a better feel as to where that
comes out on a weighted average basis. So for the second quarter, we used Moody's June estimates and we
used 50% for their S3 scenario, 20% for S4 and 30% for baseline. And to give you an idea of how the dispersion
is different between those, baseline had GDP for third quarter coming in at 17.2%, and S4 has it at 1.7%. So on a
weighted average basis, it's 9.2% positive.
Now, when you look at the forward – next seven quarters, it goes negative in the fourth quarter, it goes negative
in the first quarter. And as I said in my prepared remarks, the unemployment rate is above 11% whereas in prior
estimates, that was more around 9% when you start to look forward. So it's gotten worse on the unemployment
side and it's gotten less optimistic, if you will, on the GDP side.

Got it. And I guess how is like your reserve level compared to where you guys were in the financial crisis?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
This is Ira. I think it's really got to be aggregated together with even where our capital position was. So when we
went into the last financial crisis, we started with the TCE number, about 5.7%, 5.75%. We're seeing today on an
adjusted basis if you account for liquidity as well as the PPP loans as close to 7.70%. So we're about 200 basis
points more in capital today than when we went into the initial financial crisis. On the coverage ratio with regard to

the overall loan portfolio, we think we're in a real solid position as well. So, on an aggregate basis, we think we
have a lot more reserves from a capital and provision perspective than what we did last time.

Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Breese with Stephens. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
Good morning, Matt.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey. Just in regards to the provision, how much of the $40 million was qualitatively driven. How does that
compare to last quarter? And then with more stability in the Moody's forecast, should we view the majority of the
reserve build in the rearview mirror at this point and provisioning level should start to just reflect growth in charge-
offs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. So the qualitative part was not a large portion of the $41 million. And as it relates to your second part of
your question, personally, I think you might see people – I don't think Valley is the only institution that will do this. I
think there might be some less reliance on the baseline. As you can see even from our weightings, we only used
30% for the baseline this time because I think generally people believe this might last a little bit longer. And so if
you get that economic impact into your model, you might heavily weight. So that would be a bigger driver, I think,
of future reserve build as I said earlier than just changes per se to the Moody's estimate. It'll impact it, but I think
the weightings will be a bigger impact.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Understood. And then on the expense front, you point to $2.2 million of COVID expenses this quarter, $2.1 million
last quarter. A lot of that is in regards to readiness. Should we start to see these figures start to wind down and
therefore, expenses can start to flatten out or come down? And then you also mentioned potential room for
expense saves. Could you just talk about some of the areas where you see that's possible and to what extent?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
So on the $2.2 million, to give you some breakdown on that numbers, roughly $750,000 of that is related to
enhanced cleaning procedures that we've had to do and that is going to be directly correlated to outbreaks and
hotspots within our footprint. So over time, you would hope that that would come down. There's some marketing

related costs and I suppose you could argue whether those are COVID related or not, but they're specifically
related to our recovery CD that we have launched and we've also launched a Phase 2 of that as well. And then
also inside of there that I don't believe will be recurring at least in any material way, our expenses related to
getting ourselves opened up to the various waive process that we're using, things like decals on the floor of
elevators, signage in different places, plexiglass, sneeze guards in certain locations, all of that is in that number
as well and that should over time reduce itself.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
And Matt, this is Ira. I just think following up on your second comment, we still believe that there is significant
opportunity to relook at our business model and improve the operating efficiency further. I think as we continue to
enhance the technology platform that we sit on, there will be operational saves as we continue to move over
across all facets of the organization. If you recall about two years ago, we presented to you what branch
transformation look like at Valley up until this point. We probably exceeded some of them – the metrics and
numbers that we provided to you. If you notice we didn't provide anything this time, an update. We think it's
prudent for us to really reassess the entire platform that we have within the organization when it comes to real
estate expenses. And we continue to look at that and is there more opportunity to look at real estate and not just
from a branch perspective but from a corporate perspective as well. In addition, there's probably a little bit left on
the Oritani.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] We have a follow-up question from the line of Collyn Gilbert with KBW. Your
line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks, guys. Sorry, I wasn't finished. I could probably ask questions for three hours. But I'd try to keep it brief.
So Mike, sorry, just [indiscernible] (36:26) on the NIM. So you had indicated that there may be room on the retail
deposit side to lower again. It seems like there's more than maybe room. What would keep you from being more
aggressive in dropping some of those retail CD costs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
No, I said that there may be some room, that's probably just me doing my normal hedging probably. There is
absolutely – and that's what slide 6 shows. But those rates that you're seeing in the third quarter as an example,
1.38% for maturing CDs, 65 bps for borrowing and BCDs at 59 bps. We know that at today's rates, we'll be able to
buy those same funding sources at lower rates. So absolutely, we're going to continue to see that. The issue
around saying a specific number is especially with the CD book, it depends on what maturity we want to do.
We've been – as this whole thing has been going on kind of silently, we've been building a nice ladder and
extending out some of our longer term deposits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
And I think, Collyn, when you look at the overall deposit book, I think we get criticized a bit based on the cost of
deposits within the organization. I know a lot of that is a function of the market that we operate within. But we
were very, very aggressive compared to many of our peers in dropping rates. I mean our cost of deposits
including noninterest-bearing went to 60 basis points this quarter from 107 basis points the quarter before and
127 basis points a year ago, so we dropped 44% just on a linked-quarter basis. We didn't have any account

attrition. In reality, we increased 6,000 units of noninterest-bearing accounts during the quarter. I think it shows
the stickiness of the types of deposits we have and we're real excited about the opportunity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. And to Ira's point, I would point you to slide 7 and take a look at the savings now in money market accounts
and the growth there. I think that illustrates what he's talking about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Collyn Gilbert Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then just some clarity on some of the fee movement. So first, in terms of just your
outlook on mortgage banking and where you see that trending kind of in the back half of the year, if there's a lot of
pull through that happened in the second quarter or if you expect activity to sort of remain elevated as we move
into the back half of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Hey, Collyn. It's Tom. Yeah, when you look at our second quarter, 66% of our business was conforming for sale
mortgage, 34% balance was general. The refinance market is active, is strong as you would expect in this interest
rate environment. We are pulling through on a similar basis so far in the third quarter. Our pipeline remains
somewhat elevated from, I'd say, first quarter, similar to where the same line in second quarters we were as we
are now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: We have a follow-up question from the line of Matthew Breese with Stephens. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Just one more for me, guys. Just in terms of the deferrals, I think you said 90% – there was a 90% cure rate on
the commercial loans that came up. What was that on the consumer side? And is there any reason to believe that
"blended cure rate" is not something we should apply to the remaining $2.7 billion of deferrals?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Banking Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. [indiscernible] (39:44) Matt, it's Tom. We had $525 million on the residential mortgage fees, approximately
$300 million of that came due, 60% requested second. And keep in mind, we do 90% plus 90%. So, 60%
requested a second deferral, 40% went on to full pay. On our auto piece which is the bulk of the balance of our
consumer, we had $116 million in total, $80 million came up at that – met that first period, $72 million went on full
pay, so that was 90%. So, I think we're going to be – those percentages, again I think are in line with what we
would have expected to see in those two categories.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Chairman, Valley National Bancorp
And Matt, I just think this speaks to the volume as to who Valley is and how we underwrite and the real
differentiation here of our borrowers versus many of our peers.
