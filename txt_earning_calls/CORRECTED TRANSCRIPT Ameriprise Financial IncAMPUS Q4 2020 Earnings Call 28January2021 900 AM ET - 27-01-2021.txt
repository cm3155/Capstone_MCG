Some statements that we make on this call may be forward looking reflecting management's expectations about
future events and overall operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of
today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause
actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our fourth quarter 2020
earnings release, our 2019 annual report to shareholders and our 2019 10-K report. We make no obligation to
publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.
On slide 3, you see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the fourth quarter. Below that you see our
adjusted operating results which management believes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting
the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. Many of the
comments that management makes on the call today will focus on adjusted operating results.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.

James Michael Cracchiolo
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Good morning and thanks for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. As you saw in our release, Ameriprise
delivered an excellent quarter and a very strong year considering the challenging operating environment.
In the quarter, equity markets rallied on positive vaccine news, the outcome of the US election and the likelihood
of further fiscal stimulus. The strength of our advice value proposition, investment expertise and solutions are
translating to our business results. Client activity and flows in the quarter continue to be very strong. And we set
new records, including ending the quarter with assets under management and administration of $1.1 trillion, an
important milestone.
Revenues in the quarter were quite good, up 3% to over $3 billion, driven by strong business fundamentals and
positive equity markets, offsetting the interest rate headwinds. Earnings per share also increased nicely in the
quarter, up 8% and ROE remains very strong and 36%. During the quarter, we continue to make good
investments in the business as well as continuing to execute against our reengineering goals, resulting in a 1%
decline in G&A expenses.
We're always looking to drive efficiency and invest strategically to extend our position. It's core to how we operate.
We also returned more than $500 million to shareholders, which was 90% of our adjusted operating earnings and
among the best in financial services. For the full year, we returned close to $2 billion. Very clearly, our ability to
consistently generate substantial free cash flow as well as to reinvest and return to shareholders are key
differentiators for us.
Let's turn to Advice & Wealth Management, where we delivered a very strong quarter and good organic growth.
Beginning with our clients, we're delivering a differentiated level of advice, keeping clients focused on their goals
which was key in a volatile disruptive year.
Total client assets were up 14% to $732 billion, driven by excellent client flows and positive markets. As you
know, we've built a leading investment advisory business and it continues to grow nicely. In the quarter, wrap net
inflows were close to $8 billion, up 82% over last year. This was another record for us and a great indication of
our excellent client-advisor engagement and focus on growth.

Another highlight was transactional activity bouncing back and up 5% over last year. And client cash balances
continue to grow and ended the quarter at $41.5 billion, up $2.1 billion from last quarter.
Meanwhile, we're continuing to invest to make our offering even more compelling for clients and advisors. We
continue to see very good engagement in our digital capabilities, allowing advisors and clients to interact and
transact seamlessly. And the majority of clients now have their goals online and follow their progress.
Our advisors are utilizing our tools and capabilities on our integrated technology platform. They are reporting that
they're processing business more efficiently and spending more time with their clients and growing their practices.
That's evident in increased financial planning and advisor productivity, which was up 8% adjusting for interest
rates.
You've heard me share that one of the greatest benefits of being an Ameriprise advisor is our caring culture,
including truly best-in-class support and strong field leadership. I recently spoke with all of our field leaders to kick
off the year. They're energized about Ameriprise and are focused on continuing to drive productivity and growth.
This high level of support is also reflected in our recruiting success. Our virtual recruiting program is extremely
effective and continues to drive strong results with 82 experienced advisors joining us in the fourth quarter.
We're recruiting top advisors from across the industry who recognize that Ameriprise offers the value proposition,
technology and level of support that can help them deliver an exceptional advisor-based client experience and
take their practices to the next level of success. And we have a track record of helping advisors grow 2.5 times
faster than peers, which is very compelling from a competitive perspective.
So far in 2021, this momentum continues and the recruiting pipeline remains strong. It was also great to see that
our client service teams were once again recognized by J.D. Power for the excellent experience they deliver. This
certification recognizes best practices from the highest performing contact centers across all industries, not just
financial services.
Regarding the bank. Total assets grew to $8 billion with $7 billion of sweep deposits. We plan to move additional
deposits to the bank this year. We also added pledge loans to the product portfolio in the quarter. And we're
seeing a good response to date. It's an appealing product for higher net worth clients seeking liquidity.
Wrapping up AWM, margin was strong at 19.8% and was up 60 basis points sequentially. As I mentioned earlier,
expenses continue to be well managed with G&A up only 2% and that includes investments in the bank.
Next, Retirement & Protection Solutions. This business is performing well and in line with our expectations. We're
executing our plan to drive a mix shift in the business focusing on higher returning products given the rate
environment, which is further reducing our risk.
Variable annuity sales increased nicely, up 20%, driven by the success of the structured product we introduced
earlier in the year, more than offsetting reduced sales of living benefit products. Very importantly, this increased
the percentage of VA sales without living benefits, which grew to 58% of total sales in the quarter.
In Protection, while sales were down 4% year-over-year, we've seen improvement quarter-to-quarter. Sales of our
flagship VUL product doubled in the quarter offsetting the reduced sales from IUL products. This product both
better meets clients' needs in this rate environment while generating good returns for the firm. Clearly, as
Ameriprise continues to grow overall, the Retirement & Protection Solutions segment will represent a smaller part
of our business mix over time.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
With regard to fixed annuities, I know some of you are interested in our progress regarding a reinsurance
transaction. We are actively looking to execute a transaction this year and are encouraged by the recent uptick in
the 10-year rate.
Turning to Asset Management. We continue to build on our progress and have a great story to share as an active
manager. The team is serving clients well and driving profitable growth. We continue to have excellent client
engagement and investment performance. The investments we're making, including in data and digital, are
helping to drive organic growth at Columbia Threadneedle with strong results in North America.
We're targeting advisors better and delivering a compelling experience. And importantly, we strengthened our
relationship with our distribution partners across regions, including with the large broker-dealer firms and
independents in the US. We're also investing in our operating platform including important work to reduce
duplicate legacy systems.
In the quarter, we completed the final phase of the installation of our global trading portfolio management system
which will help our investment teams and drive additional efficiency and scale globally. With a continuation of
positive flows and positive markets, assets under management grew 11% to $547 billion.
Our Asset Management business is making strong contributions to our overall earnings and free cash flow. And
margin for the quarter was nearly 40%. Looking ahead, we expect to remain in the 35% to 39% range. However, if
these market levels hold, we should come in at the higher end. Strong investment performance has been
essential to our success. And our teams have been collaborating really well through this pandemic.
We have steadily invested to build a strong global platform with a disciplined research focus. And our people are
delivering exceptional performance across all categories, equities, fixed income and multi-asset strategies.
At year-end, Columbia Threadneedle had 108 four- and five-star funds, which shows the breadth and strength of
our product lineup. In equities, on a global basis, over 70% of our funds on an asset-weighted basis were above
medium or beating benchmarks over one-, three- and five-year periods and that's across domestic and
international strategies.
With regard to fixed income, we also had great performance. More than 75% of our taxable funds on an asset-
weighted basis were above medium or beating benchmarks over the same time frames. So with this type of
investment performance and the growth focus across the business, flows continue to be strong. Overall, excluding
former parent outflows, we were net positive $8.3 billion for the quarter, an improvement of $4.1 billion from a
year ago.
In terms of total retail flows, excluding former parent, we were net positive by $7.7 billion, including reinvested
dividends. These positive flows were driven by continued momentum in the US, where we were net inflows for 10
months of the year and that included the dislocation in March.
For the quarter, US retail had $7.1 billion of net inflows. In fact, 30 Columbia strategies were in net inflows and 10
had gross sales in excess of $1 billion in 2020. And that's across equities, fixed income and our multi-manager
lineup.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
In EMEA retail, we were in net inflows of more than $600 million in the quarter with particular strength in
Continental Europe, which more than offset outflows in the UK. We're optimistic that the resolution of Brexit and
the gradual reopening of the UK economy will be positive in terms of investor sentiment.
And in terms of global institutional, we continue to gain traction, have a significant opportunity and platform to
grow. We have a compelling lineup of capabilities and excellent investment performance. We recently added to
our consultant relations team and strengthened client service.
In the quarter, we had net inflows ex former parent of about $500 million, driven by continued strength in EMEA.
The pipeline looks attractive across our regions. But when I look across asset management, I'm very pleased with
the momentum over the last number of quarters and our ability to sustain it.
Stepping back to Ameriprise overall, we're in a terrific position. We're delivering strong result and further
reinforcing our record of navigating uncertain times. I'm incredibly proud of our employees and advisors and the
resilience that they've shown during this pandemic. They've stayed focused on our clients while continuing to
drive the strong results you're seeing. Nearly a month into 2021, I feel very good about the high level of client
engagement and business activity that we're generating. From a capital perspective, we're continuing to deliver a
differentiated level of return. Our balance sheet fundamentals are excellent and we're generating strong free cash
flow.
With that, Walter will cover the quarter in more detail and then I'll take your questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered a strong quarter of financial results and excellent business metrics with
adjusted operating EPS up 8% as strong underlying organic growth more than offset headwinds from low interest
rates. Assets under management and administration reached a record $1.1 trillion including nearly $15 billion of
inflows from wrap and asset management.
We achieved our targeted reengineering for the year while investing for future growth in Advice & Wealth
Management and Asset Management. We continue to effectively manage our profile with continued mix shifts to
lower risk, higher margin Retirement & Protection Solution offerings and are actively exploring additional
reinsurance opportunities.
In 2020, we returned over $1.8 billion of capital to shareholders. Our strong balance sheet fundamentals coupled
with sustained underlying business growth are driving free cash flow generation across our business segments.
This positions us well as we enter 2021.
Let's turn to slide 6. Ameriprise adjusted operating net revenue grew 6% driven by strong underlying business
trends and equity market appreciations after excluding the benefit of $92 million of higher short-term interest rates
in the prior period. General and administrative expenses are down 1% even as we make investments for growth
including the bank.
Expenses also include higher compensation associated with the impact of AMP share price appreciation in the
quarter and strong business performance. We are able to achieve this result through disciplined reengineering
initiatives. In total, we delivered strong underlying EPS growth, excluding interest rates of over 20% and very
strong margins in the quarter.

Turning to slide 7. As Jim mentioned, Advice & Wealth Management delivered robust organic growth. We
continue to benefit from sustained traction in experienced advisor recruiting, our personalized client experience,
effectiveness of our digital tools and success in reaching more of our target market. As you can see in these core
areas, we had strong growth in client assets, wrap flows and advisor productivity. This is a good foundation as we
move forward.
On page 8, financial results in Advice & Wealth Management was strong with underlying adjusted operating
earnings up 19% to $352 million after the $92 million interest rate headwind. This was driven by strong wrap net
inflows, improved transactional activity and higher market levels as well as continued expense management. Pre-
tax adjusted operating margin was 19.8%, which would have been a 160 basis points improvement year-over-
year excluding change in interest rates. On a sequential basis, the margin improved 60 basis points.
Turning to page 9. Asset Management delivered very good financial performance and continued improved flow
trends. The cumulative impact of outflows has been a significant headwind for us in the past. As flows improved
this year, that has declined. And if inflows continue, this would provide a tailwind for us in 2021.
In the quarter, we had inflows of $8.3 billion, excluding former parent related flows, which is a $4.1 billion
improvement from a year ago. Investment performance, [ph] table stake (00:18:21) for net inflows is excellent
across a diverse product set. Adjusted operating revenues were $798 million. Revenue increased 7% reflecting
improved flow trends, stable fee rate and market appreciation after normalizing for the timing of the performance
fees.
General and administrative expenses remain well managed, reflecting disciplined expense reengineering that
funded investments for growth. Adjusted for the timing of performance fees and other compensation-related
expense, G&A increased 2%. Putting this together, pre-tax adjusted operating earnings grew 13% with a 39.5%
margin. Overall, we are very encouraged by the continued progress the business is making that is resulting in
both strong flows and financial performance.
Let's turn to page 10. Retirement & Protection Solutions continue to perform in line with expectations in this
market and rate environment. We are executing our strategy to shift our risk profile. In the quarter, 58% of sales
were on products without living benefits, up 24% a year ago, driven by our new structured variable annuity
product along with the decline in sales of VA products with living benefits.
In Protection, sales were down 4% in total with a meaningful increase in higher-margin VUL and a significant
decline in indexed universal life, a product that is not as attractive in this rate environment. These mix shifts are
expected to continue going forward.
Financial results continued to be in line with expectations. Pre-tax adjusted operating earnings increased 1% to
$180 million. Like the industry, we are seeing an uptick in claim counts related to COVID-19, but we've
experienced a limited financial impact. Overall claims were more favorable than the prior year. This business is
well managed. Net amount at risk remains among the lowest in the industry and our hedging has been extremely
effective.
Turning to page 11. In total, the Corporate & Other segment had a $60 million loss in the quarter, which was a
$39 million improvement from the prior year. Excluding the closed blocks, the loss in Corporate segment
improved 23% to $79 million. The prior-year period had elevated losses related to impairments in the affordable
housing portfolio. The current year had approximately $24 million of incremental compensation expense related to
the impacts of share price appreciation and company performance.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
In our closed blocks, long-term care had $21 million of earnings in the quarter due to a significant increase in
terminations and lower new claims. Fixed annuities had a $2 million loss related to the low interest rate
environment. We continue to evaluate opportunities to execute additional reinsurance transactions this year.
Now let's move to the balance sheet on the last slide. Our balance sheet fundamentals remain extremely strong,
including a liquidity position of $2.3 billion at the parent company, substantial excess capital of $1.9 billion, 98%
hedge effectiveness in the quarter and 97% for the full year as well as a defensively positioned investment
portfolio.
Adjusted operating return on equity in the quarter remained strong at 36%. We returned $502 million to
shareholders in the quarter through dividends and buyback, totaling over $1.8 billion for the full year. Overall, this
was an excellent result for the quarter.
With that, we'll take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first
question comes from Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Kligerman Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Hey, good morning. I'd like to start with the Advice & Wealth wrap net flows. $7.9 billion was phenomenal. Just 1.5
ago, we thought the run rate was just a little over $4 billion. Could you give a little color on the background? What
drove it so high this quarter? And what might be a sustainable range?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes, Andrew. This is Jim. We continued to see a good pickup of activity over the course of the year. We were still
having very strong wrap flows even in the prior quarter as you saw in our results over the year. But we saw a bit
of an increase in the fourth quarter. We actually grew our client base. Our new client acquisition picked up even
more. And we saw a good level of activity with our advisors.
Now some of that could be people feeling a little better as the vaccine came about as well and the idea that the
economy and activities would continue to open up. But I would probably say we've seen a more consistent strong
flow coming in. So we feel good about the underlying growth factors. And it was both from the legacy clients that
we have organically as well as some new clients that we added.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Kligerman Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
I see, great. And then with regard to general and admin across the board. Just a real solid outcome, down 1%
year-over-year. I think earlier last year you were guiding to about $125 million expense, general and admin,
decline year-over-year. And it was down about $76 million as we looked at the quarter. And I think some of that
was the share price. Some of that was maybe other investments that you were making in the company. But just

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
kind of looking forward, could you kind of see another $50 million pickup getting back into that $125 million
objective? Could you go further? Where are you looking toward G&A into 2021?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Okay. So we definitely more than achieved the reengineering goal that we mentioned to you of $125 million. So
that's sort of embedded in our numbers. I think what you're seeing overall and we've been talking about that not
just for like the fourth quarter but over the course of the remaining part of the year after the pandemic. And so we
had increased our reengineering goals in that regard and we did achieve them.
Our expenses are being managed very well. But I would also say we did also increase some investments we
were making. We wanted to accelerate because of the great productivity we're having to even add a bit more in
some of the technology and the capabilities that we wanted to bring to both the advisors and from a client
perspective and our web activities.
So our investment agenda last year was actually a bit higher in total dollars than in the year before. So that was
embedded in our numbers. What I would say is the pickup you saw in a little bit of expenses were more from the
stock price appreciation and what that does in some of our deferral programs on a mark-to-market. And that
absorbed and some true-ups and some compensation based on the year and the strong fourth quarter.
So I feel good about the expenses going into the new year. I think they will increase if the economy opens up a bit
more as we bring travel and T&E and some other expenses back to some extent and we continue our investment
agenda. But I think we're going to manage expenses pretty well. And you know how we do that over time, but
we'll continue to look at the business growth, the revenue growth and the market climate as we do that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Kligerman Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Got it. And maybe just lastly on the fixed annuity block. I think you lost about $2 million in the quarter. Target was
to free up about $700 million in capital. But with kind of a money-losing line like that, do you think you'll get close
to the $700 million? And how imminent is that fixed annuity block sale?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Okay. I'll let Walter respond on the fixed annuity side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So as Jim said and I said in [ph] my talks (00:27:50), we are certainly actively looking and we do believe that
certainly we have freed up the capital that's there. And then we have gauged the [indiscernible] (00:28:01)
implications of the rate. But we certainly feel that we will free up a reasonable amount of capital and we're working
to evaluate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Our next question comes from Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee Q
Analyst, Dowling & Partners Securities LLC
Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Just staying with AWM for a moment. The transactional
activities for mutual funds and long duration products appear to be back to pre-pandemic levels. Can you talk
about how they trended throughout the quarter and what you are seeing into January?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes. So we definitely saw a pickup as we went from the second to the third to the fourth quarter in transaction
activities. And they got back more – back to a normal level. In fact, they were up 5% over the year before is fourth
quarter. So we felt good. The pickup was, as you mentioned, both in the brokerage activity but as well as in some
long duration. Even in our own business where we sell our annuities, there was a strong pickup and continued in
our structured annuity business and even a pickup in the insurance business. So we feel like we've gotten back to
a more normalized level. And we're thinking that that will continue as we go through the new year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee Q
Analyst, Dowling & Partners Securities LLC
Got it. And then in terms of kind of capital deployment, as you plan for 2021, can you remind us kind of how you
think about capital deployment priority in terms of returning to shareholders versus M&A for whether it's AWM or
Asset Management?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So we have a consistent capital deployment strategy, as you've seen over the years. We first of all, make the right
investments in the business that we think are good and appropriate for us that we'll get strong growth and
productivity from. From there, we then evaluate the opportunities that may from both – continuing to us to
increase our dividend, buyback appropriately based on the free cash flow that we generate, which is very strong.
But we also evaluate acquisition opportunities.
And in that regard, we do see that there is more opportunities coming about. But we're very disciplined of what
would strategically help us grow, what we can get good returns, what would fit into both our culture and the
environment to keep us on track. And so we will continue to evaluate that. We have excess capital that would help
along those lines as well as what we would do as we look out based on the cash that we generate. So that's the
way we look at it. We haven't changed that philosophy. And we'll continue to focus in that way as we move
forward.

Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Humphrey, this is Walter. I'd just add that we're still targeting about 90% for this year. I think your question was on
buyback.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Humphrey Hung Fai Lee Q
Analyst, Dowling & Partners Securities LLC
Okay. I guess on the M&A side, just to elaborate a little bit, is there any kind of preference between scale versus
capabilities?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
We look more for additional capabilities and that will continue to add our ability for us to grow. In certain
acquisitions, it does provide some additional scale. We do and we've invested heavily into our platform
capabilities and technology that we could add more assets with very minimal cost. So we feel that we have that
ability as well. But primarily, we'd look strategically about how we continue to round out and have a strong quality
asset manager globally.

Jeremy Campbell Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey, thanks. Just want to stick there with Asset Management for a minute here and you give some good color.
But, hopefully, you could spend some time going into a little more detail around the fund flows and kind of just
wondering which high performing strategies may be showing accelerating inflow momentum and maybe if there
are strategies that are showing either a fading headwinds or an inflection from outflows to inflows. Any color there
would be fantastic.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So I think if you look at our supplemental, you'll see – first of all, we've had a very strong investment
performance across our fund family. Particularly, if you look at – take equities as an example are beating the
benchmark on the one, three and five year; three and five year especially strong. Our fixed income strategies are
strong. Threadneedle is having very strong performance across their range. So we feel like we have a broader
good lineup of funds. As I mentioned too in my talking points, there were over 30 funds that grossed more than $1
billion. We had good net inflows in a number – in the range of funds. So it's broadened from where we were.
So we are continuing to see good flow in equities or particularly in the income-oriented equities across our lineup.
We're seeing a pickup in activity in global and European activity in some of our funds there. In fixed income, we
see it in certain of our income ranges like mortgages, et cetera. And you – also in equities and manage the – we
have risk allocation funds that are doing well and also growth. And we're probably going to see a bit more of a

shift a little bit more into value maybe, which we have a lineup there as well. So I would say it's broadened out. So
I would also reckon that if you look at our lineup in equities, it's been very strong as from a flow perspective.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

And then anything notable that's maybe inflected from outflows/inflows in the past year as the overall numbers
have improved?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
I don't have that in front of me, but we can look at it. I would probably say we've seen some turnaround in like
some of our more concentrated funds that maybe the performance wasn't as strong previously that has bounced
back, where just based on the lower sales activity, there's always a level of redemptions. And so you move into a
net outflow.
But I think some of those have really rectified themselves in some of our fund groups like Contrarian and a few of
the larger fund areas like that that are seeing some nice performance, a select growth area, et cetera. So some of
that is more of a – yeah, to your point, a little bit more of a turnaround or adjustment in – picking up of sales and
lowering of the redemptions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Campbell Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
And then just one final one, just a clarification on the fixed annuity block. I think one thing we've heard in the
industry is that with rates rising in the last quarter of the year, like the bid/ask has widened out a little bit. What are
you guys seeing around demand for that block of assets, especially now with Blackstone getting even bigger
among the alternative guys that have already played in the sandbox there too?

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah, it's Walter. We're seeing good demand as you're indicating. And certainly while our spreads have widened
– excuse me, rates have widened, we've seen some narrowing spreads. But we feel very comfortable that we're
in ranges that transactions could be executed.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just one on the Advice & Wealth Management business. We've been seeing a
nice recovery in margins over the last few quarters. Just wondering if you could just give us a little bit of a color
around where you think margins could trend over the near term. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So I think what we would probably say is we see the trend line continuing. We see our advisor productivity
still quite strong up. If you adjust for sort of the interest, advisor productivity was up 8% or more. And that's across
a very large base and so that's really positive. We've seen a pickup, as you saw, in our flows and fees. Our
financial planning is up. So I would say that we want to continue to see that trend line of the margin continue to
accrete. We also think we've sort of hit a low point on the interest side of that. And over time, as we deploy a bit
more into the bank and get some spread there, that would be helpful as well. So I would probably want to see that
margin continue to be targeted to get back into the 20-plus percent range.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth Lee Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. That's very helpful. And just one quick follow-up just on that fixed annuity reinsurance again. And it sounds
like it's not too much dependent on 10-year yields further rising. But I just wanted to check in to see whether the
outlook for executing a transaction is predicated on any further increase in 10-year yields. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Well, I would say we're in the range. And certainly, from that stand – with the rates where they are and looking at
the spreads that our transactions can be done. So while certainly it'd be beneficial if you get a higher rate coming
in, but we are certainly feeling comfortable in this range. And we are, as Jim indicated, pursuing.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Good morning. Just I guess a follow-up on what you're thinking on risk transfer. Is one of the reasons that we
haven't heard that you've executed a fixed annuity deal yet because you're considering doing something broader
on risk transfer, potentially including the long term care or other insurance businesses, or should we think about
those potential transactions being done separately?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So, Tom, I would probably say as we look at it and I'll have Walter comment. We always evaluate our businesses
and look at them both individually and collectively. But there's nothing that ties together us doing a fixed annuity
transaction versus evaluating something in addition to or different than. So Walter, I'll let you.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 28-Jan-2021
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So let me just say this. On fixed annuities, there's a higher confidence. And clearly, from our standpoint,
that's what we're focusing on. But as Jim has said, we will entertain and look at that from that standpoint. With the
quality of our book and the earnings and everything, it certainly has potential and we will continue to evaluate it.
But right now, we're focused on fixed annuities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. The other thing I would say, Tom, is as you saw, we have shifted our emphasis and also both the new
business being put on but also the current business, derisk a lot in our book just like we had closed off fixed, are
shifting now to structured from guarantees, are shifting from fixed insurance to variable which is a better product
both for the client and us in this rate environment. So we're continuing to change that mix and the shift of that mix,
but we will definitely continue to evaluate if there are other books that could be or should be reinsured or that
would make sense for us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Got you. That's helpful. I guess a question on Advice & Wealth. And Jim, I've heard your comments about I guess
the confidence in terms of the quality of the flows. And is it fair to say that the move up to almost $8 billion of wrap
flows could be a new level that you might be able to sustain? And I guess just relatedly, I just want to make sure
there was nothing unusual or unsustainable in this quarter's result like big ticket new advisors transferring assets
over. Do you feel like this could be a new hire level for AWM [indiscernible] (00:41:47)?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah, I would say, Tom, as I mentioned, all of the flow – mainly the increase of the total flows, we've had more of
an ongoing of bringing in new advisors. And so there is nothing special in the fourth quarter. It was a continuation.
We've continued to bring in a good level of top advisors in the industry with good production. But as you saw,
that's been consistent. Third quarter, we brought in good. Even in the second quarter after the pandemic, that
picked up nicely and the first quarter was good. So no, that continues as an ongoing trend line in the sport of
numbers. But I would say that it was more of increased activity from our current client flows as well as new clients
that our current advisors were bringing into the franchise.
Now whether that continues at $8 billion being the base, I can't tell you that. I think we all saw a pickup in some
level of activities in the fourth quarter in the industry. Clients put some more money to work because maybe it's a
bit more optimism of the opening. But I would say underlying it, we feel good about the activity, the level. It wasn't
like it went from $2 billion to $8 billion. It was $6 billion in the third quarter. But whether it's $8 billion or $7 billion
or $6 billion, I can't tell you that exactly. There's always some level of seasonality et cetera as well. But I feel good
about the underlying and I feel good that there'll be a good underlying trend there as we move into this year if
there's no major disruption. So that's what I would say.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay, thanks. And then, Walter, just one final one. The tax rate moved up a little bit. Can you talk about how we
should think about modeling it over the next year or two? Should we see a little bit of an increase because of the
mix moving to some higher tax businesses now?

Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So I think we pretty much hit our target for the year-end. And you're correct, I would say probably a good
number to think about – it will move up because of the business mix shift. And we're – I would say move up
maybe to 18% would be something like a reasonable number.

Operator: Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath from Citi.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Suneet Kamath Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to go back to the retail flows. If we just think about it at a high level, it seems like
over the past couple of years on a gross basis, your gross inflows have been tracking around $13 billion a quarter
and now we're at something like $16 billion for this year or for 2020. I guess the question is how much of this
improvement would you say is due to un-performance and how much of it is due to sort of structural changes
around distribution platforms and how you've improved your positioning there if there's any way that you can help
us think about that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
I think, Suneet, it's a combination of factors. I think we've definitely – first of all, we've had some strong investment
performance. But I think it's been very consistent and it's been – and now for some that were underperforming
15

has bounced back nicely as well. So across a larger range, we have very good performance. So I think
investment performance is part of a given here of what's necessary.
I think that the team has done a really a great job of broadening the distribution, getting better relationships
established more on the various platforms and the due diligence and et cetera. I think we have a wide range of
products that are – a wider range that are being considered than in the past as well and particularly in certain
categories that are making sense like I said in income categories. So I think it's a combination of factors that we
worked hard at over the last number of years that is starting to show some good results.
We've made a lot of investments both in the AWM business to continue to get flows and productivity and the
same thing in the Asset Management business. We continue – we actually completed our whole trading and
attribution platform in Columbia Threadneedle. The ability to share research globally has improved the ability to
actually get more data and analytics informed to our investment people, our distribution people to improve
targeting to understand where there might be some good opportunities.
I actually think that Europe showed a nice bounce back. Remember, we had to go through a lot of change there of
establishing a whole European lineup of funds with Brexit. And it sort of took us out of the market a bit for a while.
And now that we've got that lineup established, we saw really strong flows into Europe this last quarter. UK's still
a little weak because of the Brexit and the economy being closed. But we still see some signs that if that can open
with Brexit moving to another – completion there that that would also help. So I think it's a combination of factors
just as you said. I wouldn't point to one, but that's what gives us a good feeling as we move forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Suneet Kamath Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. And then I guess moving to A&WM. If we look at the capital that you have in that segment, it's up about
$300 million year-over-year. I'm assuming that's based on the capital you're putting in the bank. So the question is
how much capital would you be willing to put in the bank to support growth? And how do you think about sort of
the tradeoff in terms of capital that you could use for other purposes and then growing the bank?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So I would start, but I'll let Walter complete. We feel like as we can continue to derive good margin and good
returns from the bank activity as a complement to get greater spread or growth in various loan books there like
our pledge assets was growing nicely in the fourth quarter. We took over half of that book back. And the growth is
being picked up, which is – it will be a good product for us.
So we feel very comfortable continuing to add capital as required there. As you can see, our overall returns for the
total firm are up in the mid to upper 30s. So it's not as though we have a return issue. And with still – even with
that, our cash flow and what we generate is strong. So it still gives us a good capital that we could continue to
return or look for inorganic acquisitions. So I don't think that is going to be a pressing issue for us. But, Walter, if
you have something to comment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
No. The only thing I'll add to that is that we have, in our plan, allocated additional capital for the growth that Jim
was talking about and feel comfortable. And obviously, the return is certainly good when we look at it relative to

the off-balance sheet. So we feel comfortable with that and to then maintain that risk-return equation. So, yes, we
have allocated more capital to it and we have the capacity to do that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
And also, Suneet, as you can see, whether we evaluate the sale and do a transaction of fixed annuities, that will
free up capital there or even lighten some of the areas of where – we have in some of the fixed books.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, Jim. Hey, Walter. Good morning. A couple of follow-ups around the Asset Management business as well.
Could you guys talk a little bit around sort of the incremental improvement in retail flows that we've seen for
several quarters now? And by the way, it feels like that's continuing into the new year, which is great. But that
incremental improvement, how much of that is coming from AWM versus third-party distribution? I know that's
been a big focus to [indiscernible] (00:50:37) third-party distribution platforms.
And as that occurs, how sort of does that mix shift, if it's meaningful at all, sort of impact the profitability for AMP
as a whole? So in other words, like if you get much bigger in third-party distribution, does it impact sort of the net
profitability for firm-wide kind of flows that are coming through those channels?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So I'm not sure I understand the second part of the question. But I would first – and for the first part, I would say
we've seen a nice pickup through the third-party channels in complement to Ameriprise. Ameriprise actually
picked up a bit. But what I would just say it is no different than what we're seeing as a pickup across the major
distributors that we have. And so both had been positive in that regard because of the combination of the
products that were put into market and the performance et cetera.
With regard to what does that mean, the economics between the internal sale and the external sale to us is the
same. We pay the same on it. The fees are the same on it, et cetera. So I'm not sure there is a material difference
in that way. But, overall, as you continue to get good flows, I think the return will be good for us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. All right. If no material difference, then we can skip like that second part. I guess when it comes to M&A,
you've given a little bit of color. So it sounds like if you were to do something on the Asset Management M&A
side, you're kind of looking at capability type of deals over kind of big deals for scale purposes alone. So what are
the capabilities that you guys still find compelling in particular to kind of better complement the rest of your
platform?

James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So I would say, Alex, as we looked at our business, we have a good lineup. We have scale. We have a global
platform today. It's not as though, however, I could say we have everything we would want in fixed or equities or
solutions in all parts of the world. So I think we individually evaluate that from sort of the core of what we do
manage today as well as looking at more of the type of platforms that are necessary.
So we're growing a bit more in our solutions business. We're adding some alternatives, some real estate and
things like that over time. So it's more of are there other distribution capabilities and other methods to add to and
how we manage assets for clients, things like that as well as from a product perspective. We're not against adding
scale. Let me be very clear about that. But it would have to be a transaction where it gives us a complement of
things rather than we just want to put assets on the platform.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. All right. It sounds like a pretty wide range thing, I guess. Just a quick follow-up for Walter. I think there was
an earlier question on G&A at a firm-wide level, not – I know people like to ask about AWM. But if you think about
firm-wide G&A, about $3.1 billion in 2020. It sounds like that could grow a little bit if maybe T&E comes back and
things like that. What is a reasonable growth rate for 2021 over that $3.1 billion number?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Alex, like I said, we're managing expenses so well and we're looking at the environment. But I would say that you
should look for a couple of basis points that – we will evaluate on that. A couple of percent points on that. That's
the range as we look at it. And we're looking to again continue our investment strategy at the same time with our
reinsurance programs. But that's a reasonable range, a couple of percent points.

Yeah. I'll begin and let Walter – so we see an opportunity to continue, as we said, both for the movement of some
of our sweep activities further into the bank. As you saw over the course of last year, we moved the bank up from
roughly $4 billion to $8 billion. So we gradually started to shift more into the bank. We see that continuing in the
2021 here in the new year. We're also trying to add more on the product capability like we picked up the pledge
loan book. We launched a mortgage product. We'll start to look to add some deposit products, other deposit
products in the latter part of the year, maybe into next year. So there are different things like that we're looking at.
But we feel the opportunity that we'll continue to shift a bit more into the bank on a gradual quarterly basis as we
move forward.

a certain position with that.

Operator: Our last question comes from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erik Bass Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Hi. Thank you. Can you help us think about the overall organic growth in the AWM business? We can obviously
see the wrap net flows and total client AUM. But are there other metrics you can point to that help to paint a more
holistic view of organic net flows and new client growth and how this compares to some of your peers?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I could probably say that organic growth in client acquisition is up nicely both for the overall client base, but
in particular, also for what we would call the targeted clients that we want in the [indiscernible] (00:57:31)
category. That has been nice and strong and picked up nicely as we went through the quarters in the year.
The flows from the current client base continues to be good and actually picked up further in the fourth quarter as
I said to you. The years that we're bringing in and the business and production they're bringing in continues along
the trend line that we spoke to you about particularly as we continue to move more years into both the employee
channel and the independent channel. And that has picked up nicely and continue to add scale to us. So it's a
combination of factors. We continue to get more efficient based on the technology we deploy that helps advisors
concentrate more on their client engagement and can actually focus more on what they can do to deepen.
Our advice formula is working really well. We have more than 50% of – the majority of our clients now have goals
online that they can track and progress with and see very visibly of what they're doing and executing their
19

strategies. So all of those things, we feel, really strengthen the underlying core of the base. And so remember,
with the client base we have, with the deepening we have with those clients, with the further engagement around
advice and with our advisors now feeling a little more comfortable dealing with the pandemic that they can go out
and get more new clients and add clients in this environment or as the environment improves and open, I think,
will be a positive for us.
So I can't judge it against any particular – I know a number of our competitors have – if I look at what the wire
houses reported, et cetera, I think we're standing pretty strong against that. If I look at competitors that have
acquired and have added through acquisitions; of course, you're always going to see an increase because of
what's put on from that end on a comparative basis. So I can't necessarily separate them. But I feel organically
and from a core business, we're doing very well.
