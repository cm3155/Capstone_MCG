Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
Joining me on the call this morning is M&T's Senior Executive Vice President and CFO, Daryl Bible. Now I'd like
to turn the call over to Daryl.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible
Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with our purpose, mission and operating principles on
slide 3. I would like to thank our more than 22,000 M&T colleagues for all their hard work, whether serving our
customers or our communities, our employees continue to deliver on our purpose, making a difference in people's
lives.
This purpose drives our operating principles. We believe in local scale, that is combining local knowledge and
hands-on customer service of community bank with the resources of a large financial institution. Our 28
communities are led by on-the-ground regional presidents. Their knowledge allows us to better understand and
meet the needs of our customers and communities. And importantly, this approach continues to produce strong
results for our shareholders. Our local scale has led to superior credit performance, top deposit share and high
operating and capital efficiency over the long-term.
Moving to slide 4. Our seasoned talent and diverse board are keys to gaining in-depth understanding of our
customers' needs and expectations. We have sound technology solutions, coupled with caring employees, which
provide a differentiated client experience.
Please turn to slide 5. This slide showcases how we activate our purpose through our operating principles. When
our customers and communities succeed, we all succeed. Our investments in enhancing the customer experience
and delivering impactful products have fueled organic growth. We also believe in supporting small business
owners, who play a vital role in our communities.
Despite operating in only 12 states, we are ranked as number six SBA lender in the country, the 15th consecutive
year M&T is ranked in the nation's top 10 SBA lenders. And for the first time, we have finished as the top SBA
lender in Connecticut, an important milestone following our acquisitions of People's United.
Our commitment to supporting the communities we serve extends to affordable housing projects with almost $2.3
billion in financing and over 2,600 home loans for low and moderate income residents. Additionally, M&T Bank
and our Charitable Foundation granted over $47 million in support of our communities in 2022 and approximately
$30 million so far in 2023.
Please turn to slide 6. Here, we highlight our ongoing commitment to the environment. Last year, we invested
over $230 million in renewable energy sector, and have significantly reduced our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions
since 2019. Our ESG report was published in July, but I encourage you to review this slide for some of the
highlights. M&T's ESG ratings have improved at Moody's, MSCI and Sustainalytics.
Turning to slide 8. There are several successes to highlight this quarter. We continue to see growth in auto
dealerships, as well as specialty businesses. We continue to grow customer deposits despite increasing
competition and building on the strong liquidity position and comparative strength of our financial position in the
industry allows us to continue lending in support of communities and local businesses.
We remain focused on diligently managing expenses. Our third quarter results continue to reflect the strength of
our core earnings power. Third quarter revenues have grown 4% compared to last year's third quarter. Pre-
provision net revenues have increased 4% to $1.1 billion. Credit remained stable. Net charge-offs decreased in

the third quarter and year-to-date, we still remain below the historical long-term average. GAAP net income for the
quarter was $690 million, up 7% versus linked quarter in 2022. Diluted GAAP earnings per share, was $3.98 for
the third quarter, up 13% from last year's similar quarter.
Now let's review our net operating results for the quarter on slide 9. M&T's net operating income for the third
quarter, which excludes intangible amortization, was $702 million and diluted net operating earnings per share
was $4.05. Net operating return on tangible common equity was 17.41% and tangible book value per share
increased 3% compared to the end of June.
On slide 10, you will see that diluted GAAP earnings per share was down 21% from linked quarter. Recall the
results from the second quarter of last year indicated an after-tax $157 million gain from the sale of the CIT
business in April. Excluding this gain, GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share were down 3% compared
to the linked quarter. On a GAAP basis, M&T's third quarter results produced an ROA and ROE of 1.33% and
10.99%, respectively.
Next, we will look a little deeper into the underlying trends that generated the third quarter results. Please turn to
slide 11. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.79 billion in the third quarter, down $23 million from the
linked quarter. This decline was driven largely by higher interest rates on consumer deposit funding.
An unfavorable funding mix change, partially offset by higher interest rates on earning assets and one additional
day. The net interest margin for the past quarter was 3.79%, down 12 basis points from linked quarter. The
primary drivers of the decrease to the margin were an unfavorable deposit mix shift, which reduced margin by 7
basis points.
The net impact from higher interest rates on customer deposits, net benefit from higher rates on earning assets
which we estimate reduced the margin by 6 basis points. The remaining 1 basis point was due to higher non-
accrual interest, net of the impact of one additional day.
Turning to slide 12. Average earning assets increased $1.5 billion from the linked quarter, due largely to the
strong deposit growth that drove the $3 billion growth at the Fed. Average loans declined $928 million and
average investment securities declined $630 million.
Turning to slide 13 to talk about average loans. Total loans and leases averaged $132.6 billion for the third
quarter of 2023, down 1% compared to the linked quarter. Looking at loans by category, on average basis
compared to the second quarter, C&I loans increased slightly to $44.6 billion. We continue to see growth in dealer
and specialty businesses.
During the third quarter, average CRE loans decreased by 2% to $44.2 billion. This decline was driven largely by
our continued strategy to reduce on-balance sheet exposure to this asset class. We have chosen to modernize
our suite of products and services to offer more alternatives to better serve customers and to do so in a more
capital-efficient manner possible.
Average residential real estate was $23.6 billion, down 1%, largely due to portfolio paydowns. Average customer
loans were down slightly to $20.2 billion. The decline was driven by lower auto loan and HELOC balances,
partially offset by the growth in recreational finance and credit card loans.
Turning to slide 14. Average investment securities decreased to $28 billion during the third quarter. The duration
of the investment securities book at the end of September was 3.9 years and the unrealized pre-tax available-for-

sale portfolio was only $447 million. At the end of the third quarter, cash held at the Fed and investment securities
totaled $59.2 billion, representing 28% of total assets.
Turning to slide 15. We continue to focus on growing deposits with our customers, and we're pleased with the
growth in both average and end-of-period customer deposits. Average total deposits grew $3.3 billion. However,
consistent with our experience in prior rising rate environments, increased competition for deposits and customer
behavior continues the mix shift within the deposit base to higher cost deposits. Average customer deposits
increased $1 billion. The customer deposit mix to migrate to average demand deposits declined $2.3 billion in
favor of commercial sweeps and customer money market savings and time deposits.
Average brokered deposits increased $3.2 billion (sic) [$2.3billion], while federal home loan bank advances
decreased $2.2 billion. On average, brokered money market and NOW increased $800 million brokered time
increased $1.5 billion. Brokered deposits represent just one of the several funding vehicles that we can employ in
our management of the balance sheet. At September 30 of this year, brokered deposits represented 8% of our
outstanding deposits and short-term borrowings.
The pace and reduction in demand deposits seem to have decreased during the quarter. Our determined focus
on retaining and growing customer deposits yielded positive results during the quarter.
Next, let's discuss non-interest income. Please turn to slide 16. Non-interest income totaled $560 million in the
third quarter compared to $803 million in the linked quarter. As noted earlier, the second quarter included $225
million from the sale of the CIT business. Excluding this gain, third quarter non-interest income decreased $18
million compared to the second quarter driven predominantly by $15 million related to one month of the CIT trust
revenues included in the previous quarter. Other revenues categories were largely unchanged from the linked
quarter.
Turning to slide 17 for expenses. Non-interest expenses were $1.28 billion in the third quarter of this year, down
$15 million from the linked quarter. That decrease in expense was due to $11 million in lower compensation and
benefit costs, reflecting lower average head count, lower expenses for contracted resources and overtime. $6
million lower in other cost of operations, largely reflecting lower sub-advisory fees as a result of the sale of the CIT
business, lower legal-related expenses, partially offset by losses associated with certain retail banking activities.
The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization and merger-related expenses from the numerator and
security gains or losses from a denominator was 53.7% in the recent quarter compared to 53.4% in the linked
quarter after excluding the gain from the sale of the CIT business.
Next, let's turn to slide 18 for credit. The allowance for credit losses amounted to $2.1 billion at the end of the third
quarter, up $54 million from the end of the linked quarter. In the third quarter, we recorded a $150 million
provision in credit losses, which was equal to the second quarter. Net charge-offs were $96 million in the third
quarter compared to $127 million in the linked quarter. The reserve build was primarily reflective of softening CRE
values and the variability in the timing and the amount of CRE charge-offs. At the end the third quarter, non-
accrual loans were $2.3 billion, a decrease of $94 million compared to the prior quarter and represent 1.77% of
loans, down 6 basis points sequentially.
As noted, net charge-offs for the recent quarter amounted to $96 million, significant charge-offs were tied in four
large credits, three large office buildings in Washington, D.C., Boston and Connecticut, and one large healthcare
provider operating in multiple properties in Western New York and Pennsylvania.

Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 29 basis points for the third quarter, compared to
38 basis points in the second quarter. This brings our year-to-date net charge-off rate to 30 basis points, which is
below our long-term average of 33 basis points.
We continue to assess the impact on future maturities and our investor real estate portfolio due to the level of
interest rates, the impact of value declines and the emerging tenancy issues.
Continued targeted deep portfolio dives in office, healthcare and multifamily portfolios are being done to identify
any new emerging issues. When we file our upcoming Form 10-Q in the few weeks, we will estimate the level of
criticized loans will be up to mid-to-high single-digit percent as compared to the end of June, largely due to
increases in investor real estate.
Reflective of the financial strength and portfolio diversification of the CRE borrowers, almost 90% of the criticized
loans are paying as agreed. Loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest, were $354 million
at the end of this quarter, compared to $308 million -- $380 million sequentially and total 76% of these 90 days
past due loans were guaranteed by government-related entities.
Turning to slide 19 for capital, M&T's CIT ratio at the end of September was an estimated 10.94% compared to
10.59% at the end of the second quarter. The increase was due in part to the continuation of the pause of
repurchasing shares.
At the end of September, based upon the proposed capital rules, the negative AOCI impact on the CET1 ratio
from the available-for-sale securities and pension-related components would be approximately 36 basis points.
Now turning to slide 20 for outlook. With three quarters in the books, we will focus on the outlook for the fourth
quarter. First, let's talk about the economic outlook. The economic environment was supportive in the third
quarter, and we were cautiously optimistic heading into the last quarter of this year.
In the third quarter, the overall economy continued to expand, thanks to the strong consumer spending and
steady capital expenditures by businesses, though the housing market continues to struggle in the high rate
environment.
Encouragingly, inflation continued to slow in labor markets, while still tight improved substantially with steady
hiring, while age pressures dissipated. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we are cautiously optimistic, that the
economy will continue to grow, but at a slower rate.
We expect that, that slower growth will continue reducing inflation pressures. The Federal Reserve has probably
reached the end of its hike cycle, given slower inflation and recent run-up in long-term rates.
With that economic backdrop, let's review our net interest income outlook. We expect taxable equivalent net
interest income to be in the $1.71 billion to $1.74 billion range. As we noted on the previous calls, a key driver to
net interest income continues to be the ability to efficiently fund, earning asset growth.
We expect the continued intense competition for deposits in the face of industry-wide outflows. We remain
focused on growing customer deposits. For the fourth quarter, we expect average deposits to be about the same
level with growth of interest-bearing customer deposits but continue to decline in demand deposit balances. This
is expected to translate into a through-the-cycle interest-bearing customer deposit beta through the fourth quarter
this year to be in the mid-40% range. This deposit beta excludes brokered deposits; including brokered deposits,

would add 6% to the beta. While the percent of the cumulative beta is slowing, we anticipate it will continue rising
into the first half of next year.
Next, let's discuss the outlook for the average loan growth, which should be the main driver of earning asset
growth. We expect average loans and lease balances to be slightly higher than the third quarter of $1.33 billion
level. We expect the growth in C&I but anticipate declines in CRE and residential mortgages, while consumer loan
balances should be relatively flat.
Turning to fees. We expect non-interest income to be essentially flat compared to the third quarter.
Turning to expenses. We anticipate expenses, excluding intangible amortization and the FDIC special
assessment to be in the $1.245 billion to the $1.265 billion range in the fourth quarter. Intangible amortization is
expected to be in the $15 million range and FDIC special assessment is anticipated to be $183 million. Given the
prospects of slowing revenue growth, we remain focused on diligently managing expenses.
Turning to credit. We continue to expect loan losses for the full year to be near M&T's long-term average of 33
basis points, which implies fourth quarter charge-offs could be higher than the third quarter. For the fourth quarter,
we expect taxable-equivalent tax rate to be in the 25% range.
Finally, as it relates to capital, our capital, coupled with limited investment security marks have been a clear
differentiator for M&T. M&T has proven to be a safe haven for clients and communities. The strength of our
balance sheet is extraordinary. We take our responsibility to manage our shareholders' capital very seriously and
we will return capital when it is appropriate to do that.
Our businesses are performing very well, and we are growing new relationships each and every day. We are still
evaluating the proposed capital rules so that we believe that now is not the time to be purchasing shares. That
said, we are positioned to use our capital for organic growth. Buybacks have always been part of our core capital
distribution strategy and will again in the future. In the meantime, our strong balance sheet will continue to
differentiate us from our clients, communities, regulators, investors and rating agencies.
To conclude on slide 21, our results underscore an optimistic investment thesis. While economic uncertainty
remains high, that is when M&T has historically outperformed its peers. M&T has always been a purpose-driven
organization with successful business model that benefits all stakeholders, including shareholders.
We have a long track record of credit outperforming through an all economic cycles with growth about two times
that of peers. Our strong shareholder returns include 15% to 20% return on tangible common equity and robust
dividend growth.
Finally, our disciplined acquirer and prudent steward of capital – shareholder capital and our integration of
People's merger is completed. We are confident in our ability to realize our potential post-merger.
Now with that, I'll turn it back to our caller, who'll briefly review the instructions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Please go
ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi, good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Good morning, Manan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
You spoke about a mid to high single-digit increase in criticized loans this quarter. I was wondering how is the mix
changing between hotel, healthcare and office. And it also looks like non-accrual loans dipped lower this quarter,
so can you talk about what the drivers are there? Whether there's loan sales or any other underlying drivers? And
if that had any benefit to net interest income this quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah, happy to do that. So on the criticized increase, it's really just more of the same that we're seeing. It's more
increases just in our IRE portfolio, primarily on the office side for the most part, so nothing really different from
trends that we're seeing. As far as non-accruals, there was one large property that was sold in New York that was
a primary driver for the non-accruals. We actually had a gain in that, that helped margin probably by about $5
million in the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Thank you. And then maybe just on the buybacks. What is the criteria to resume the buybacks from here,
because it seems like we have more clarity on regulation at this point. Is it a function of M&T issuing more in the
debt markets and then starting buybacks? Is it to do with the credit rating agencies? Any color you can throw
there would be helpful, especially given how much excess capital M&T's have at this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. So I definitely agree with you, Manan, in that we do have excess capital. But right now, the economy is still
kind of unpredictable, rates higher for long – will probably continue to have stress on clients over the next couple
of quarters if that actually comes to fruition. I think we're just trying to be conservative and cautious at the same
time. And it's also for us to actually have an opportunity to continue to grow organic growth in our commercial and
consumer books and our trust books as well.

So I think we're just trying to be cautious. And we know when the economy gets a little bit more comfortable, we'll
consider repurchases there. It is true to our long form strategy, the capital distribution back to the shareholders.
It's not going anywhere, but we just want to continue to make sure that we're strong and can grow and serve our
customers right now.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I guess just want to follow-up Daryl in terms of – so your NII guide for the fourth quarter is fairly clear, but we are
hearing from some of your peers around potential for the margin NII bottoming in the fourth quarter, especially if
the Fed is done. Give us your thought process around, is there something about your balance sheet, why that
might get pushed out because of deposits have been related to the price or the dynamics on your balance sheet
or your markets, any color there would be appreciated?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. Manan, it's really the biggest driver for the net interest margin for us right now is really what happens to our
noninterest-bearing deposits. We were down $2.3 billion. That was better than what we thought it would be and
we think that it's slowing down. We'll see how that plays out in the fourth quarter. But that is probably the biggest
determining factor. When you look at our balance sheet, though, I'm actually pretty pleased with how the assets
are repricing. If you look at the reactivity rate on some of our fixed portfolios, if you look at this quarter, like our
consumer loan portfolio was up 22 basis points. We have home equity in there that is prime related, but that's a
smaller percentage.
We have really good repricing in other consumer portfolios like auto was up approximately 300 basis points in
what was rolling off versus what was rolling on. If you look at our RV and boat portfolio, that was up approximately
250 basis points of what was rolling off, rolling on. So I think once we get more stability in the disintermediation of
deposits, I'm more favorable into margin stabilizing. I think the asset side is actually performing pretty well.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Noted. And I guess just moving maybe, give us a mark-to-market in terms of commercial real estate, what you're
seeing around, there's some concern whether if we go into next year, given what the yield curve's done, we might
see some more pressure flow beyond CRE office into multifamily. So one, give us a sense of like on the CRE
office, has the visibility improved around the level of marks that you might have to take as some of this works
through the system, and whether or not you're seeing more pain beyond the office complex?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. So on the office side, I would tell you, our credit team, we feel really on top of what's going on there. I think
we are actively looking at any credit that could be and have any issues whatsoever we're looking at it. I'm trying to
put the right valuation in there. We traditionally run with a higher level of criticized assets because we have a lot of
long-term clients that have been with M&T for a long time period. They have other sources of cash flow to help
carry the loans and are willing to put in equity to help support the loans. When we do find loans that there is not
support around, we'll probably move to exit those.
As far as the valuations go, there's still not a whole lot of specifics out there. We did have that one sale for us that
actually was a little bit better than what we had it marked there, but that was one big loan. So I wouldn't say that's
a trend by any stretch right now. But I think we feel pretty good on where we are. As far as the other asset
classes, I think we just with rates higher for longer just puts more – just tougher for some of the customers. And
multifamily is an area that we are looking at as well.
Nothing really is popping out of anything very severe there yet, but we're just trying to stay ahead of what
potentially could happen and kind of be preemptive if we see anything. So we're just preparing. Our credit team is
very experienced. We've been very good with commercial real estate for a long time, and we are on top of where
we are.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi, good morning. I just wanted to clarify sort of the responses to Ebrahim's question, Daryl. I'm just wondering as
you think about the forward curve as we see it, at what point do you expect net interest income to trough based
on what we know about the curve and what we know about the various puts and takes for growth and deposit
actions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. From a framework perspective, it's really when the disintermediation slows down. I think when
disintermediation slows down, I think the asset side, is performing well and will continue to reprice higher because
I think we're going to have a steeper curve for a longer period of time.

And hopefully, that will happen in the next couple of quarters, but it's really hard to know right now. We think it's
slowing, but I think we'll just see how that plays out. I'll give you guidance next earnings call on the fourth quarter
on that. But conditions could be slowing down with what we're seeing right now, but one quarter is not a trend. I
just want to get a couple of quarters under our belt before we really say net interest margin is going to stabilize.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And as a follow-up to that, your period-end cash balance rose to $30 billion, Daryl, which is awesome dry
powder. And as we think about the quarters ahead on one hand, potentially there the Fed is peaking, right? And
you seem to be rather asset sensitive.
On the other, you have all these new rules on liquidity that we don't have yet, as well as treatment of AFS for
regional banks. So how should we think about an absence of stronger net loan growth. The puts and takes of
what you're -- are you just going to continue to build cash and be a little bit more asset sensitive even though
we're peaking in rates as we figure out what the final rules look like on both capital and liquidity?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
I think we have the strong position at the Fed that's intentional for us right now. We want to be really conservative
with our cash and liquidity position. Like I said earlier, the economy is doing okay, but slowing down and maybe
hopefully not get into a recession, but we just want to be really careful and cautious from that perspective. So I
think it's an intentional where we're staying there. Will we invest some of that obviously into loans, we would love
to do that to support our customers, but we are not widening our credit box whatsoever. We're going to grow what
the market will give us. But we do think there's opportunities to grow relationships and to potentially grow
balances in some of our loan categories. So we'll see how that plays out.
As far as deploying some of it the cash into the securities portfolio. I would just say that over the next year, you
might see us move a little bit to the investment portfolio, but it will be on a gradual basis.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
So we haven't made that probably, Matt, but it continues to increase where we are right now. So we had an
increase in our allowance, we had a little over $50 million. I'd say about half of it went to the CRE portfolio, and
half of it went to the C&I portfolio. So I think we were adding it where we think it's appropriate based upon our
models and performance.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Yeah, that would be helpful to get over time. I know everybody's book is a little bit different, but many of
your peers are disclosing, so that would be helpful as you think about disclosures, obviously an area of focus.
Maybe switching gears, like, as you think about all the capital that have and liquidity and the balance sheet
flexibility, what areas of lending are you leaning into, not just kind of looking out one quarter but the next few
quarters. And is it kind of doing more business with existing customers or also trying to grow the customer
footprint?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
I mean, this past quarter, we had growth in our dealership businesses. As the strike was starting to happen, I
think a lot of dealers actually stocked up on used cars, and that actually drove an increase in utilization in that one
sector a little bit earlier than normal there. That will probably continue to play out, I think, into the fourth quarter
while would be one. Our large corporate banking, I think, has some growth opportunities where we're positioned
there.
Specifically on fund banking, I think we're growing there nicely. It's a very conservative portfolio, very short-term
oriented, lower risk areas. So I would say most of the growth that we're seeing is in the C&I space. Those are the
highlights right now. It is very competitive in middle market C&I. We are trying to be competitive there. But right
now, the higher interest rates are just putting a lot of our commercial clients to be a little bit more cautious. But
when they're willing to borrow, we're trying to help them when that's -- when we're able to do that. So.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thank you. Good morning. Hey, Daryl. I wanted to follow-up on your comments around higher-for-longer rate
environment being tougher for your customers. As you look across your portfolio, do you have a good handle on
the degree to which some of your customers had put on swaps maybe when we were still under [indiscernible]
(00:38:05) two to three years ago. So they haven't yet felt the pressure of higher rates. Curious about whether the
rolling off of those swaps is something you worry about not really -- not just in CRE, but really across all loan
categories.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. I think, obviously, Bill, I mean, people that did swaps three years ago are really fortunate that they did, but it
depends on the maturities when they roll-off. And when they do roll-off, it does put pressure on some clients that
basically just have higher interest payments there. So that is impacting much broader than just office, broader
than just CRE. It's impacting, I think, all of America right now, to be honest with you. I mean, just higher rates for
longer. I think the Fed wants to slow the economy down and we're definitely having that impact to do that, and
they're accomplishing what achieving there.

But we -- like I said earlier, we are on top of the portfolios where we see maturities coming up. We're looking at
what we have to do, if anything, do they have other support on it. So we're trying to stay ahead of what's coming
down the pike. Most of the maturities and swap are lined together so that they're pretty much in balance. So when
things come close to mature on loans is when we see if there's anything that needs to happen from a lending
perspective. But I think the Fed is accomplishing what they're trying to do is slow the economy down, bring
inflation down and it's definitely have a net impact.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
That's really helpful, Daryl. Thank you. If I could follow-up, as you continue to take actions to shift more of your
focus to fee income as you reduce the credit risk associated with on-balance sheet CRE. How are you thinking
about your sort of longer term CET1 target before I guess, all the developments of the last several quarters, we're
sort of thinking of M&T being able to get to sort of that 9% CET1 target. But I guess, the inclusion of OCI volatility
and regulatory capital has led to some debate over whether Category 4 banks will now have to run with a little bit
larger buffer versus history? Would appreciate any thoughts there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah, I think as the new rules play out and as we get comfortable working within the rules, you obviously start
with a higher cushion at first. And then as you get used to managing the book and everything, I think we will
tighten it up over time. But my guess is that we probably have a higher buffer coming out of the blocks.
You have to really adjust your investment portfolio since the AFS is going to now go through the regulatory capital
ratios to probably run with shorter durations either outright or invest longer with hedges that bring in the durations
one way or the other, just so you have less volatility there.
So, it's really just getting used to how we manage all that process. But our teams are working on that now and we
will start operating that way probably well before we get the rules actually implemented from that perspective.

Good morning.

Brent Erensel Q
Analyst, Portales Partners
[indiscernible] (00:41:40) If you were to like incrementally invest the capital that you're generating at 7%, you
would generate half the returns that you could by buying back stock. So, you need double-digit returns to equate
that, if that question makes sense. So, the question, I guess, is when -- at what point will the corporate finance
math drive you to resume buybacks?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
So, the corporate finance math is screaming that it's a buy right now. It's really more of our cautious position,
conservative nature that we have to make sure that we have really strong capital, strong liquidity to really weather
what comes our way.
I mean, if the Fed stays higher rates, let's say, for three years or whatever, that could really have a big impact on
the economy. We just want to be really cautious and all that. So, I think we're just trying to be prudent with it. Like
I said earlier, the capital is not going anywhere. We won't -- I promise you we would deploy it in a really
shareholder-friendly manner from that. But right now, we have strong capital, strong liquidity, which has been
really helpful for us since the March-April timeframe, and we will continue to operate and be a strong supporter of
our customers and communities that we serve.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Daryl, over the years, M&T has been very effective in making acquisitions, obviously, the People's deal is the
more recent acquisition that is now completely integrated. And we understand in talking to your peers and others
that the interest rate marks make it very difficult for M&A today.
So I got a two-part question for you. First, just what is your view on M&A for M&T over the next 12 to 24 months of
traditional depositories? And then second, some of the P&C, in particular, was recently bought some assets from
the FDA, I see some loans. Are you guys looking at any assets that might be for sale from the FDIC from the
failed banks that we had earlier in this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. So we didn't do a press release on it, but we did buy two loans from that same purchase P&C did. I think it
was a total of about $300 million in commitments, it was at fund banking. So we did participate in there, and we're
able to get a couple of those loans as well. But we are constantly looking where we can grow our customer base
that are good long-term customers that fit. We just don't want to do asset purchases. We want relationships is
really what we're looking for to drive our organic growth from that.
As it relates to acquisitions, it's just – you and I have been doing this for a long time. When I started, we had
18,000 banks in the early 1980s. Now we're up to about 4,000 banks and it's going to continue to shrink. I think
M&T has a great track record of acquiring bank over time. And that strategy hasn't changed. Our strategy is really
to control and have lots of density in the markets that we serve. So I think if and when we do purchase
acquisitions, it probably won't be a surprise in where we're going and what we're trying to do from that
perspective. So the strategy is there, and it will happen at some point down the road. The interest rates definitely
make it a little bit more challenging now just because the impact on capital. But like anything, things change over
time, and we will be there when we need to and do what we've been really good at before, and we'll continue to
do that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then the second part, a different question as a follow-up. When – M&T, of course, has developed
a reputation as being a very strong underwriter, you got the numbers to prove it. And so we're not necessarily
concerned about what you guys are doing specifically, but we always worry about the competitors doing foolish
and stupid things that then end up having a second derivative effect on your sound underwriting decisions.
Can you frame out for us – granted, I know it's not 2005 and 2006 craziness out there. But are there any concerns
that you see non-bank lenders or other bank lenders doing or have done things in the last 18 to 24 months on the
lending side that make you a little nervous? Or are we just in a new playing field. Everybody is very rational, and
we're not going to see anything really implode because of what some foolish lenders are doing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. We have a long history of working with our clients. Client selection is really huge for us and how we look
and underwrite. So, like in the CRE portfolio, we deal with people that have been in the business for a very long
time that aren't just looking at that real estate investment that they have as an investment for more as a long-term
strategy to their company and their family from that perspective. So I really don't look at trying to get out of the

criticized loans. If somebody is not going to support it, we will probably exit over time. But I don't really view how
we are approaching that. I think it's a great way to develop and keep relationships over the long term. It's the right
way and a fair way to do it. As long as they're willing to support their properties and loans with us from that
perspective.
I think overall, though, I think the industry is much safer than what it has been over the last couple of decades. I
think everybody is trying to do the right thing. We have the benefit that we have some really long-term customers
that have been with M&T for a long period of time, and we try to bank the people that are really top in market in all
the markets that we serve.

Just a follow-up around the loan loss reserve. I know you had talked about the – that the reserve addition was
50% for CRE and half going to C&I. And I'm just trying to frame out like what about the developments in the
quarter drove the need for additional reserve additions beyond what would have already been baked into there
under CECL?
And then separately, can you maybe talk about the likelihood of further reserve build here just as you continue to
dig through the CRE portfolio, I know you said a couple of times that there's ongoing efforts to sift through the
exposures in that book.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. So if you look at the macro factors, our macro factors when we run our allowance models, basically were
pretty steady. Actually, the [indiscernible] (00:49:36) actually improved a little bit. But the other economic statistics
were pretty stable versus the prior period. Really what drove the increase was really softness in some of the asset
values in the CRE portfolio is what we were seeing and thought it made sense to add some more reserves in
those.
As we get more examples of what valuations are that could help drive more or may actually -- I think we feel really
reserved where we are today, but we just want to continue to have a really robust allowance for the needs of our
16

borrowers and make sure we comply with all the rules we have there. But it was really just a little bit of softness in
some valuations.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
And is that softness surprisingly negatively and it's why it's not already in the CECL reserve?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
There's just not a lot of activity going on in some of these markets right now. So you're basically, there's a big
market dislocation. A lot of the marks we're doing as conservative as they are with a net present value cash flow
perspective. And we -- I think I went through it last time, but if something is not leased today, we assume it's not
leased for three years. If something is coming off lease within the next year, we assume that there's a one-year
gap period before it gets released. Those type of cash flow adjustments are kind of what we're marking to, but we
don't have anything to look at. But when you get a certain example, I would say then we can make an adjustment.
Our best sell right now is that there's a lot of money waiting on the sidelines potentially that when the Fed does
decide to keep rates more stable and maybe signal rates going down at some point, I think there will be a lot of
money that will jump back into the system. Right now, there's just not a lot of going on, and there's a very wide
bid-ask spread.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for that. One last follow-up, if I could, also on credit. Your -- I know your charge-off
guidance for the fourth quarter, you expect it to be a low -- above the 29 basis point level for the third quarter and
then full year 2023 near the long-term 33 bps. Can you maybe help us think about what that would imply in terms
of as you look into 2024? Maybe help us -- I know you're not giving formal guidance yet on 2024, but how should
we think about where the loss trajectory could be versus that longer-term 33%? How much above that could it be?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah, that's a good question. For the fourth quarter, it is just our gut feel that it might be higher. It could actually
be the same or lower, to be honest with you right now, but just knowing what's going on right there. It might be
higher, but we really aren't sure about that yet. Next year, we aren't really giving guidance, but from a framework
perspective, our allowance will build when either market economic conditions allow for it or you see some
deterioration in customer behavior from that perspective. But right now, I think we're really on top of what it is, any
areas that we potentially could have risk in our credit teams are all over it, looking at the reviews and the analysis
that we have. And right now, we feel that our reserve is adequate, and then we're in good touch with where the
risks are.
