President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Good morning. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. Looking at performance in the fourth
quarter, key success measures like net interest income growth, tangible book value creation, core loan growth,
core deposit growth, asset quality, all continue to be strong. There is a fair amount of noise in our fourth quarter
numbers, so we're going to move quickly to the performance detail for the fourth quarter to try to create clarity
there, then an outlook for 2023 to help the model builders, and finally, I'll spend some time detailing why I believe
we have a unique ability to continue producing outsized shareholder value.
As you likely know, we believe the asset quality, revenue growth, earnings per share growth, and tangible book
value accretion result in long term shareholder returns. That's where our incentives are linked to and that's why
we show this dashboard every single quarter where you can see the relentless upward flow of those metrics most
closely tied to the shareholder returns.
GAAP measures first, followed by the non-GAAP measures, which I'm partially most focused on. And if you
believe that asset quality, revenue growth, earnings per share growth, and tangible book value accretion most
influence shareholder returns, which I do, then you have to appreciate the persistent excellent performance
against those variables year in and year out.
As I mentioned a minute ago, there is considerable noise in our fourth quarter financials, so we're anxious to get
on with those details. The most impactful of those items would be BHG's election [ph] to fund (00:04:05) roughly
$500 million in originations on their balance sheet, thereby deferring the income on those loans over the life of
loans as opposed to dragging them into their auction platform, which would have resulted in taking the gain on
sale upfront, significantly increasing their and our earnings during the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, I believe you
should be able to look through to see that the core banking business continues to have great momentum.
So, Harold, let's move on and let's walk through the quarter.

Thanks, Terry. Good morning, everybody. As usual, we'll start with loans. The fourth quarter was another strong
loan growth quarter for us and we believe annualized mid-teens loan growth going into 2023 is reasonable for us.
As we anticipate loan growth – loan yield growth in the fourth quarter and we anticipate further escalation in loan
yields in the first quarter, along with that, we are forecasting increases of 25 basis points in February and 25 basis
points in March. Our modeling indicates that loan yield will be up 40 basis points to 50 basis points or so in the
third quarter.
The talent we've had over the last several years results in extraordinary balance sheet momentum as we've done
over the past few quarters. We're again dissecting that loan growth based on categories [ph] noted on the side
(00:05:20) to help everyone better understand the source of our growth. It's been a huge year for us as far as loan
growth is concerned and it works out with the new markets and the new hires contributed to more than half of our
growth. That said, that represents more than just an annuity stream for interest income, those are new clients with

now new opportunities for [ph] our all (00:05:38) types of financial products. We're definitely in a broader footprint
with new markets, but also a much deeper footprint given our model.
Now, deposits, really pleased to report the growth in deposits for the fourth quarter. Growing deposits at a
reasonable price in 2023 is a key focus for our [ph] current environment (00:05:57). We are actively building our
deposit gathering franchises around HSA community housing associations, non-profits, and others, and we
believe we're making headway with these and other special deposit initiatives.
Our average deposit costs came in heavier at 74-basis point increase over the third quarter. Although we believe
we remain inside our total deposit beta guidance of 40% through the end of 2022, we experienced an acceleration
in the deposit costs in the fourth quarter above our expectations by about 15 basis points. Competitive pressures
around deposit costs are significant, so we fully anticipate that increases in the Fed rates will continue to add a
tailwind for increased deposit costs in 2023. Average deposit costs, we believe, may approach [ph] 1.9%
(00:06:47) to 2% in the first quarter of this year.
As for mix, we are seeing deposit move more on non-interest bearing and lower-yielding interest accounts with
the higher interest products and time deposits. Our average non-interest-bearing deposits were down
approximately $440 million in the quarter from 3Q averages and even more based on the end-of-period balances.
Our plan will contemplate this decrease to continue at a lesser pace in the first half of 2023.
About 90% of our non-interest-bearing balances are commercial with approximately 25% of that number being
annualized. Over the last year, annualized commercial has dropped from around $425,000 per account to around
$350,000, while non-annualized commercial has dropped from $35,000 to $30,000. Pre-COVID levels would be
around $300,000 for annualized and a little less than $25,000 for non-annualized. So, average account size is still
10% or so higher than pre-COVID levels.
Our number one objective remains developing strategies and tactics around funding our growth. We continue to
like our chances given the significant investment we've made in both the relationship managers and new markets
over the last few years. Hopefully, you'll not hear this bank's leadership ever talk about having too many deposits.
Our belief is that we have and will fund our deposit growth effectively and prudently, maintain the appropriate
balance between profitability and growth.
Now, liquidity. We believe we have ample liquidity to fund our near-term growth. As for investment securities, our
allocation of bonds was flattish in the quarter. We don't anticipate any significant growth in bonds this year, as the
top left chart reflects our GAAP NIM increased by 13 basis points compared to 28 and 30 basis points in the
previous two quarters.
As we've mentioned last time, a decrease in our NIM expansion was not unexpected, although we felt like the
NIM will expand in the fourth quarter by a few more basis points than it did. Our planning assumption is that our
NIM will likely be flat to down next year and likely down in the first quarter given the first quarter is burdened by
fewer days. That said, our growth model should provide for increases in net interest income. As we enter 2023,
we believe net interest income guidance with a high-teens percentage growth for 2023 over 2022 is reasonable at
this time.
As for credit, we're again presenting our traditional credit metrics. Pinnacle's loan portfolio continues to perform
very well. Our current ACL is 1.04% while – which again compares to pre-CECL, pre-COVID reserve OF 48 basis
points at the end of 2019. We did modify our CECL model in this quarter with a more pessimistic assumption set
with a baseline of 20%, stagflation of 30%, and the pessimistic scenario at 50%. We continue to have

conversations with borrowers about supply chain, inflation and how it's affecting their businesses. We've been all
about sustainable credit diligence efforts with the intent to actively identify any weaknesses in our borrowings.
We continue to have a very limited appetite for new construction, whether it be residential or commercial. Thus,
the growth of our construction portfolio is limited to funding previously approved commitments with no new
projects being added at least through the first quarter of 2023. We also remain attentive to our concentration limits
in all areas of our portfolio, particularly in CRE, as the table in the bottom right of the slide details. No changes
regarding our CRE appetite from the last quarter. In summary, our outlook for credit remains strong as we entered
2023 from a position of strength. So if negative trends begin to develop, we believe we're advantaged.
Now on the fees, and as always, I'll speak to BHG in a few minutes. Excluding the ESG, fee revenues were
flattish for the third quarter. All that said, we're pleased with the effort of our fee-generating units are putting forth
as several units are negatively impacted by the current operating environment in a meaningful way. Obviously,
residential mortgage volumes were down this year. Mortgage [ph] is dusty (00:10:53). Their pipeline is building
back modestly in the first quarter as rates hopefully will be less volatile when the spring home buying season
begin. Gains on SBA loan sales are also down significantly from the third quarter, as their business was impacted
by the elimination of incentives from the CARES Act, which drove more business to SBA lenders in previous
quarter.
We've got a few questions on earnings credit rates and the impact on deposit fees. So here's a stab at that. We
have approximately $2.5 billion in annualized commercial noninterest-bearing accounts. Our current ECR is
around 35 basis points, which we feel is competitive. At the moment, our run rate on analysis fees with waivers is
about $4.5 million per quarter. For every 25 basis points we raised the ECR, that reduces our analysis fee by
$400,000 to $500,000 each quarter. Our goal is to stay in the middle of our competition peer group on earnings
credit rates, so we have to [indiscernible] (00:11:50) the ECR that's coming, but it will come on small [ph] bites
(00:11:54).
We anticipated 2022 to return to high single-digit growth in fees over 2021. Excluding BHG and other non-equity
investments, we believe growth – we achieved 5% growth for the year. We think mortgage should recover
modestly in 2023, and we've also added some strong revenue producers in wealth management late in 2022.
Excluding BHG and the impact of other equity investment, we believe that high-single-digit to low-teens growth in
2023 over 2022 is reasonable.
Expenses came in about where we thought for the quarter. We did see non-compensation expense declined from
4Q – in 4Q from 3Q, but attributable to the reversal of some franchise tax accruals with some of that being added
to the tax line, so it was a reclassification between franchise tax expense and income tax expense. All in, we are
anticipating effective tax rate of approximately 20% in 2023.
Our incentive costs also decreased in 4Q from 3Q. This was primarily the result of the impact of 4Q 2022 PPNR
results on a cash plan, which came in below target; and overall performance metrics on a performance-based
equity incentive awards, which came in below our expectations. All of this is a segue in a few comments about
variable cost nature of our expense base. We feel like our expense base should result in mid-teens growth for
2023 over 2022.
As to how we can manage expenses, as I mentioned, we reduced our 2022 [indiscernible] (00:13:27) achieving
selected incentive targets, particularly in our quarterly PPNR targets and various other managements when it
comes to equity compensation, which is, by the way, primarily impacts senior leadership. That's how it works. Our
cash incentive plan was always tied to EPS growth targets, and for 2022, it was also tied to PPNR target for each

quarter. We missed our fourth quarter PPNR target, thus incentives were reduced. Our leadership equity plans
were tied [ph] to results (00:13:54) in relation to our peers, some are return on tangible common equity, some are
tangible book value accretion, some are PE and tangible book value [ph] models (00:14:01).
So, it's all based on ranking in relation to our peers that [ph] primarily (00:14:05) that we think are directly linked to
shareholder value. The higher the peer ranking, the better we [ph] do (00:14:05). We believe we have a very
shareholder-friendly compensation system that is objective, not subjective, which is a meaningful variable cost
component.
The other elements that bring the variable costs attribute to our expense growth is our hiring model. We can
always back down [ph] on our recruiting (00:14:28) and have done it a few times in our history. I can recall once
during the financial crisis and the other at the start of COVID. Both times we slowed recruiting until better
understood the depth of the macro environment. Lastly, and as we mentioned in the press release, we've got the
ability to modify, cancel or postpone various events and projects, [ph] and absolutely we'll do (00:14:48), should
our targets be in jeopardy of not being achieved.
On the capital, tangible book value per common share increased to $44.74 at quarter end, up slightly from the last
quarter. Our capital ratios remain above well-capitalized level. We like our tangible common equity ratio, which
stands at 8.5% currently. We are mindful of our Tier 2 capital levels, particular at Pinnacle Bank. We'll be
monitoring out capital levels as we get into 2023. We believe the actions we've taken preserved the annual book
value and our tangible capital ratio has served as well and have no plans currently to alter our PNFP Tier 1 capital
stack via any sort of common [ph] or preferred offer (00:15:29).
Now, a few comments about BHG before we look at the outlook for the rest of the year. As the slide indicates,
BHG had another great quarter on originations, second best in its history. Originations did decrease from prior
quarter with BHG's implementation of a tighter credit mark, so fewer of the lower credit score loans, which are
typically more profitable, were funded in the fourth quarter. As a result, spreads did come [ph] in (00:15:56) from
the last quarter from 9.7% to 8.9% as the chart on the bottom left indicates. That's more spread shrinkage than
originally planned. But as the chart indicate for several quarters in 2020, current spreads remain above or near
historical norms.
The accrual for loan substitutions and prepayments increased from 5.66% to 5.28% last quarter as a result of a
more precautionary posture of BHG management. BHG's accrual for loan substitution and prepayments for a sole
loan portfolio increased from $207 million at September 30 to $314 million at December 31.
As the blue bars on the bottom right chart show, recourse losses fell slightly from 4% to 3.96% at year-end.
Additionally, given the macro environment and as we mentioned last quarter, BHG also increased on-balance
sheet reserve for loan losses to $147 million or 4.59% of its on-balance sheet loans from 3.53% last quarter. Of
course, CECL is still on the radar for adoption on October 1, 2023. We continue to anticipate the CECL reserve to
be 8% to 9%, but that certainly is an estimate at this point.
The quality of BHG's borrowing base, in our opinion, remains impressive. As mentioned earlier, BHG has modified
its credit mark, particularly with respect to lower tranches of its borrowing base. This will have an impact on both
production and spreads going forward. BHG refreshes its credit score monthly, always looking for indications of
weakness in its borrowing base. Credit scores were at a consistent level with previous quarters, so their
borrowers have remained resilient during the cycle thus far. In comparison to other consumer lenders, we believe
BHG borrowers remain well-compensated with average borrower earnings being around $293,000 annually.

BHG's trailing 12-month charge-off ratio has increased from 1.98% to 2.94%. Similarly, its delinquency ratio has
increased from 1.22% to 1.78%. Although, these ratios are in line with early 2021 ratios, BHG recognizes the
macro environment could lead to further deterioration of similar credits. In an effort to keep performance near
historical levels, BHG has made a number of credit cuts to both our marketing and underwriting models. We
believe that BHG's management team has taken a proactive approach to managing credit as they've entered
2023.
Lastly, BHG had another great year in 2022. As I mentioned during our earnings calls this year, we have always
believed BHG's earnings in the first half of 2022 would likely to be stronger than the second half, as they set more
loans to the bank auction platform in the first half of the year rather than [ph] hold (00:18:53) loans in their balance
sheet. And as you know, the bank auction platform delivers [indiscernible] (00:18:58) while loans that they
retained on the balance sheet and fund through various funding options deliver interest income over the life of the
loan.
BHG accomplished three securitization this year, aggregating almost $1.3 billion in volume. During the last month
of December, they added $550 million in new facility with Goldman and Truist. This represents incremental
funding available to BHG in 2023. A third facility for $500 million was closed in late December as well. Closing of
this facility required more loans to remain on balance sheet than we, otherwise, had been expecting. This facility
was fully funded at year end 2022. So, here's a simple example. A $100 million issuance through the bank auction
platform could generate anywhere from $30 million to $40 million in gains immediately, while going through the
securitization platform at an 8% spread would yield approximately $7 million to $8 million in interest income
annually. In the fourth quarter, BHG [indiscernible] (00:20:04).
Again, looking forward, some key points I'd like to re-emphasize which are basically the same comments I
mentioned three months ago. BHG management has responded to the macro environment in a very real way.
BHG is and will be increasing reserve based on macroeconomic data at least over the next few quarters. BHG
has been modifying their [indiscernible] (00:20:32) towards originating less risky assets with the aspiration
[indiscernible] (00:20:36) 2023.
Production volumes are strong, and we believe they will maintain production levels going into 2023. BHG's new
funding alternatives will grow their already strong liquidity platforms which we also believe is unmatched by their
peers. Lastly, a few weeks ago, BHG took steps to limit its head count with job eliminations and eliminations of
most open positions, as well as other expense reductions which should yield a 10% reduction in its expense burn
in 2023 [indiscernible] (00:21:16) we have great confidence in our partners at Bankers Healthcare Group to
deliver strong results over the long-term.
Quickly, here's our final initial outlook for 2023, along with the comparison of our comments on 2022, the third
quarter conference call in October. We expect mid-teens in loans; low to mid-teens growth in deposit. This
correlates to a similar outlook for net interest income, which should result [indiscernible] (00:21:49) high-teens
growth in net interest income. Our plan for 2023 contemplates our NIM being flat to down for the year. This will
also be a challenge and we'll need be nimble [indiscernible] (00:21:55).
Fee revenues may be our biggest challenge as many [indiscernible] (00:22:03) are facing more than their fair
share of economic headwind. While we've had some key hires on several of these areas and are optimistic that
we should see a lift from those new associates, we believe BHG target will be flat to slightly up for 2023. We've
reduced our expense growth outlook to mid-teens. Our senior leaders are still committed to a strong recruiting
year, especially [indiscernible] (00:22:27).

Asset quality [indiscernible] (00:22:28) great shape early and we believe we're entering the year from a position of
strength, which should be a great thing should the negative trends begin to develop. We're putting the final
touches on our strategic and financial plans for 2023 with just as many unknowns now as there were last year, but
our goal remains the same: top quartile earnings performance no matter what [ph] gets thrown to us (00:22:49).
With that, I will turn it back over to Terry.

All right. Thank you, Harold. There's two things that I hate and I know most of you do as well. One is noise in the
numbers. In my opinion, noise just forces the discussion to be around trying to create clarity about the noise, and
takes the focus off the underlying ability to produce outsized shareholder returns, which [indiscernible] (00:23:11)
the focus should be. The second thing I hate is the economic uncertainty [indiscernible] (00:23:16) forces
investors to the sidelines regardless of the potential for shareholder value creation.
And so, I will take just a minute to [indiscernible] (00:23:24) how we intend to produce outsized shareholder
returns regardless of whether [indiscernible] (00:23:30) balance sheet more loans, regardless of the economic
uncertainties that persist, come what may. It's not lost on any one on this call that there's a broad sentiment that
we're headed into a difficult economic landscape. Greenwich [indiscernible] (00:23:44) commercial executives as
to their view of the direction of the economy going forward. Their optimism index is simply a net score of the
positives less the negatives. And as you can see here, commercial executives has not been so pessimistic since
the Great Recession.
The economic headwinds [indiscernible] (00:24:00) commercial banks are widely known, and include a shrinking
money supply, which means a shrinking deposit pool; increased rate base competition for deposits; an inverted
yield curve; inflation and, ultimately, a recession, just to name a few. And there is no doubt that the banking
business is subject to the economic environment, but our growth model is more a function of our ability to take
both talent and market share, and therefore, is substantially less dependent on short-term interest rate
movements, inflation ups and downs, and those kinds of things.
And we literally have been pursuing this model for 23 years. So, frankly, it's just hard for me to understand how
our competitors who have not been building this differentiation can either catch up or defend against it. It is the
classic sustainable advantage. Beginning with the far right, the objective is total shareholder returns. Here, you
can see the dramatic outperformance over the last 10 years.
Generally, that would be true if you looked at our first 10 years of existence. True if you looked at our 17 years of
existence. True if you looked at our first 20 years of existence. And while past results are no guarantees of future
performance, I believe it will be true over the next 10 years. Because this model is intended to produce value
through thick and thin over the long-term.
The reason I say that is because we built a demonstrably different client experience. Everybody says they give
great service. In our case, it's our clients who say that, and they tell that to the independent researches that
compares data not only for Pinnacle but for, virtually, all our competitors. You can see in the center of the chart
that our client engagement with this firm is literally unparalleled. [indiscernible] (00:25:49) that differentiated
service is largely contingent on our ability to excite and engage our associates.
I'm not going to read you the list; but said simply, in 2022, we've been rated as the best place to work in virtually
every market we operate in. And on a national scale, we've been ranked as the second best workplace for women

and the seventh best workplace for millennials in the country. We excite and engage our associates. So, it's just
hard for me to imagine that competitors who've not been building this over an extended period of time will be very
successful, either taking our associates and clients or stopping us from taking theirs.
Moving on to the advantaged markets, using United Van Lines National Movers Study, the Southeast continues to
attract people all over the country. I challenge you to find a bank with a more advantaged footprint than ours in
terms of population migration and growth. And then, as it relates to our chosen footprint, we operate in the vast,
vast majority of the large, high-growth urban markets. So, we're located in the most advantaged region of the
country; and within that region, we're generally located in the largest and fastest growing cities.
Moving beyond the incredibly attractive size and growth dynamics of our markets, frankly, the more important
traction is the competitive landscape. Given the Net Promoter Score is the best indicator of a bank's ability to
protect or expand market share, beginning on the left, according to Greenwich's national study, despite all their
investments in technology, you can see scores are horribly low for the national franchises; slightly better but
declining at the super-regionals; and not surprisingly better, but declining in community banks.
Moving to the right, you can see the Pinnacle scores are unmatched and getting better. I fully expect that gap to
widen as the industry adopts the work-from-home platform while we operate a work-from-office platform, primarily
for the purpose of further differentiating our service levels [indiscernible] (00:27:46) that's what we'll do. Keep in
mind that Net Promoter Score measure requires willingness to reprimand, so that's how you continue to grow
safely in the face of a declining economy.
And speaking of the competitive vulnerabilities, never in our existence I remember a time when the banks that
have the bulk of the share in our markets were more likely to give it up than now. Here's a smattering of recent
headlines in our markets regarding our competitors. [indiscernible] (00:28:12) crystallize the sustainability of our
ongoing market share taking for both associates and clients. And here's further demonstration of our win in the
war for talent, and I believe we've become the employer of choice for bankers that are the frustrated with the large
bank employers in our markets. It seems like every year we set a new record for hiring many of the most
experienced and successful revenue producers in our markets from those banks that still have the largest market
shares.
And when they work in a company that despises bureaucracy and is universally focused [indiscernible] (00:28:46)
clients, these revenue producers create literally the best experience in the market. Not to belabor the point, but
the three banks on the left of that chart are the market share leaders. So, how could you expect anything from us
but rapid growth over the long-term, completely agnostic to economic conditions, when you recognize that those
banks are where most of our revenue producers come from and you see the differentiated service that they're
now able to provide.
Here's another way to visualize that opportunity. Banks above the crosshairs have share dominance. Banks to the
left of the crosshairs are least successful engaging their clients. They're vulnerable. Of course, banks to the right
of the crosshairs are most successful in engaging their clients and best positioned to capitalize on those
competitive vulnerabilities, PNFP being the most advantaged against the market share leaders, all of whom look
vulnerable.
Much has been written about the competitive advantage that's being created by the tech spend of the nation's
largest banks, and in Greenwich's study of the national franchise, as you can see, sure enough, there's a strong
correlation between client's perceptions of a bank's digital capabilities and a client's willingness to add them as a

bank provider. But according to Greenwich, in our markets, the best overall digital experience is being provided by
Pinnacle, the best product capabilities, the best service professionals, the best overall experience.
Thinking about long-term shareholder value creation, Greenwich research has long highlighted the three pillars on
client loyalty is built: number one, value long-term relationship; number two, ease of doing business; number
three, a bank you can trust. Over the last couple of years, they've actually expanded to a fourth pillar, which is
data and analytics-driven insights, a key area of investment, again, for those largest competitors. But, again, in
our markets, we dominate all four of those metrics, further indication that our net growth to clients is likely to
continue.
And now trying to connect the dots, I recognize to many the associate engagement, client service add little to no
bearing on earnings and shareholder returns. Some view those things as expenses to be cut, but hopefully this
slide can connect the dots for you on why we believe our growth should be insulated from economic conditions.
Because of the people we hire and the service we give, very few client would consider leaving and a great many
intend to add us a provider [indiscernible] (00:31:24).
As you scan up and down on those net momentum percentages for the banks in our market, irrespective of
economic conditions, our net momentum is huge. In the case of small businesses, more than twice as much as
the next best competitor; and in the case of the middle market, total dominance, particularly when you compare to
the market share leaders, the top three banks on both of those charts.
Without understanding our unique approach to penetrating the market, largely by hiring experienced bankers,
enabling them to be easy to do business with, [indiscernible] (00:31:59) draw a conclusion that if it's growing like a
weed, it is one. So many of our competitors are out prospecting for new clients by circulating [indiscernible]
(00:32:05) list or some other prospect list [indiscernible] (00:32:07) to borrow money. I would say, even slow
growers, that's typically how it's done.
And you can see here, according to Greenwich, we're dead last in prospect calling. As previously discussed,
we're not out trying to meet clients to loan money to; we're simply supporting our relationship managers and
calling on the clients that they've known and banked many times for decades. We believe that strategy provides
us with better protection than our peers in the event credit turns.
So, Q4 was a noisy quarter. Economic uncertainties abound. My encouragement is to keep the [indiscernible]
(00:32:49). As it relates to BHG, the fundamentals remain strong. Originations were the second highest in their
history. They've restored their loan book and score has not deteriorated, again, and gaining strength in the loan
book. They continue to add liquidity sources and utilize those liquidity resources mainly from some of the most
sophisticated investors in the market.
And at the end of the day, nearly $300 million in pre-tax earnings, 22% grow over prior year; it's an incredible
story and continues to be a handsome asset. Beyond that and I think this is most important to me, we run a core
banking franchise that continues to dominate, continues to have momentum, regardless of what the
circumstances are. We compete in the advantaged Southeastern footprint. We have a cultural focus that results in
a differentiated client experience, and there is no more sustainable advantage than that.
Our organic growth model [indiscernible] (00:33:55) that resonates throughout our markets. One of the best loan
growth stories in the US. One of the best tangible book value growers in the country. From a credit perspective,
we're top quartile in terms of NPA-to-loans and [ph] OREO (00:34:08). Clearly, the place you want to start when
credit does turn.

And then lastly, I would just hit on this idea that Harold has talked about a little bit. But I think an important
consideration as people begin to focus on how do we get the 2023 estimates set, has to do with our
compensation systems, how those goals are set, particularly as it relates to leadership compensation.
Specifically, those incentive plans focus on tangible book value generation. May give you some insights on why
our tangible book value grew [indiscernible] (00:34:42) versus peers in 2022 with the peer relative target setting.
So, we have to outrun the peers. As Harold has indicated, we're looking for top quartile performance on things like
EPS and revenue growth in 2023.
As many of you trying to develop those 2023 estimates, maybe you can go to school a little bit on 2022. And all I
mean by that is if you think back to 2022, generally, the outlook for the industry as a whole was that there would
be negative earnings growth in 2022. [indiscernible] (00:35:21) recall, most believed that the industry didn't have
sufficient momentum to [indiscernible] (00:35:23) of PPP income.
But I will say this, obviously, this information ends up in our proxy, but regardless of what those [indiscernible]
(00:35:32) are, we still targeted top quartile growth, which was not negative. And we bet my incentive, Harold's
incentives, and the incentives of the roughly 3,000 salary-based employees of this company on that idea. That's
been our methodology from the start. That continues to be our methodology. And so, if you think through that, you
get some insight into our belief about the momentum in the core banking franchise in order to get that done.
So, I'll stop there and we'll be glad to take questions.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Good morning, guys. Thank you. Maybe just starting on margin in the guidance. Harold, when you're saying it's
down, should we assume that's down from fourth quarter's 3.60%, or the full year over full year should be slightly
down?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. We believe that it would be flat to down from the fourth quarter. We think the first quarter is going to be
probably penalized more because it just has fewer number of days. But we believe it could be 3 to 5 basis points,
something like that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then when we look at the asset sensitivity disclosure, it looks like you became more asset sensitive in
fourth quarter. So, is this just you anticipate increased acceleration of deposit funding pressure, I'm assuming
here?

Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I mean we are planning to still see rates increase here in the near-term. We think our deposit beta might
level off at somewhere around 45% by mid-year, maybe a little more to that by mid-year. Yeah.

Jared Shaw Q

Okay. All right. Thanks for that. And on BHG, what are some of the assumptions you have for provision in 2023
with the weakening credit backdrop? And how sensitive is your BHG outlook to the provision?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. That's a great question. They plan on not nearly as significant of increases in their provisioning or their
reserves going forward. So, I think they've gotten the bulk of it done here this quarter. But they'll just have to
monitor what pass-throughs are looking like, what charge-offs are looking like to see if they can stay within that
guidance.

line is live.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thanks. Good morning, guys. I think, Terry and Harold, you guys have said you spend NII, you don't spend the
NIM. But obviously, some of the optics around the deposit betas can be tough. You guys laid out a really good
slide, I think, in second quarter kind of showing you guys have traditionally had higher betas, but also higher NII
growth.
Is there anything today within the balance sheet that makes you think moving forward will be any different;
whether that'd be funding mix, the reduction in noninterest-bearing deposits, the scale of funding pressures? Or
do you think that's the story that will continue to play out that, yeah, we'll have higher betas, but we'll also have
this better NII growth resulting in better earnings over time?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, for sure. We're talking about high teens growth in net interest income this year and with a margin that could
be flat to down. But that thesis is how we operate. So, several years ago, I remember on a call, somebody asked
a question about how we're going to deal with this [indiscernible] (00:40:32) margin. And that was back when it
was down around 2.50% or so. So, there is a point where our pricing and our margins get too low for us to live
with, and we have to adjust. But as we sit right now, our growth engine appears more than capable of providing
significant net interest income growth with this, some might say, a higher deposit beta.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. And within that composition, Harold, you mentioned some other niche kind of verticals. And I noticed
it appeared in the slide deck that indexed deposits jumped maybe to 17.2% of deposits from like 11.3%. Were
there any meaningful changes there in terms of products or verticals there that drove that increase?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think most of that would be public funds. We've attracted some public fund clients here locally as well as
in Washington. And I think most of those are tied to some kind of index.

Stephen Kendall Scouten Q

Okay. And then just last thing from me, just on that share repurchase, the $125 million plan as well as you noted a
potential sub-debt rate. Can you give us an idea about how you're thinking about that into 2023? How aggressive
you might plan to be, and what the size of a potential sub-debt raise might look like?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A

Yeah. I mean, we've modeled out a couple hundred million to $300 million. Right now, we think we can step
through the year without any kind of need to go out and raise sub-debt, but we'll just have to see how that plays
out, how loan growth performs, all that.

Steven Alexopoulos Q

I want to start on expenses. So if the revenue environment proves to be worse than expected, could you walk us
through which levers would you expect to pull early on, right? What's like first to go, last to go; and how quickly
could you throttle down expense levels if needed?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. There are several things that we can respond to fairly quickly. One is, if Terry believes the kind of the
revenue number appears to be kind of – will be consistent for the year, then, like we've done in the past, we can
always reduce our hiring profile or our hiring plans for the year. We also anticipate what the payout is going to be
on the incentive plans. So, those accruals would also come down. And then, we've got plans for various events
throughout the year that could get on the table for complete elimination or reduction or whatever.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2023
So this year, I think, given what's going on here today and what we reported in earnings, I think there's going to
be an intense focus on not only expenses, but revenue growth, pricing, all of that by this management group to
make sure that we achieve our targets this year. Terry has allocated time in his senior level meeting to review
those kind of things. And so, I think our firm, particularly, our senior leadership, is committed to hitting our targets
and doing whatever we need to do to accomplish that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Hey, Steven. I might just tag on there a little bit, maybe not exactly what you asked, but I think some color related
topic. As you know, in terms of annual cash incentive plan, [indiscernible] (00:44:26) threshold. We can't make
bad loans and win. Assume we clear that, most of our existence, the two variables that determine the payout are
earnings per share growth and revenue growth that was required to hit that earnings per share growth.
And last year, we looked at PPNR and I guess for a year or two, you're in a difficult period where allowances are
being built and those kind of things. We relied on PPNR [indiscernible] (00:44:56). Our board has not technically
approved the comp plan. They'll do that here in the next few weeks, in a February meeting. But then, anticipation
is that they'll go back to performance variables, being earnings per share growth and revenue growth.
And, so anyway, I'm just putting that in perspective. I get it, you're asking about expenses. But it does create a
great focus on getting the revenues generated, which drives up the odds of success there. And secondarily, the
earnings, if we're not hitting that revenue growth, there is plenty of focus on it. We will get in here and start
working in a different way on the expenses.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. That's helpful. If I could change to the margin, to follow up on your answer to Jared's question and all
the commentary you gave about the competitive environment for deposits. Harold, how should we think about the
trajectory for NIM? How are you thinking about it here? I think you said down 3 to 5 basis points in the first
quarter. But do you think it's slow and steady declines through the year? Do you think we bottom out the first half,
recover in the second half? How are you thinking about that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Well, as far as the rate increases and their impact on our margin, we think they will have kind of
[indiscernible] (00:46:10) some of the reduction in our margins. So, in all the likelihood, Steve, the margin is
probably going to just kind of rotate around this 3.55% to, call it, 3.60% number, we believe, all year long. If
funding pressures and we're not able to hit our deposit targets, then obviously, that's going to impact that
assertion. But as it sits right now, we believe there's just going to be [indiscernible] (00:46:44) kind of be in that
3.55% to 3.60% range.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Got you. That's helpful. And then finally, on BHG, if we look at the prior expectations for 2023 versus what
you're coming out with now where it's a reduced outlook for the contribution, doesn't sound like that's related to
you anticipating higher provisions at BHG. Is this all related to them just holding more production in portfolio? Is
that really what's driving this, or is there something else?

Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
So, I think, there will be year-over-year more credit cost related to provisioning, of some, call it, 10% to 20%. But
they intend to probably back off some of their balance sheeting and send more money through the auction
platform this year. They think they're going to have to do that with the elimination of these lower tiers, these higher
credit – I mean, lower credit scored accounts in order to hit their revenue numbers for this year. So, I think they'll
sell more to the auction platform and I think they'll also be still adding more money to the reserves, but not at the
same pace that they did in the fourth quarter.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Harold, I think last quarter you talked about a cumulative
deposit beta somewhere in the 60% range and you kind of estimated 40% by the end of this year which would
kind of add. Any changes to that, just given the competitive pressure for that longer-term cumulative beta? And if
the Fed does stay higher for longer, does that impact that? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I don't know. I've not really thought about or put any kind of math to what deposit costs could look like at
the end of 2023 as far as beta calculations and into 2024. We've kind of talked about beta through the middle of
the year of somewhere between 45% to 50%, given the two rate hikes here in the near-term. So, I'm not really
[indiscernible] (00:49:12) kind of looked at what the longer-term deposit beta.
But what we fully expect that once the Fed stop raising rates that you're likely to see deposit rate creep just due to
competitive pressures. So, I don't know how long we will talk about deposit betas, but I think when you get into the
latter part of the year and, like you said, Michael, assuming the Fed [indiscernible] (00:49:40) higher rate
environment for a longer period of time, that we fully anticipate that deposit ratio will continue to be pretty normal
in a kind of a flat rate environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Thanks for the color. And maybe just one separate follow-up question. Just wanted to kind of revisit where
you guys are in terms of the BHG investment. Obviously, it's done a lot of great things for you all over the years.
And I know you've kind of maybe hinted at maybe reducing the stake at some point in the future. But I just want to
– just given where the earnings contribution is and expected to be over the next year, it's obviously going to be
lower than it has in the past. Any sort of strategic thought as we kind of move over the next short- to intermediate-
term and how you guys view that business, and what the longer-term strategic rationale of the investment is for
you? Thanks.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2023
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I'll start and Terry can add his comments. First of all, I want to say that the partnership between us and
BHG is strong. Matter of fact, I'll have a board meeting with the BHG folks here in about a couple of hours. But the
valuation of Bankers Healthcare Group, we understand, we realize, we believe is kind of a part of the barricades
on our shares, and trying to figure out what that number is important. But absent an [indiscernible] (00:51:16)
transaction, it's difficult to discern.
That said, I think we and BHG are on the same page. There are, there have been opportunities to reduce our
stake; but, right now, the pricing is just not, we believe, at a point where that makes it worthwhile for us. We think
it's a valuable asset. We think it has created quite a bit of earnings momentum for us. We think BHG, on another
day, could be worth quite a bit of money. All that said, our opinion about BHG is that a lesser ownership interest
by ourselves probably wouldn't be that bad, and we should consider any kind of worthwhile transaction that does
that careful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think, Michael, maybe just to echo Harold's comments, you started with the right assumption. I think what
I'd outright say is that if nobody has to be happy, we would like to reduce our dependence on BHG as a function
of our earnings stream, not because we're not bullish on the company and not because of any reason other than it
just has become where investor conversations, investor outlooks, and so forth, it's just hard to keep telling the
story that so many people either disagree with or don't understand. And so, again, at least for me from a stake
standpoint, I would like to have less dependence on BHG as a function of my earnings stream.
I think to Harold's point, I think we'd be good with that. I think BHG would be good with that. I think there are –
there always are or almost always are a number of people who have interest to pursue ownership interest in
BHG. And so then, the question just comes down to what's the price? And so if we find the right price in there, I
think we would have expressed preference to lighten our load some. If we don't find the right price [indiscernible]
(00:53:42) the investment and what it does for our company, and that fuels our ongoing growth.
And so, again, the worst case is a good case; but, again, just to be clear, at the right price, we would certainly
lighten our exposure to BHG as a function of our earnings stream.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2023
Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. A question on the fee guide ex-BHG. Just wondering what are the drivers?
Because just to get to the low end of the guide implies kind of a mid-teens growth from the current run rate on
average to hit the low end of that guide in 2023. Just wondering what the drivers are?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think mortgage is going to be impactful. They had a big hit in the fourth quarter because of valuation of the
hedge. Their pipeline is down to the lowest level it's been at in, I don't know, seven or eight years, basically. But
the actual size of the pipeline drives the valuation of that hedge. And so, we think we're going to at least have that
tailwind going into the, call it, the early part of 2023 into the spring.
We've also hired a meaningful number of wealth management people, and we're particularly interested in a few
that have been at this for decades. Their client base is broad, well-supported. So, we anticipate some pretty
significant revenue bumps from that. As we've also mentioned, we are targeting quite a bit of commercial
accounts. And so with that, we believe we've got both annualized fees and [indiscernible] (00:55:51) non-
annualized fees that we commented. So, that's kind of where that high-single-digit number comes from, from
primarily in those areas.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Understood. And then [indiscernible] (00:56:08) on BHG. Just wondering what kind of spread you guys are
assuming, just given the bank buy rate has increased and that spread has kind of come in – does the guide for
2023 assume that, that spread holds; or is there a little bit of deterioration in there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A

Spread that I'm looking at for them for next year is 8.5% to 9%, something like that.

Okay. Very good. And then just last one from me. I know it's tricky, but the noninterest-bearing deposits settling

Yeah. That's a great question. And you need to kind of have a crystal ball to figure it out. But the best data that we
have that we've looked at is when we start looking at average account sizes and what they were pre-COVID to
what they are now. And so, it could be anywhere from, call it, 5% or so [indiscernible] (00:57:31) of that. But our
planning assumption is somewhere around that.

Operator: Thank you. And the next question is coming from Matt Olney from Stephens, Inc. Matt, your line is
live.
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey, thanks. Good morning. And first question for Harold. With Michael Rose's earlier question, you mentioned a
flat rate environment and what this means for the margin. But what if the Fed starts to cut its Fed funds rate, what
are some incremental levers you guys could pull to help protect the margin and the NII?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Well, we have entered into a couple of swap transactions for about, well, there's actually four of them that
we've entered into for about $2 billion in coverage over the loan book at somewhere around, call it, 4.25%. So, we
do have that. I think the biggest thing we've got is, first of all, we've mentioned we've got an increase in indexed
accounts. So, those will come down. But the other thing we've got is a relationship-based business where we
think we've been pretty good at being fair with clients.
And so, what happened last time in a rate-down environment is we were also pretty fair on the way down. So, that
takes a lot of communication with clients, but that's – we've doing that now for all of 2022. And if we get into a
rate-down environment, we fully anticipate our relationship managers will begin to pull those deposit prices down
quickly.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Matt, I might add to Harold's comment. There is a lot of energy in the company-owned loan floors. And as you
know, going into this cycle, we had a lot of protection from the loan floors that we were able to successfully
negotiate with our relationships. So, that's also a [indiscernible] (00:59:34).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. Okay. Good points. And I guess shifting over towards the loan growth, the mid-teens guidance. Just trying
to get a better idea of assumptions behind this. I know the bank always does kind of a bottoms-up analysis for
each of its producers.
Any other commentary you can share with us about the process for 2023, especially in light of the slide in the
deck you guys put out there on 2023 where you include that the optimism index of commercial executives is at
very low levels? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. If I understand the question, Matt, you're trying to get at what's our assumption on how we grow in the face
of a declining economy, is that [ph] am I getting (01:00:18)?

Yeah. That's it, Terry. I guess the – I know you did do the bottoms-up analysis with each producer, but I'm trying
to appreciate if there were any more adjustments at the end of that than you typically do each year with your
preliminary guidance.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, I guess, if I get what you're looking for, we went through the same process this year that we always do,
which is both the top-down and a bottoms-up deal. So, again, we – if you would expect, I think we go through
every relationship manager, where they are, what their expected production is. Their targets, as you would guess,
add up to meaningfully more than what our target is at the house here. And so, many of those targets were large
because of the hiring ladder that we have where we've hired so many people over the last three years, so many
people over the last two years, so many people over the last one year, that still owe us the bulk of their book
movement and so forth. So, there is a level of detail that would be down to the relationship manager, and those
expectations would exceed what we believe we'll do or what we're communicating we'll do at the top of the house.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

live.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Just one small question kind of following up on BHG and expenses. So, if I
just think back to the past few years, BHG has been really instrumental in really paying for the build that you've
had in the hiring process and building the core bank. So, at a point in time where we're seeing the BHG
contribution stabilizing, maybe at risk of pulling back a little bit, I guess what does it take for you to feel the need
to adjust the expense outlook a little bit more than this mid-15% range? Is there a level of profitability that you feel
like you shouldn't go below and that might trigger more expense initiatives? Or is it all just about making sure
revenue growth is higher than expense growth and kind of growing EPS that way, but less about maybe what the
ROA is? Any kind of color on that would be super helpful. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. The ROA probably not at the top of our list. We do have ROTCE and all that. But at the end of the day,
Catherine, what we've got are earnings targets, revenue targets per share, and BHG is a component in that. And
so, we're going to try to get to that bottom line number in the most effective way that we can. If that means we cut
costs, we'll cut costs. If that means we need to go try to figure out how to grow revenues in some way that's not in
the plan, we'll do that.

BHG in the past has provided us some tailwind with respect to growth. And so they've typically outgrown our
number year in and year out and that's provided us a little extra resource to go after and support our hiring
platform. This year, it looks like their growth is going to be fairly flat to slightly up. And so that may – you might
imply from that that we may need to back off on hiring in order to kind of meet our EPS targets. So, I don't know if
I'm getting at all your question, Catherine. But we're going to eventually nail down what we think top quartile
growth needs to be for this firm and assemble a plan that is the most likely to achieve it, and that would include
Bankers Healthcare Group in that and we'll use the latest and greatest information we have for them to do it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Hey, Catherine...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
...if I can just maybe make a slightly different point. I don't know if it will be helpful to you or not. It's intended to at
least give you some insights into what our mindset is, what we're trying to do here. I made a comment during the
presentation about how the incentive plans work here. And really just try and clarify for people that I don't think
anybody thought that banks were going to grow earnings in 2022 given the loss of PPP income. But we believe
that we had momentum in the core banking franchise and ability to do that and our incentives were [ph] bet
(01:05:27) on that and we did that. In fact, we outperformed the number, because we got benefit of rate increases
that were beyond expectation, all those kinds of things.
But I guess I just want to be clear. We believe that [ph] the bet (01:05:39) going in that we had more momentum
in the banking franchise, which would carry the day and outrun the loss of PPP income. I think that's different than
what I hear when I talk to most of my peers. That same phenomena exist this year. For me, one of the reasons I
want to go through the momentum, the core momentum, just how you get clients and how much business
momentum exists, it's going to occur regardless of economic conditions and so forth, is to try to help people get
that even in a year, when we're projected BHG to not be a major part of the earnings growth story, that we believe
we have such momentum in the core banking franchise, which just goes back to the story that we've been talking
about for a long time. All the people that we've hired, all the business that their [ph] moving (01:06:25), all the
success they're having penetrating these large banks that are giving up share that we can outrun that.
And so, again, I'm going to guess that's a different story. And so, I know it's frustrating because most people will
easily go to, hey, it looks difficult, why don't we cut expenses. We'll do that if that's what's required, but it's just not
game plan A. We believe we have momentum that's going to produce outsized revenue growth, and that's the
play that we want to make, and as I say, that are not only mine and Harold's, but really the – all the associates of
this firm on that idea.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. That makes sense. So, you're saying in a moment where BHG revenue is less than expected, the core
bank is better. And so that's why you don't have to tap into expenses. But if from here revenue becomes more
challenging or BHG falls more than expected, that's when you can start to flex the expense lever.

EPS growth target.

Catherine Mealor Q

Great. Okay. That's super helpful. And then, this is really a small knit, but just wanted to do it for modeling
purposes. The FTE adjustment typically – and I've looked historically, typically pops up a little bit in the fourth

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2023
Yeah, I think so. Deposit pricing will be key to it. We feel pretty good about where loan pricing is. We feel pretty
good about that. Our fixed rate loan pricing is definitely improving and we've been beating all that drum for several
quarters now. And I think it's finally getting some traction.
So the loan yields, we think, will hang in there. And I think we've got support from [ph] Rob and Rick and Rob
(01:09:23) around the franchise on that. The competition for deposit pricing for us extends beyond what Truist is
paying, what Regents is paying, what some of these other franchises paying around our competitive peers. It
extends into what the money market accounts are doing, what the high yield savings accounts are doing, what the
broker group trying to do with folks, all that as well.
And so that point is that, you know, there is a limit to how much these deposit costs were go. We don't think we
have to go all the way up to – with those levels for sure. But we have told our sales force that we will not lose a
deposit because of price. So, their marching orders are to go out there and make sure that whenever they've got
a chance to defend their deposit portfolio, they do it. And we're not letting those deposits [ph] walk (01:10:24).
Secondly, there was an earlier question about DDAs and where those are headed. There is also a strong
emphasis on that and protecting those deposits as best we can. We did see kind of an initial thrust there in the
quarter that a lot of that DDA movement occurred around November and the November rate increases. We didn't
see nearly that kind of reduction in December, and so we're hopeful that a lot of that – although we anticipate
more to occur, we just – we're hopeful that it won't occur at the same kind of levels that it's occurred here in the
fourth quarter.
So, there's one more thing I'll add as far as margin protection that we're doing tactically, Jennifer, as far as the
loan guidance and all of that, we are actively selling to our sales force the notion of prepayment penalties on all
fixed rate credits, and I think we've been working on that too for the last two or three quarters and we're getting
traction there. So, we're hopeful that if rates do come down for – on us and at least in the near term, we've got
some – or at least in the longer term, we've got some protection there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And the deposit growth that you're projecting for this year would be very strong. Do you think – is this a
permanent shift for Pinnacle in terms of just focus – putting a more intense focus on deposit growth overall?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Jennifer, I think the answer to that question is yes, and all I mean by I think that's yes is, I think we have, since the
founding of the company, had an intense focus on deposit acquisition. As you know, if you have a mature
company, you got a mature retail deposit book and you can sort of milk and ride that. In our case, we got to fund it
as we go. And so, there's a different energy and emphasis around that always and has been there since the
beginning. But clearly, during the pandemic and all the influx of liquidity, we didn't concentrate so much on the
defense of our deposits. We didn't have to do that and those kinds of things. So, it is a different day as the money
supply collapses, deposit book collapses, it does require a different level of energy.
[ph] Happily (01:13:04), during that pandemic period, we've built three or four specialty deposit businesses that all
have some level of traction in them. I'm going to guess, Jennifer, that in 2022, those four specialties probably
produced – I don't know – $800 million to $900 million in deposits for us. We expect that growth to be still bigger
as we go forward. We're in the early stages with still positive momentum in all four of those specialties.

And so, that's the reason I say, okay, yeah, I think there is a structural difference in our ability to do this, which in
addition to all the energy and emphasis of the relationship managers, we do have some product specialties that
are pretty meaningful in terms of how they are bolstering our deposit growth.

line is live.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey, guys. Good morning. I'll be brief. Just, Harold, Terry, just the hiring outlook for this year. I mean, I think you
talked last quarter about where you thought it might be. But given fourth quarter is wrapped up and some of the
commentary earlier, how are you thinking about hiring in 2023 relative to 2022?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think one of the things that's important, Brian, when we talk about hiring, most of the time when we're
talking with investors, we really talk primarily about hiring revenue producers because that's really the thrust of our
company, has been all along. What we're trying to do is grow our revenues, grow our topline in order to grow our
bottom line, all that sort of stuff. But again, just to sort of maybe make a point that it's obvious but sometimes
forgotten, those revenue producers are generally going to be supportive two-to-one by non-revenue producers.
And so, the total number of people that have to be hired in a year, I think that increases we're in the 400 person
range. Don't know what the exact number is, it'd be in that range for a total associates hired, whereas the revenue
producers were down closer to 125, I think, for the year.
So, the point I'm really trying to get to with you is I think we will expect a similar year on revenue producers. We'll
expect a less – we expect to hire less is support personnel in 2023 than in 2022, primarily because a lot of that
support personnel have been in control infrastructure and so forth, which generally in my view is a stair-step kind
of expense. You got to build the capacity for [indiscernible] (01:15:48) compliance monitoring, BSA risk, loan
review, all of those kind of things. You invest in people in stair step mode. I think we've make significant
investments in the control infrastructure.
So, it's a long-winded way to say, look, I think revenue hires might be a little less in 2023 than 2022, but it will be
comparable. Total number of hires ought to be less in 2023 than 2022 because of the stair-step nature of some of
those control expenditure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. No, that's helpful. And maybe one or two for Harold. Just on the reserve level, Harold, just can you talk
about maybe being a little bit more pessimistic on – or Terry did on kind of the outlook? Just how should we think
about the reserve level as you kind of go through the next several quarters given your outlook?

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2023
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I'm meeting with the credit officers quite a bit. Right now, they are still having the same posture that our
credit book is strong. We're not seeing any kind of systemic kind of weakness in it. And so, our planning
assumption today is that our reserves probably will be fairly flat here on out. We'll obviously monitor that. So, if we
start seeing some weakness and adjust accordingly. But right now, we think credit is in check as best we know
today.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. And then, just going back to your comment, Harold, about the fee income. I guess the – you
highlighted the wealth. I mean, when you think about the mortgage and the SBA piece in there, are those
expected I guess kind of in your big picture planning to rebound a fair amount? I guess just kind of getting to this
number you talk about on the fee income side, the high single digit or low double digit growth in fee income ex
those kind of, more volatile numbers. It just seems like there's more to it, I guess, on some those other items that
you're not calling out. So like the – for instance, the mortgage and SBA, do you expect – I know SBA was down
this quarter, same thing with mortgage, a pretty meaningful rebound in those coming in the next couple of
quarters?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. For sure in mortgage. I don't know about SBA. SBA has got some other headwinds. But no, mortgage
should have a better year this year than last year. And this whole wealth management investment that we've
made should produce tangible results. We've also hired some very capable individuals in our capital markets area
that [ph] all (01:18:30) help us. They have a long resumé of success, so we're planning on that being influential as
well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. And last one, Harold, and I'll let you go, is the margin outlook you talked about that kind of
assumes your two rate hikes. If you see a – the Fed lower rates at all, does that – how does that change the
margin outlook, I guess, particularly as you get later in the year into next year? I guess does that – if it's not
material declines, is it not much change from what your forecast is today or kind of your outlook?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. We actually have some rate [ph] increases (01:19:07) in November and December in our forecast right
now. But they are pretty much inconsequential.
