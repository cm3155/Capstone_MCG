Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial's Second Quarter Earnings Call. On the call with
me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer. Following their
remarks, we'd be happy to take your questions.
Turning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website, on slide 2, you'll see a
discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically, during the call, you will hear references to various non-
GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company's operations. Reconciliation of non-
GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials and on our website.
Some statements that we make on this call may be forward looking, reflecting management's expectations about
future events and overall operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of

today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause
actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our second quarter 2022
earnings release, our 2021 annual report to shareholders, and our 2021 10-K report. We make no obligation to
publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.
On slide 3, you see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the second quarter. Below that, you'll see
our adjusted operating results, which management believes enhances the understanding of our business by
reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis.
Many of the comments that management makes on the call today will focus on adjusted operating results.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.

James Michael Cracchiolo
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Ameriprise performed well in a significantly
more challenging environment and delivered a solid quarter. Clearly, high inflation in the U.S. and globally, as well
as geopolitical uncertainty continued to cause greater volatility and pressured markets. With the Fed raising rates
and concern about a potential recession, markets are experiencing headwinds and that's weighing on investor
sentiment.
While the environment impacted our results, particularly in Asset Management, we delivered strong profitability,
good client flows in Wealth Management and strong results at the bank. We're continuing to serve clients well,
managing our expenses prudently, and investing in the business to drive near and longer-term growth.
Let's move to second-quarter results. Compared to a year ago, total assets under management and
administration declined 3% to $1.2 trillion. We benefited from the BMO EMEA acquisition and the cumulative
impact of Ameriprise client net inflows, but assets were affected by a negative foreign exchange and the steep
decline in both equity and fixed income markets. In terms of adjusted operating financials, revenues grew 3% to
$3.5 billion, as good business performance offset market impacts. With that, earnings were up 4% with EPS up
10% to $5.81. And ROE was very strong at 48.8% compared to 37.5% a year ago.
I'll turn to Advice & Wealth Management where we delivered another strong quarter. We had good activity in a
tough market environment. We're serving clients well with our goal-based advice, driving strong engagement and
earning strong satisfaction. Total client net inflows were $8.6 billion, down 10%, but quite good in this
environment. Our wrap net inflows also declined to $6.2 billion. Cash balances were up sharply to more than $47
billion compared to more than $39 billion a year ago.
Even in a more challenging operating environment, our advisor productivity was strong, up 11% to $814,000 per
advisor. We recently hosted our national conference for our top advisors and the level of engagement was terrific.
They're excited about growing their practices at Ameriprise and appreciate the investments we've made and the
support we provide.
We're also seeing nice engagement with advisor recruits. We had another good quarter in terms of recruiting,
adding 99 highly productive advisors. Our value proposition stands even taller in choppier markets. When
experienced advisors join us, they routinely say our culture, technology, financial planning capabilities, and ability
to grow are key reasons they make the move. We're driving meaningful momentum and I feel good about our
pipeline.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2022
Now I'll give you some perspective on our growing cash business, which represents a significant future revenue
and earnings opportunity for us. First, we're beginning to generate more revenue from our off-balance sheet cash
as the Fed increases short rates. Second, we continue to move more assets to Ameriprise bank, garnering
additional spread, including moving $2.3 billion to the bank late in the second quarter. For perspective, total bank
assets are now at $17.1 billion. Assets have more than doubled since the beginning of 2021 and we're positioned
to take this further. An important takeaway for you is that as we move through the second half of 2022 and into
2023, the growth of our cash business and rising interest rates will provide an offset to equity market weakness.
That leads me to AWM's financials. We continue to generate strong pre-tax income, up 16%, to nearly $500
million, and our margin continues to accrete, up 250 basis points nearly 24%, even after the impact of substantial
market declines.
Moving to Retirement & Protection Solutions, the business is performing well in this environment and reflects our
strategy to focus on our core products. I'll start with variable annuities. Overall, sales were down 29% given our
move away from living benefit guarantees. We continue to prioritize annuities without living benefits in our
structured products. In Protection, life sales declined 23% given the climate and our move away from fixed
insurance. We remain focused on our VUL and DI products which have good profitability and are appropriate for
our clients. In terms of earnings, they were in line with our expectations and our financial results and free cash
flow were good. And our risk profile remains well managed.
Now, let's turn to Asset Management. We've already referenced the challenging operating environment that has
resulted in asset declines and tough retail flows for the industry. We're experiencing that pressure, too. However,
we feel like the business is performing well and we're making appropriate adjustments as we move forward.
Assets under management was up a bit year-over-year as a result of the BMO acquisition and the cumulative
impact of net inflows, offset by market declines and a significant foreign exchange impact in the quarter. Revenue
was essentially flat overall.
Let's start with investment performance. Our long-term numbers continue to show good consistency for our 3, 5
and 10-year time periods, with over 75% of our funds above median on an asset-weighted basis. Regarding one-
year performance, it's been a tough period in both equities and fixed income. Domestic equity results were good,
driven by our largest funds moving back above the median. In international equities, our quality position has been
more of a challenge in these markets. In fixed income, results have been solid in Europe but in the U.S., we're
impacted by our longer duration positioning and quality focus in credit. We do feel with market conditions
beginning to stabilize, we should see some improvement.
Let's turn to flows, where we had outflows of $3.1 billion in the quarter that included $1.2 billion of legacy
insurance partner outflows. This reflects the pressure you've seen in retail, but was partially offset by positive
institutional results. In retail overall, we had lower gross sales and higher redemptions resulting in $5.8 billion of
net outflows. This was driven largely by weak conditions in the United States and to a lesser extent, in EMEA.
In U.S. retail, equity outflows were generally in line with the industry, and in fixed income, results were behind
given our product mix. Compared to the industry, we did not participate nearly as much in short duration. As
interest rates stabilize and investors see opportunities, we believe our product positioning should garner improved
flows. In EMEA, retail flows also remained under pressure. However, we did see some improvement in
Continental Europe.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2022
Turning to global institutional, excluding legacy insurance partners, net inflows were $3.9 billion. We had some
good inflows in fixed income and other strategies. In addition to our broad lineup of traditional institutional
strategies, we're bringing more focus to multi-asset and solutions as well as alternatives.
I was with the team in London in June and they're feeling good about the core business, the integration, and the
extensive capabilities we offer clients. In fact, just a few weeks ago, we announced a rebranding of BMO
Strategies to Columbia Threadneedle which was an important step as we move forward.
I'll close Asset Management with the financials. Our margin was 38.5%, and that incorporated the BMO business,
which has lower margins based on their mix. Given market decline and impact on revenue, we're taking steps to
continue to control discretionary expenses thoughtfully. We'll be paying close attention to market environment as
we move forward.
So overall, Ameriprise remains in a strong position. We have a proven track record of navigating tougher times
and we'll continue to do so. We're highly engaged with our clients in helping them stay on track. And from a
financial perspective, rising interest rates will act as an offset to compressed markets as we move through the
balance of the year. We will be focused on managing our discretionary expenses even more tightly as we move
forward.
Importantly, our balance sheet fundamentals remain very good. We continue to generate strong returns of
substantial free cash flow, which provide flexibility. In the quarter, we returned $600 million to shareholders and
are on track to return 90% of operating earnings to shareholders in 2022.
With that, I'll turn it over to Walt, who will provide his perspective and more detail on the quarter, and then we'll
take your questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Thank you. As Jim said, results in the quarter were strong, with earnings up 4% to $665 million and EPS up 10%
to $5.81, in face of substantial market declines.
This demonstrates the underlying strength of our business model and highlights the diversification benefit each
segment provides across market cycles, as well as initial interest rate benefits and overall expense discipline
throughout the firm. As we move into the second half of the year, benefits from rising rates and higher cash
balances are expected to offset the realized pressures from the market volatility. Our high-quality, diversified
investment portfolio and hedge program continue to support strong balance sheet fundamentals and our business
is generating good free cash flow.
Despite the elevated level of market volatility in the quarter, Ameriprise returned $600 million of capital to
shareholders and maintain significant excess capital, $1.6 billion. We are on track to return approximately 90% of
adjusted operating earnings to shareholders this year.
Let's turn to slide 6. We ended the quarter with assets under management and administration to $1.2 trillion, down
3%, reflecting equity and bond market depreciation as well as foreign exchange. We are executing our growth
strategies including the integration of the BMO business.
The BMO business contributed to our geographic diversification, with international assets now representing 36%
of asset management, AUM, up from 27% prior to the BMO acquisition. And we continued to benefit from strong

underlying organic growth momentum, with $69 billion of wealth in Asset Management flows over the last 12
months. Total flows in the quarter were $6 billion, with $9 billion of inflows in Wealth Management offset by $3
billion of outflows in Asset Management.
Let's turn to individual segment performance beginning with Wealth Management on slide 7. Wealth Management
client assets declined 9% to $735 billion. Despite the exceptional market depreciation in the quarter with equities
down 15% and bonds down 10%, we generated strong client flows from new client acquisition, excellent
experienced advisor recruiting, and deeper client relationships. Our advisors had strong productivity growth with
revenue per advisor reaching $814,000 in the quarter, up 11% from the prior year.
On slide 8, you can see Wealth Management profitability benefited from organic growth and the initial rise in
interest rates. Adjusted net operating revenues increased 4%, or $76 million, to $2.1 billion as market
depreciation and lower transactional activity during the quarter was more than offset by rising interest rates and
client flows. Cash balances increased to $47 billion, up 21% from last year. At the same time, the gross fee yield
doubled versus last year, driving higher interest earnings in the quarter. Expenses remain well managed. G&A
expenses increased $15 million, or 4%, primarily from higher volume-based expenses over the past year.
Overall, Wealth Management profitability remained strong with pre-tax adjusted operating earnings of $492
million, up 16% from last year. And our pre-tax operating margin reached 23.9%, up 250 basis points.
As you can see on slide 9, we are well positioned to realize significant incremental benefits from rising rates on
our cash products this year and going forward. In the quarter, we transferred $2.3 billion of broker-dealer sweep
balances onto the bank's balance sheet in two and three-year duration strategies with yields above 4% on
average. In July, yields on new money purchases at the bank increased further and are in the 4.5% range.
We continue to feel good about the credit quality of the portfolio, with most of the portfolio in the AAA-rated
structured assets. We plan to bring an additional $3 billion of assets onto the balance sheet during the third
quarter, bringing the full year increase to $7 billion.
Our model leverages both broker-dealer sweep program and the bank to optimize earnings from cash products.
Currently, we have about one-third of the client cash balances at the bank, and we expect it to be nearly 40% by
the end of the year. In addition, our certificate business is another area that benefits from rising interest rates.
In total, we expect to generate substantially more interest-related revenue in 2022 relative to 2021, which would
offset current market-related impacts. Based upon our current assumptions, the interest rate benefit will increase
further in 2023.
Let's turn to Asset Management on slide 10, where performance was in line with the macro environment. Total
assets under management increased 1% to $598 billion, as the acquisition of BMO business was largely offset by
market depreciation and foreign exchange translation. Asset Management flows were negative in the quarter with
continued strength in our global institutional business offsetting a meaningful portion of retail outflows. Like the
industry, we continue to experience pressures from global market volatility, a risk-off investor sentiment, and
geopolitical strain in EMEA.
Margin in the quarter declined to 38.5%. It should be noted that BMO reduces our margins by approximately 400
basis points. Going forward, our new margin target will be in the 31% to 35% range, reflecting the addition of
BMO, which is primarily an institutional business.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2022
On slide 11, you can see Asset Management financial results were a reflection of the challenging market
backdrop. Adjusted operating revenues were essentially flat at $881 million, as the addition of BMO offset the
impact of double-digit market depreciation, foreign exchange rates and outflows. Likewise, earnings in the quarter
declined $31 million. Importantly, we are managing the areas we can control. The underlying fee rate remained
stable in the quarter at 48 basis points. Expenses remain well managed with G&A expenses down 6%, excluding
BMO.
We are currently in the process of evaluating all discretionary spend and hiring. We remain committed to
managing expenses very tightly in the current revenue environment.
Let's turn to slide 12. Retirement & Protection Solutions continued to deliver stable earnings and free cash flow
generation as a result of its differentiated risk profile. Pre-tax adjusted operating earnings were $179 million.
Sales in the quarter declined as a result of market dislocation and management actions to reduce the risk profile
of the business. Most notably, variable annuity sales declined 29%, reflecting the uncertain market environment,
as well as our decision to exit manufacturing products with living benefit riders, which was completed in June.
Account value with living benefit riders represent less than 60% of the overall book, down nearly 3 percentage
points from last year.
Our risk profile remained strong, with 94% VA hedge effectiveness in the quarter, and an estimated RBC ratio of
530%.
Now, let's move to the balance sheet on slide 13. Our balance sheet fundamentals remain strong and our
diversified, high-quality AA-rated investment portfolio remains well positioned. These strong fundamentals allow
us to deliver a consistent and differentiated level of capital return to shareholders, even during periods of market
volatility that we experienced this quarter.
During the quarter, we returned $600 million to shareholders and excess capital is at $1.6 billion. We remain on
track to return approximately 90% of the adjusted operated earnings to shareholders in 2022.
With that, we'll take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We have our
first question from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Love to start with the bank and the yield. Provided some great
color on plans to continue to shift balances. Saw really attractive balances but I believe, Walter, that you indicated
that assets moved to the bank in the second quarter, late in the quarter. So, considering that and considering
where reinvestments are, how should we be calibrating for the potential yield upside, not only from averaging in
the late shift in the quarter, but then further deployments of the $3 billion that you're considering in the third
quarter? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Okay. So if I understand your question, we [ph] weren't really (22:26) shifting in the $3 billion. We believe it will be
in the early part of the quarter that we will do that. Obviously, we'll continue to invest in our structured AAA
investments, in which currently are yielding in the 4.5% range. And so that will make a total of about $7 billion of
new funds into the bank and deployed. And like I said, in the second quarter is 4.2% and now at current rates is
4.5%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay, great. Thank you. And then when we're thinking about NII continuing to grow, saw really strong margin
trends here this quarter – pre-tax margin trends in AWM despite the challenging environment – so NII clearly
helpful there. As that continues to grow, you continue to deploy more cash. Should we be continuing to pace
margin expansion at a similar level that we saw here in the second quarter, even if markets remain challenging?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Again, a lot of assumptions in there, but from the standpoint of looking at the opportunity we have on the cash
side and certainly the strong flows that we are garnering in this environment, you should be able to see margin
maintain and expand.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for the color.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2022
Hey, good morning. Recruiting was very solid. I think you've got now 10,200 plus advisors. It was up about a
percent sequentially. How's the pipeline there? Is this a business that you think is going to continue to grow
throughout the year despite this market turmoil?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Andrew, yes. Thank you for the question. We continue to see good recruits. I mean, actually, second quarter was
actually stronger than the first. And the pipeline continues to look good. We are speaking to more people. I think
people are recognizing what we bring to the plate in combination of the support we give, the technology, and how
we help them really grow their practices. We're getting really strong reviews from people who have joined us. And
so, we feel that this is a continued good opportunity for us. And even as you go through these volatile markets,
based on the type of support we give and helping advisors to actually achieve more in regard to their productivity
and how they manage their businesses, we feel it's a good opportunity for us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Kligerman Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
That's great. And then just on the wrap flows, if you'd asked me three years ago when you were doing $4 billion to
$5 billion in net flows and you said you did 6.2 billion like this quarter, I would have thought that was an
outstanding result. And probably it still is. But recently you had peak numbers around $10 billion. And my question
is, is this $6.2 billion a good base now? Or do you think that could continue to be pressured even lower, just given
the market volatility?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Well, I think what you're asking – it's also an excellent question. And so, yes, our total client activity has increased
over the years as you've seen. And even in this last quarter, we brought in almost $9 billion of new client inflows.
Now, with this market, as you would imagine, the deployment of whether it's new money or even current money is
a little more – people are a little more putting on the sidelines and waiting until things are stable. So, money's still
being deployed but not to the extent where you have rising markets or the stability in the markets.
So with the pullback we experienced, I mean, first part of the year, you're down 20%. Bond markets were also
down. So, I think the $6 billion is quite strong in this type of market environment. My feeling is money will continue
to go back into the market as things stabilize particularly even in the fixed side of the business. So, I don't see
anything changing. Now, whether you got some material market dislocation occurring in third and fourth quarter, I
can't tell you. But I think if markets aren't materially different, we should still continue to see good flows.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Kligerman Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
That's great. Thanks a lot.

Alexander Blostein Q

Hey, good morning, everybody. Thank you for the question. So maybe just to start with some of the cash
balances dynamic within Advice & Wealth. Walt, I was wondering if you can give us an update how the cash

balance is holding up so far in the third quarter, given obviously pretty strong trends in Q2 with cash balances
being up? And as we think about the deposit betas, it looks like you guys passed through almost nothing to the
customer in the second quarter. So, any updated thoughts around sustainability of sort of such low deposit betas
as you progress through the rest of the year would be helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Sure, Alex. They are holding up from that standpoint, so the trend you've seen, it is holding. As it relates to the
crediting rate for clients, we go through an extensive competitive review. And on that basis, we did increase some
of the rates as it relates to – based on that review and we will certainly consider continuing to evaluate that, which
we do weekly. Also, we see that obviously, we will start crediting if the Fed basically increases on the 75 basis
points that we anticipate at the end of the month. And so right now, we feel there is certainly opportunity as rates
increase and to certainly credit and those are in our assumption base.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. I guess as you think about just the trade-off of growing the bank beyond 2022, you gave obviously very
clear guidance of how large you expect the bank to get by the end of 2022. But seeing how the yield on broker
sweep balances will be fairly attractive given again it's all floating, how are you kind of thinking about balancing
growth of the bank versus just leaving it in third-party bank sweep given that spread probably narrows a bit here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Listen, it's a good question but if you go back to the first quarter of 2020, certainly we were earning
certainly a good short-term return, and then disappeared. So, the bank gives us the ability to really have a steady
earnings strength with high-quality investments. So we are balancing that, and the spread we're getting right now
we feel is very good with the risk profile. So, we will continue to do that. From that standpoint, we feel it's a critical
part of our overall cash strategy. So, we're very fortunate to have the bank, not only to offer to our clients new
products and capability, but also given the ability to have the stabilization of having the spread income come
through.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Just a quick one for me at the end here. As we think about G&A, that's held up really nicely in the quarter.
Particularly, we've seen you guys bring down expenses in G&A in the Asset Management business. But when you
think about the firm-wide G&A run rate for the back half of the year, given obviously fee challenges on the back of
lower markets, how are you thinking about the G&A run rate for the back half? I heard your comments
qualitatively about pausing maybe some of the initiatives and looking for ways to save. But I guess relative to like
the $880-ish million G&A run rate we saw in the second quarter, what does the back half look like?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Number one, from a company standpoint, certainly we look at – we are going to be very well managed on our
G&A overall as you indicated. Certainly, Asset Management, Jim indicated certainly they're looking at
discretionary spend. So overall from a company standpoint, we are going to be in the range that we talk about
and we're performing well. As it relates to AWM, with the good revenue growth we see and everything, it's going
to be managed, but we are certainly trying to garner and increase basically and take advantage of this situation to

which we think is going to be good.

Good morning. Walter, just wanted to come back to what – if you can] give some indication of broadly what you're

you give a little more color on why you feel confident in the quality on the asset side?

Okay. It is structured. It's in CMBS. It is basically in retail MBS and the CLOs are the highest structure within the
structure. And they all are triple rated from that standpoint. 88% of what we invest is in AAA-structured securities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay. That's helpful. Question on your capital. I think excess capital went down by $300 million this quarter. Can
you talk a bit about what drove it? I assume it was variable annuity related in your life insurance business. Maybe
a little bit below the surface sort of what happened there with hedging. Was it higher required capital and what
kind of drove that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Well, it's – you saw it dropped $300 million, again within our [indiscernible] (32:47) expectations. There was that
tolerance reporting; it was within total tolerances. It hit reserves and basically capital on the VA side, as it relates
to the 15% drop in the quarter. And so from that standpoint, the hedging was effective, is at 94%, so we feel very
comfortable with it. But it was a substantial drop and certainly within our expectations from our modeling. So, it
was both – on both reserves and on capital.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then final question, just can you give an update on how the whole process for potential risk
transfer is going? Whether, I think when you started this whole process late in 2021, you had commented that you
felt like the quality of your insurance business would be validated as you went through that process. Would you
say you still feel that way? That if you do do something, it's going be reflected in an attractive price? Or what have
you learned so far through that process maybe?

So, as again, we're continuing to evaluate. We certainly have interest in that and we're evaluating that. And yes,
to be direct about it, I think that it is clear to us that the value and the quality which we have is being recognized
from that standpoint. But as you know, these are long tail valuations and they're continuing.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Suneet Kamath.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Suneet Kamath Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple for me. Walter, I think last quarter you talked about a $200 million benefit
from the bank. And I know we talked about a bunch of moving pieces so far on this call. But can you give us a
sense, at least based on where we sit today, kind of how you're feeling about that $200 million number? Did it
contemplate future rate hikes and that sort of thing? Just some color there would be helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Sure. So in there, we're anticipating based on latest estimates from the Fed, there'll be an additional 175 basis
point increase and we'll see where that goes. Certainly, we also, the crediting rates, we are assuming that we
would start distributing at a higher level within that. So right now, the number versus for the whole year, is the
change versus last year would be in the $400 million range plus. So that $200 million that we talked about is in
the $400 million range plus for the total year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Suneet Kamath Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
And that's for 2022? So, as we think about 2023...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Higher than 2021, yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Suneet Kamath Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. Okay. All right. That's good. And then I guess, sort of a specific one. But I noticed that your long-term care
reserves came down, I think, about 11%, 10%, 11% from last year. Is that just the benefit of higher rates? Can
you talk about that a little bit?
And then, to follow up on Tom's risk transfer question, any more activity in terms of long-term care that you're
hearing in the market?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Okay. On the reserves, I believe it is but we'll get back and confirm that. As it relates to – we're evaluating. Let me
just say, we continue to evaluate across the spectrum. All right?

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2022
Suneet Kamath Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And then just last one is just on the Asset Management margin. The new target of 31% to 35%, is that
entirely BMO-driven or is there also a piece related to the pretty significant market decline that we've seen here in
the second quarter? And then at some point, do you start to push back towards your prior range or is it just kind of
the new level for that business? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
The 400 basis points is strictly BMO. That's a normalization on the BMO. So the 35% to 39% is, like I said, going
down the 400 basis points strictly because in BMO it does not – and then obviously, were coming down because
of the market standpoint. But of course, we were in the 40%'s and now it's dropping because of the deleveraging
that's taking place because of the equity markets and the fixed income.
And we'll continue – that's it – hopefully I answered it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Suneet Kamath Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah, I got it. Sounds like that's the new level with the business. Okay, thanks.

Operator: Our next question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi, good morning. So, just one follow-up for me relating to that prior question on the Asset Management margin
outlook. I just wanted to make sure, Walter. It does sound like that is the new run rate, but does that 31% to 35%
contemplate some of the actions you alluded to around discretionary spend? And also wanted to see whether that
also incorporated some of the BMO expense synergies that are not yet reflected in the run rate?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So from that standpoint, it is now normalized, okay, because we always said it would be 35% to 39%, and it is our
target range. So as we look at the markets and we evaluate the implications, we are going to be looking at the
expenses. And it does have some of the synergies that we anticipated with BMO, which was going to be more
back loaded to 2023.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Understood. And maybe just one quick follow up. Can you just speak to how the flow trends are tracking in July,
just so we can think about some of the cadence of flows versus 2Q, recognizing the industry is still facing some
headwinds just from a flow perspective?

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2022
Yes. So, this is Jim. What I would expect is a more of a continuation at this point. I think from a retail perspective,
I think things are still on the Asset Management side, soft. I think you'll see that across the industry. If you look at
the new SIMS data coming out or will come out, I think on institutional, it's just longer for mandates, et cetera. But
so, I don't see a dramatic change at this point. Now, we'll see what the Fed does, and we'll see what the outlook is
for various things as we go forward, but that's what I would probably say.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q

Operator: And thank you. Our next question is from John Barnidge with Piper Sandler.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Barnidge Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thank you very much. With that new guidance around margins in the Asset Management segment, can you
maybe talk about the level of composition of variable expenses, maybe across the franchise in your businesses?
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Again, looking at our expense base, there's a reasonable portion that's variable, but again, the exact proportions,
it gives us the ability to certainly adjust. The exact percentages, candidly I would have to get back on that
because there's investment spending that we do, and certainly we have evaluation of hiring and other things on
open positions. So, there's a reasonable amount of variable in there, but I don't have the exact percentages in
front of me right now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Barnidge Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
And then maybe my follow-up question, is there a way to size the liability-driven investing opportunity? That
seems like that's been a strong area for institutional.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, with the BMO acquisition, et cetera, they have very good capabilities, and now we are looking at those
opportunities across the franchise with our expanded level of institutional business. And so, we feel it will be a
good channel as well as a relationship building channel for us.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2022
Hi, thank you. Can you talk about the level of foreign exchange sensitivity in the Asset Management business
post the BMO acquisition? And there's clearly impact on revenues and AUM, but how much of an offset is there in
expenses? And how should we think about the kind of net earnings impact?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah, so with BMO, obviously we shifted from 27% to 36%, and that is sensitive, too. So approximately in the PTI
elements of it, it was around a $15 million impact to us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erik Bass Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
$15 million in the quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. That's a net. Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erik Bass Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Got it. Thank you. And then you highlighted the $1.6 billion of excess capital that you have. And in past periods of
market weakness, you've sometimes increased the level of capital return above the 90% target of earnings and
leaned into buybacks a bit more. Is that something that you would consider given the pullback in your stock year
to date?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Well, if I understand your question, certainly with the $1.6 billion we feel comfortable continuing as we indicated,
hitting our trend line for the 90% for the year. And obviously as you look at the back half of the year, we'll be able
to certainly with that 90% hitting buyback a lot more shares where the share price was last year versus it is right
now. Hopefully, we'll get back to where it is. But where it is right now gives us the ability at that level to buy back
more shares.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erik Bass Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Got it. But you're not thinking of changing the percentage?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
At this stage, we evaluate each quarter, but the answer is – and we'll be optimistic as we assess it – but we're still
targeting 90%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
And remember, I think it's actually pretty good. A lot of companies are pulling back on their buybacks if they were
doing them. And we're doing them at a still very strong rate.

Operator: We have our next question from Kenneth Lee.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth Lee Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just one on the Asset Management side again. Curious as to
what you're seeing in terms of net flows within the fixed income category, just given the industry trends we're
seeing. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yes, so what we saw in our business is our net flows were a little – on a percentage basis – a little worse than
where we saw on our equity side, and that's mainly because of the mix of business that we have. So some other
players that might have had larger areas of short duration, et cetera, we have a short duration business, but it's
not necessarily one that we're across all our channels in. And so, people who had that business saw a little more
of the inflow in there than we did because we really were in mortgages and total bond and things such as that, a
little longer duration products.
And then the other area that I think probably had some greater flows was more on the leveraged loan area, which
is only a small business for us. So, I think it had to do more with mix than anything else. But because of being in
the type that we were in, with the dislocation in the fixed income market, as you would imagine, redemptions
would be up a little more and flows were down.
Municipals was another area that we had a bit of that weakness and based on the market situation. But we
believe that the areas that we do have now based on the credit quality, et cetera, will come back, we think, as
interest rates stabilize a little more or as you see on the long end, it's starting to soften up a little bit.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth Lee Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. Very helpful there. And just one related question as my follow-up. More broadly speaking within the Asset
Management side, how do you think about the overall product offerings mix, the strategies out there? Any
particular gap that you would like to fill at this point? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah, so what we have now, we have a good mix with the BMO acquisition. So, we're putting more energy and
time on the ESG of the RI part, responsible investing. We're doing more on things like LDI [ph] and (54:02)
solutions. We're doing more on alternatives. We're trying to build out a little more on our retail real estate and
property businesses, institutional as well. And so, there are certain things like that that we're focused on for what

we have in place. So, we feel good about the mix that we have. Again, we're in a little bit of this – I think you'll look
across the Asset Management industry – I'm not sure you'll see a lot of favorability at this point across. But I think
we're in good shape. We have good businesses. We can manage our expenses. We're still investing
appropriately to get some greater scale efficiencies in the integration with BMO.
So again, we're in a little bit of a dislocation market. But I think – and that's really one of the benefits of the firm
like Ameriprise. We're very balanced. Even where I know on one end someone says risk transfer, but we
generate some really good solid earnings and cash flow from our I&A business activities. Our AWM now, with the
growth of the bank and complement, it gives us a good now offset. So, I think over time again you'll see the
strength of how the company really plays out and how we can use this opportunity to really leverage against the –
whether it's having to do with shareholder return or even flexibility.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan Krueger Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just a follow- up on the $400 million of upside from interest rates in full year 2022.
Just given that probably a fair amount of that is coming in the back half of the year, are you able to comment on
how we should – how that might look in 2023 as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Should look pretty good.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter Stanley Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah, obviously – it's Walter – you're going to get normalization if the Fed increases come in, which is 175
coming in in the back end, and getting the normalization on calendarization that's going to take place there. It is
dependent, of course, again, what happens to the cash balances and the crediting rate. So, there's a lot of
variables. But as Jim said, you're going to get an increase. And certainly, we anticipate there will be an increase
based on our modeling. Again, from our standpoint, it is going to be substantial.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan Krueger Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. And then just on the Asset Management margin target, you were still a fair amount above that new target in
the second quarter. Is this – should we just think about this as a longer-term target? Or in the current
environment, would you anticipate being down to within that new target in the near term?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Michael Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
I think what you have to sort of factor in, and again, it depends on what happens with markets, right. You had a bit
more of a dislocation of the markets in the second quarter. And so, as you look at that, probably compared to

Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

where the averages are between the first and the second quarter going into the third, you will continue to have a
little bit more of that margin compression, as there's depreciation on the asset base if you roll it over.
But having said that, I would say that we still feel good about being within those margins after you take that into
account. So remember, markets depreciated, and it's not just equity markets. The fixed income market, which is
not normal in a sense where you get both of them depreciating at the same time.
