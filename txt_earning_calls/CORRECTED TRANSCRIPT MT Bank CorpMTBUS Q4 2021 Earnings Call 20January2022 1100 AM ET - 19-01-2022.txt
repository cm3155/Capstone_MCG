Before we get into the details of the recent quarter's results, I'd like to pause and reflect on a few highlights of the
past year. While the impact of the pandemic is still being felt by M&T and the rest of the banking industry, the
turnaround in 2021 has been remarkable. We've seen a transition from economic contraction and a zero-bound
interest rate environment to this prospect of persistent inflation and higher interest rates in 2022.
Against that backdrop, GAAP based diluted earnings per common share were $13.80 compared with $9.94 in
2020, up 39%. Net income was $1.86 billion, compared with $1.35 billion in the prior year, improved by 37%.
Those results produced returns on average assets and average common equity of 1.22% and 11.54%,
respectively. Net operating income, which excludes the after tax impact from the amortization of intangible assets,
as well as merger related expenses, was $1.9 billion, up 39% compared with $1.36 billion in the prior year.
Net operating income per diluted common share was $14.11 compared with $10.02 in 2020, up 41%. Net
operating income for 2021 expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible
common shareholders' equity was 1.28% and 16.8%, respectively. We increased the common stock dividend for
the fifth consecutive year to an annual rate of $4.80 per share per year.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
Tangible book value per share grew to $89.80 at the end of 2021, up 11.5% from the end of 2020. And as we
build capital, in anticipation of the merger with People's United Financial, our CET1 ratio increased to an
estimated 11.4% at the end of 2021 from 10% at the end of 2020. While the season – pardon me, the year had its
ups and downs, it sure felt like another division championship.
Now, let's turn to the results for the quarter. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $3.37 for the fourth
quarter of 2021, compared with $3.69 in the third quarter of 2021 and $3.52 in the fourth quarter of 2020. Net
income for the quarter was $458 million, compared with $495 million in the linked quarter and $471 million in the
year ago quarter. On a GAAP basis, M&T's fourth quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on
average assets of 1.15% and an annualized return on average common equity of 10.91%. This compares with
rates of 1.28% and 12.16%, respectively, in the previous quarter.
Included in GAAP results in the recent quarter were after-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets
amounting to $1 million, or $0.01 per common share, little changed from the prior quarter. Also included in the
quarter's results were merger-related expenses of $21 million, related to M&T's proposed acquisition of People's
United Financial. This amounted to $16 million after-tax or $0.12 per common share. Results for 2021's third
quarter included $9 million of such charges, amounting to $7 million after-tax or $0.05 per common share.
Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or
tangible basis from which we've only ever excluded the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well
as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions when they occur.
M&T's net operating income for the fourth quarter, which excludes intangible amortization and merger-related
expenses, was $475 million. That compares with $504 million in the linked quarter and $473 million in last year's
fourth quarter.
Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $3.50 for the recent quarter, compared with $3.76 in
2021's third quarter and $3.54 in the fourth quarter of 2020. Net operating income yielded annualized rates of
return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders' equity of 1.23% and 15.98% for
the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.34% and 17.54% in the third quarter of 2021.
In accordance with the SEC's guideline, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP
and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity. Included in the recent quarter's GAAP and net
operating results was a $30 million distribution from Bayview Lending Group. This amounted to $22 million after-
tax effect and $0.17 per common share. We received the [ph] late (00:08:11) distribution in the fourth quarter of
2020. Prior to 2020, we had generally received such distributions in the first quarter of each year.
Turning to the balance sheet and the income statement. Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $937 million
in the fourth quarter of 2021, marking a decrease of $34 million, or 3% from the linked quarter. The primary driver
of that decrease was a $30 million decline in interest income and fees from PPP loans, as that portfolio continues
to decline following forgiveness of those loans by the Small Business Administration.
The net interest margin decreased by 16 basis points to 2.58%. That compares with 2.74% in the linked quarter.
We estimate that the higher balance of low yielding cash on deposit at the Federal Reserve diluted the margin by
about 9 basis points in the quarter.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
The lower income from PPP loans, including declines in the scheduled amortization and accelerated recognition
of fees from forgiven loans contributed about 5 basis points of the margin pressure. All other factors, including
lower benefit from hedges, accounted for an estimated 2 basis points of the decline.
Average earning assets increased by $4 billion compared with the third quarter. This includes a $5.3 billion
increase in cash on deposit with the Federal Reserve and a $785 million increase in investment securities. On an
average, total loans decreased by $2.1 billion or about 2% compared with the previous quarter.
Looking at the loans by category on an average basis compared with the link quarter, commercial and industrial
loans declined by $1.4 billion or about 6%. That reflects a $1.6 billion decline in PPP loans, primarily reflecting
loan forgiveness. Our floor plan loans to vehicle dealers declined by $58 million on an average basis but grew by
$554 million on an end of period basis. All other C&I loans grew about 1% compared with the prior quarter.
Commercial real estate loans declined $830 million or about 2% compared with the third quarter. We've seen a
higher level of pay downs and payoffs of some of the troubled loans, often being refinanced by other lenders.
Residential real estate loans declined by $89 million or less than 1% as a result of principal repayments, as well
as the ongoing re-pooling of loans previously purchased from Ginnie Mae servicing pools. That was largely offset
by the retention of new loans originated and held for investment.
Consumer loans were up over 1%, reflecting growth in indirect auto loans and positive but seasonally slower
growth in recreation finance loans, partially offset by lower home equity lines of credit. Average core customer
deposits, which excludes CDs over $250,000, grew by $3.6 billion or 3% compared with the third quarter,
primarily reflecting non-interest bearing products.
Turning to net interest income – sorry, non-interest income. Non-interest income totaled $579 million in the fourth
quarter, compared with $569 million in the prior quarter. The increase reflects the $30 million distribution from
Bayview Lending Group that I previously mentioned. Mortgage banking revenues were $139 million in the recent
quarter, compared with $160 million in the linked quarter.
As we noted on the October call, we have begun to retain a significant majority, around 85%, of residential
mortgage originations to hold for investment on the balance sheet, which utilizes a portion of the excess liquidity
we currently have. This includes the roughly 20% normally held for investment.
As a result of increasing mortgage rates and the holiday slowdown, residential mortgage loan applications during
the most recent quarter amounted to $1.7 billion compared with $2.2 billion in the third quarter. Of those, we
recorded gains on sale on the $191 million that were locked for sale in the fourth quarter versus gain on sale on
the $1.1 billion that were locked in the third quarter.
Total residential mortgage banking revenues, including origination and servicing activities, were $91 million in the
fourth quarter, compared with $110 million in the prior quarter. The decrease reflects the lower level of loans
originated for sale, partially offset by gains from the sale of loans previously purchased from Ginnie Mae servicing
pools that, based on borrower re-performance, recently became saleable. Residential servicing revenues
improved slightly.
Commercial mortgage banking revenues totaled $48 million, encompassing both originations and servicing,
compared with $50 million in the third quarter. Recall that in the third quarter's commercial servicing results, they
included an $11 million fee for yield maintenance as a result of prepayment of previously securitized commercial
mortgage loans.

Trust income was $169 million in the recent quarter, improved from $157 million in the previous quarter. Business
remained solid with very strong capital markets activity, continued growth in retirement plan assets and higher
asset values. Service charges on deposits were $105 million in the recent quarter, unchanged from the third
quarter.
Heading to expenses, operating expenses for the fourth quarter, which exclude the amortization of intangible
assets and the merger related expenses were $904 million, compared with $888 million in the third quarter.
Salaries and benefits increased by $5 million from the prior quarter. This reflects in part higher levels of branch
staffing as customer traffic returns to normal and our ongoing program of adding on-payroll IT professionals. Data
processing and software increased by 6 million from third quarter, tied in part to higher business volumes, as well
as the cost from software licensing and maintenance.
The $6 million linked quarter increase in advertising and marketing reflects the beginning of the winter marketing
campaign, combined with incentives paid on new customer accounts. The efficiency ratio, which excludes
intangible amortization and merger related expenses from the numerator and the securities gains or losses from
the denominator was 59.7% in the linked quarter, compared with 57.7% in the third quarter.
It's cliché in sports that defense wins championships. In banking, credit is the defense. Let's take a look at credit.
While some sectors of the economy remain challenged by supply chain and labor constraints, credit trends overall
continue to improve even in the most severely impacted sectors. The allowance for credit losses declined by $46
million to $1.47 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. That reflects a $15 million recapture of previous provisions
for credit losses, combined with $31 million of net charge-offs in the quarter.
At December 31, the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans outstanding was 1.58% compared with
1.62% at September 30. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 13 basis points for the
fourth quarter, down slightly from 17 basis points in the third quarter. With the advantage of hindsight, it would
appear that criticized loans did indeed peak in the third quarter of 2021. And when we file our 10K, we expect to
report a noticeable decline in criticized loans, reflecting both payoffs and upgrades.
Non-accrual loans as of December 31 declined to $2.1 billion, a decrease of $182 million from the end of
September. Non-accrual loans as a percentage of loans outstanding were 2.22% compared with 2.4% at the end
of the prior quarter. Loans 90 days past due on which we continue to accrue interest were $963 million at the end
of the recent quarter. Of those loans, $928 million or 96% are guaranteed by government related entities. In a
difficult environment, one might argue, our credit is the top ranked defense in the league.
Turning to capital, M&T's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was an estimated 11.4% as of December 31 compared with
11.1% at the end of the third quarter. This reflects the impact of earnings in excess of dividends paid in slightly
higher risk weighted assets. As previously noted, we increased the quarterly common stock dividend by 9% this
quarter to $1.20 per share per quarter, raising the annual dividend rate to $4.80 per share.
Now turning to the outlook. As we look forward into 2022, we are pleased to see that the economy is improving,
evidenced by the fact that GDP is growing and unemployment is falling. However, these conditions are driving
inflation, which is impacting our cost structure, as well as that of our customers. It has also changed the outlook
for interest rates as the forward curve now has embedded a number of increases in both 2022 and 2023.
Our outlook considers these macro factors. Also, as we are still awaiting regulatory approval for our merger with
People's United, we will focus our comments on M&T standalone. That said there are no material changes to our

expectations for the financial impact and benefits of the merger. Of course, timing of those benefits will depend on
the date we close the merger and complete the conversion.
Starting with the balance sheet, there are a number of moving parts that will impact where we're headed. We
don't expect the $42 billion of cash on the balance sheet at the end of 2021 to endure through 2022. We're
managing deposit balances, both broker and customer relationships, that don't make economic sense in this rate
and liquidity environment.
We'd expect interest checking and MMDA accounts – balance, excuse me, to decline over the course of the year.
Our current plan is to continue securities purchases to increase the proportion of our liquid assets that are held in
longer duration assets and have higher yields. We expect to do this by replacing maturities and principal
amortization and to increase investment securities by an incremental $1 billion by the end of the year.
On the commercial side, PPP loans on our balance sheet amounted to $1.2 billion at year end. We expect a
significant majority of those loans will be largely repaid or forgiven in the first half of 2022. We've seen a
meaningful turnaround in vehicle inventory financing and we believe we're past the low point and expect growth in
2022 although not fully back to pre-pandemic levels.
The remainder of our C&I portfolio experienced growth this past quarter, and we believe we've also reached the
inflection point in these balances. We expect this growth to continue. The pandemic resulted in a slow pace of
new commercial real estate transactions over the past two years, putting pressure on balance growth. This leads
us to expect low single-digit declines in CRE balances in 2022. Our efforts to make this portfolio more capital
efficient should result in a transition to more fee income, less interest income, less use of the balance sheet, and
higher returns over time.
In connection with those efforts, we may seek to participate CRE loan exposures to third-parties while retaining
the customer relationships and loan servicing. These factors are reflected in our outlook for interest and fee
income.
As noted earlier, we're retaining a large majority of the mortgage loans we originate, which we expect will grow
balances by approximately $2.5 billion in 2022, depending on the level of refinance activity. Offsetting that growth
are $2.8 billion of mortgage loans purchased from Ginnie Mae servicing pools on our balance sheet at the end of
2021, more than half of which we believe will qualify for re-pooling over the course of 2022.
On average, we expect the residential real estate loan portfolio will contract during 2022. We expect more of the
same in the consumer portfolios with growth in indirect vehicle financing being partially offset by continued
pressures on home equity balances.
Taking all of this into account, the balance headwinds from PPP and Ginnie Mae buyouts will lead to average
balance declines in 2022. However, excluding those impacts, we expect aggregate loan growth to be in the low to
mid-single-digits. We expect net interest income to be down in the low to mid-single-digits on a year-over-year
basis. Growth in securities, retention of mortgage loan originations, and a return to growth in C&I loans will help
but not fully offset the lower benefits from the PPP loans and our interest rate hedging program.
We continue to expect net interest income to trough in the first quarter of the year and grow from there. That
should result in a net interest margin, little changed from full year 2021, in the area of 2.75%. Our forecast
incorporates three increases in short term interest rates, although the third increase occurs late enough in the
year to not have a meaningful impact on either net interest income or margin.

Turning to fees. As we noted, residential mortgage gain on sale revenues will be diminished in 2022 by our
programs to retain for investment a large portion of originations, although re-pooling of Ginnie Mae buyouts
should be a partial offset. Commercial originations and servicing, as well as residential mortgage servicing, should
still be solid. We see continued momentum in trust income based on the capital markets activity, continued growth
in retirement plan assets and possibly higher asset values.
We would need to see short term interest rates rise by 50 to 75 basis points before we can fully recover the
money fund fees we are currently waiving. Those amount to an annual run rate of approximately $50 million. We
expect service charges on deposit accounts to be down, with modest growth in commercial, offset by declines in
consumer largely related to changes in our overdraft practices. All in, we're looking for low single-digit growth in
non-interest revenues in 2022.
Turning to expenses. Non-interest operating expenses in 2021 grew at an uncharacteristically high rate, rising
5.6% over prior years. Lower profitability and growth led to decreased compensation costs in 2020. The recovery
and profitability in 2021 carried with it a return to more normal compensation costs which accounted for over half
of the increase. Our current estimate contemplates low to mid-single-digit operating expense growth in 2022. And
like 2021, salaries and benefits, data processing and software and advertising are the categories that will drive
the majority of the increase.
We would expect to see our typical seasonal surge in compensation expense during the year's first quarter. That
amount last year was approximately $69 million. And we're encouraged by the improvement in credit conditions
over the past several quarters. Overall, we expect net charge-offs to be consistent with the average of the past
two years, although it could be somewhat lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. We expect loss provisioning to normalize
as loan growth offsets potential decline in troubled credits.
Lastly, turning to capital. We've paused our buyback program while we wait to close the merger with People's
United. Since that pause, our CET1 ratio has increased by 140 basis points to 11.4%, leaving us positioned well
in excess of what we believe we need to run the combined company. Our focus, as always, will be on deploying
the excess capital we have beyond that needed to support growth in the business.
Of course, as you're aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions
regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other
macroeconomic factors which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.
Now, let's open up the call to questions, before which, Britney will briefly review the instructions.

Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
But anyway, on the deposit topic, I know you mentioned that checking balances and money market are likely to
decline. What is your overall deposit growth assumption as you look at 2022? And then related to that, what are
your deposit beta assumptions baked in? And maybe if you could talk about the sensitivities to 25 basis point rate
hike. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. So I guess I'll start with the latter. When we look at where we are with rates and the first set of increases,
our expectation is that the reactivity early on is really low, and that for the first probably 100 basis points of
increase the net interest margin would increase 9 to 12 basis points for each 25 of the first 100. And then we'll go
from there.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
When we look at the balance growth that we expect over the course of the year, we're really anticipating that
much of the cash that we have on hand will start to deploy or move off. There are some escrow balances that are
tied to the index that we expect will run off in the first part of the year. And when you look at the brokered money
market balances, those have a term on them and we expect those to decrease.
When you look at kind of the core balances on the balance sheet, we're really expecting fairly modest decreases
over the course of the year. There's the usual up-tick in commercial balances that you see at the end of the year,
that's part of what we saw in the fourth quarter, where our middle market and business customers hold on to – or
build up their balances for distributions, that usually happen in January and February.
We also saw an up-tick again in the fourth quarter in trust demand balances, which really reflect activity in the
M&A markets and the agency business. And so those should start to come down a little bit. But at the moment,
we're really not anticipating meaningful rundown in our core operating account balances for 2022.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Great. That's helpful. Thank you. And then separately, on the People's deal, I know you mentioned that
your forecast related to the deal remain unchanged. Anything else you can comment on in terms of the expected
timing around the closure of the deal? We've seen the bottleneck of delayed deals begin to clear here and so I
would...

Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. It's – we're kind of in the same boat we were in the fourth quarter, John, where we were pleased to see the
– as you've noted, the bottleneck clear and that things are happening. And we're hopeful that we'll receive positive
news here in the first quarter.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Hey, I wanted to just follow up on your comments about that excess liquidity
position and the securities. I think there's a perception that you might have gotten more aggressive. I heard you
just say that you're only expecting to build the book by about $1 billion over runoff. And, I guess, can you just give
us updated thoughts on how you're looking at the mix of earning assets, presuming that those deposits do shrink?
And with kind of an in and out, as you mentioned in your loan growth guide, how you just expect for the overall
composition of the book to look from like a loans or earning assets perspective. Thanks, Darren.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Sure. There's a lot to unpack in the question, Ken. So, just starting with the cash and the securities. If you think
about uses of the cash, there's two that we've been looking at. One is retaining our mortgage production. And
that's a way to get some duration and some yield. And so, we're taking that on the balance sheet instead of in the
securities portfolio in MBS.

And when you look in the securities portfolio, over the last quarter we've kind of shifted a little bit to shorter
duration treasuries, kind of two to three years as the curve reshaped. And so, we'll continue to build that portfolio,
but we're being patient because we see where rates are headed.
And so, we're trying to trade off the incremental spread that you can get by putting more securities on the books
with the downside of the mark-to-market risk that goes through your OCI and affects your tangible book value.
And so, that's what's on our mind as we look through those balances.
The other thing to keep in mind as we talk about the brokered money markets and CDs coming off, that will be a
use of some of that cash. And we also expect to see some use with People's when the two banks come together.
And so, the cash, we're watching it closely. We don't love having such excess balances that don't earn much, but
at the same token, we want to make sure we're careful with how we start to deploy it.
When you look at the balance sheet and the earning assets in total, so given that decrease in cash, that would be
the largest driver of a decrease in earning assets in our forecast of 2022 over 2021, but doesn't have as
meaningful an impact on NII, obviously, because they're very low margin.
When I look underneath and what I get excited about looking into 2022, is that across all of our portfolios, holding
the specials, which I'll get to in a second, aside, whether it's C&I, whether it's residential mortgage, or whether it's
consumer, we're expecting growth in those portfolios. And we do expect a decrease, a slight decrease in the CRE
portfolio over the course of the year for the reasons that we've talked about as we both reshape our go-to-market
strategy there so that we can actually provide better service to our clients as well as just the normal course of
construction loans paying down and reaching their end.
And so, when you take that, which is the core of the bank, it's actually low to mid-single-digit growth in those
portfolios. What I would refer to or I refer to as the specials, one is the PPP loans. And so when you look at those
on an average basis, in 2021 they averaged about $4 billion. And that average in 2022 is down to about $0.5
billion, and so that's got a meaningful impact on the printed loan growth.
And then the same thing with the Ginnie Mae buyouts, where on average basis, in 2021, they were around $3.5
billion. And we think as those re-pool and we put them back into the servicing portfolio and do the gain on sale
that those drop to about $1.6 billion. And so when you when you look at – on average.
So when you look at the, what I would refer to as the specials, you kind of see a decrease in those balances. But
that's the things that have happened over the course of – over 2021 and 2020. And so as we exit 2022, we start
to have a more contemporary balance sheet that starts to skew a little bit more towards C&I and a little less cash
on the balance sheet, which overall should start to see the margin increase and allow us to benefit from the rising
rate environment.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi, Darren.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Morning, Gerard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
I'm with you. A strong defense does win the big games, but when you're behind you have to have a hurry-up
offense. So, with that in mind, and your capital levels being so high, how aggressive can you be after the People's
deal in buying back your stock or using that excess capital to bring that CET1 ratio down to a more normal level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Well, Gerard, that's a good question. We could debate whether capital is offense or defense. But certainly, to your
point, holding 11.4% CET1, which I think will post quite high relative to the peers when we're finished with the
year, is a higher level of capital than, obviously, we believe we need to run the combined organization given the
credit emphasis of both of those organizations.
When you look at People's history of strong underwriting and you look at how our results have held up over the
course of the last couple years, and the improvements we're seeing in the portfolio, we definitely see an
opportunity to bring that down, and we will look to bring those ratios down over the course of 2022.
Where the actual target and how fast we'll get down there will be will kind of be dependent on when we close and
convert the merger. But as you think about targets of where we'd like to be and think about where we were kind of
pre-pandemic, that's a good place to think about where we might end up over the course of the next six quarters
or something like that once you get through the deal.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then as a follow-up, you touched on credit quality, obviously, your net charge-offs are remarkably
low, similar to some others in the industry, but that's a hallmark for you folks. Then can you share with us what
you said about being taken out on some of the classified loans by competitors? What were the flows in and out of
the non-performers, especially with the hotel loans and the hospitality and leisure industry?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yes, happy to. Well, you'll see the full print when we put the 10-K out. But if you look at where the decrease was
over the quarter, was predominantly in the hotel and retail space. And when you look at the hotel portfolio, what
we're seeing is – we're seeing a couple things, we're seeing upgrades, because when we look at our – at the
activity that's happening in the hotel space, when you get to resort oriented hotels or ones that are more suburban
and drive up, we've seen occupancy rates come back and being very strong.

There's still some challenges in the larger city hotels as business travel isn't quite back to where it was, but they're
off their pandemic lows. And then some of the – when we look at some of the properties that have been
refinanced by others, no matter what class it is, what we're finding is there are other institutions that are coming in
and offering terms that might be interest-only for one or two years and not fully amortizing, which for many of
these properties is a very attractive alternative.
What's kind of interesting about it is, if we were to restructure those loans to a similar thing, similar setup, it would
be a troubled debt restructure for us, but for someone else, it's a new loan. And so, it's one of those things where I
guess I'd rather have a pay-off than a charge-off. And so that's part of what's helping bring down both the
criticized and the non-accruals.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Spahr Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thank you. Good afternoon. So my question is just, now that you're kind of getting under the hood with People's, I
mean, you took a merger charge this quarter, is there anything that's going to surprise you on the upside? And
also on a related note, People's has a larger share of securities as a percent of earning assets, much larger than
what you have on your balance sheet, is that kind of why you're a little bit more cautious in adding more securities
on your own portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Excellent question and observation, Chris, that's definitely one of the things that is on our mind as we think about
the securities portfolio, not just the size of it but the composition of it. Now, if you look within the People's portfolio,
there's a large municipal bond portfolio there, which gives you a little bit different duration and composition. And
so as we think about the cash that we have and how we want to build up our securities portfolio, we're taking that
into account.
As I mentioned before, we're also taking into account some of the other funding sources that People's has on their
balance sheet that we would be able to reduce that funding and lower our overall cost of funding with the cash
balances that we have. Obviously, we're all in the same banking industry so they're still also seeing some cash
balances grow as well and are looking to deploy them, but that's absolutely part of our thought process and
patience on putting that cash to work.
And I guess as we've gone through the merger preparation process, we just continued to be excited by the
combination of the two organizations. The cultures between the two couldn't be more similar. The focus on clients

and the focus on geographies, the opportunity to have complementary products, that is encouraging and we're
just, between both organizations, anxious to be able to go to market as one unified team because everyone can
see the potential.
Is there anything really new from what we saw going in? The answer is probably no. We continue to be excited
about the opportunity to grow the small business segment within the People's portfolio, and bring some of our
treasury management into the C&I space. We're both pretty solid at commercial real estate. When you look at
what we have from People's, there's some unique segments that they serve that we can bring to our client base,
their leasing equipment finance, small ticket leasing, some of the fund lending, as well as some of the niche
businesses they have, like the mortgage warehouse lending.
And so we think the combination, we're still excited about it, they're very complementary. We love the funding
deposit franchise that they have, and so no real big upsides in terms of new things, but certainly continued
enthusiasm for what we saw back almost a year ago.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Spahr Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And if I could just, one quick follow-up. How quickly can you close the deal? Say, if the merger is approved
tomorrow, how quickly can you close it and start integration process? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Sure. So, by law, there's a 15-day cool off period once the approval is granted, and so technically, 15 days is your
fastest. Usually, you're within that time period, plus or minus a week, depending on trying to manage things like
month ends and quarter ends and the like. But that's kind of generally the timeframe. And then once that's done,
then you try to lock down a time to do your system conversion.
And so the complicating factor there is, when you're merging with an organization that has a number of outside
contracts and outsourcing where some of their technology is provided by third party, you got to coordinate with
that third party to make that happen. And so we think it's probably in the order of 120 to 150 days post legal close
that you can do the system conversion, and then you probably try and time it around a long weekend to the extent
that you can just because it helps de-risk that system integration.
But obviously, our mutual desire is for a quick close and as quickly as possible, a conversion, so that we can get
on to the things that I mentioned before, talking to customers and driving business.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Quick one on the loan side, it sounded like the floor plan segment was really strong this quarter. Can you just give
an update on the dynamics you're seeing in that market and what your outlook is there? It sounds like maybe you
have some more momentum there, so just curious what you're hearing from customers and how much you expect
that to contribute to loan growth this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Sure. Yeah. And on an end of period basis, we saw the floor plan loans up, just over $500 million which, typically,
you would see an uptick in the fourth quarter. There is a pattern to that business that you see balances built in the
fourth quarter and a little bit into the first and then as those inventories get sold, and ultimately the dealers clear
out their lots of one model a year to prepare for the next, you see a decrease in the third quarter. And so, that
pattern had shifted a little bit for the last 18 months, I would say, and it's mainly been a decrease. So we were
pleased to see some balances come back, and it's really about the level of production.
And so, if you looked from a dealer's perspective, they love the current situation where the inventory is low and
both time on lot is low, that's very helpful for their profitability. But you see the manufacturers ramp up and that's
what was reflected in our auto floor plan growth. We expect that ramp up to continue. The SAR last year in 2021
was the lowest it's been in a while at $14 million, $15 million – or 14 million, 15 million vehicle level. I think we got
as high as 17 million, 17.5 million pre-pandemic. And so we'll see that start to come back.
One of the things that you're seeing in the dealers is the shift to electric. And so, I think there's some changeover
that you're seeing that's compromising that volume in the short-term. And so our expectation for floor plan over
the course of the year is that we'll see balances and utilization rates tick up, not all the way back to what they
were pre-pandemic but maybe two-thirds of the way back in 2022, and then the rest of the way back in – excuse
me, about half of the way back in 2022, 75% of the way back in 2023, and then by the time we get to the start of
2024, you're probably back to where you were pre-pandemic.
And it's just going through that change within the manufacturing world that will drive the pace of inventory buildup
at the dealers. But, long story short, it's a positive thing to see those volumes going. It's good for clients and good
for the economy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC

And maybe just a real quick one on deal timing. I know you're really limited as to what you can say, and
appreciate the color you've given so far. I was just curious if you're still kind of getting requests for information or
in an info exchange or whatever with the regulators or if that process is completed and you are just waiting on an
answer at this point.

Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. It's what I would describe as by and large the normal process with back and forth with questions. And
what's abnormal, obviously, is the time and some of the things that are happening around Washington and we're
just got our fingers crossed and we're waiting to solve it. Fingers crossed [indiscernible] (00:50:29) more dire than
it is. I think it's just being patient that – while Washington gets through the backlog and the optimist is that it's
happening, right? We saw some deals get approved and we expect it to continue.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yes. Sounds good. One last one on the securities purchases. Appreciated all the color you gave there. Was just
wondering if there's any kind of sensitivity around – as it relates to the steepness of the curve. So if we were to
see a more material steepening than you guys are looking for, if maybe that could make you more comfortable
with picking up some more volume there. And sorry if I missed the bit, can you talk about what your expectation is
at this point for the long end of the curve that you've got baked into your NII and margin estimates? That'd be
great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Sure. We've got obviously a lot of liquidity to put to work. And when we think about the securities portfolio, the
steepness helps. What we will probably pay a little bit more attention to is not just the steepness but where the
short end is. When we look at some of the cash we've been deploying, we've been deploying it in mortgages, as I
mentioned, through the balance sheet as opposed to through the securities portfolio. And so instead of having
MBS, we're actually putting mortgages on the balance sheet and getting some duration in yield that way. And so
on the securities portfolio, we've tended to skew a little bit recently towards the shorter end of the curve. So kind
of in the two to three-year space. And so that's really where we've been watching and looking.
And one of the things that we'll pay attention to from a shape of the curve perspective is where the forward rates
are. And if we start to see the forward rates move, one of the other ways that we'll start to try and take some of
that assets sensitivity off the table, maybe it will be through the hedging program and restarting the hedging
program depending on what we see there.
So there's a lot of different avenues that we're thinking about, both to protect and grow net interest income as well
as to put the cash to work. And it's just thinking through all the alternatives, not just M&T but the combined M&T
with People's and managing the assets sensitivity across the balance sheet, the securities portfolio and hedging
and making sure that we're getting – maximizing yield without over hedging at the same time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC

Operator: And we'll take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now
open.

Good morning.

Darren J. King A

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I just want to circle back on the loan growth. I think you mentioned CRE balances, low single-digits in 2022. I'm
just – if you don't mind, talk to us in terms of, if you look beyond 2022, is it possible that this portfolio remains a
drag on overall loan growth as you move towards the fee-driven strategy? And give us an update in terms of the
growth market on the fee side, how quickly will that start hitting the ground running? By then you should see the
revenue impact from it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. I think as it relates to the CRE portfolio, the way to think about it is, the decrease in balances will be
consistent but slow. And what we're looking to do is more on a prospective basis as we work with our existing
clients, as well as new ones, and we're helping them finance their properties, that we'll look to use a mix of both
our balance sheet as well as the balance sheet of others.
And so what will happen is the rate of growth – our new originations will slow and that will be what drives the
decline, because there's normal amortization and there's normal pay-offs that happen. But obviously, as we make
that shift, then we'll start to grow the fees. And the fee income will come. They will probably lag slightly the net
interest income.
But the flip side of that is that it reduces the capital required to support that, and so that allows us to both improve
the economics of the individual deals, but then to manage our balance sheet and manage our equity levels, and
either deploy it into other high yielding customer segments and asset types or to deploy it back to shareholders.
And so, when we think about it, from a EPS perspective and return perspective, while the balances might decline,
it is in our opinion additive to returns and additive to EPS.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q

It'll be a year before that stuff starts to happen and it'll grow as we go through 2023 and 2024.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just a second question on loan growth around retention of mortgages, is there a certain level that
you're targeting in terms of how big that book can get relative to the overall portfolio? Just give us your thought
process on when you may make the pivot again, retention versus selling some of that production?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. I guess, as we look forward, I think it's safe to say that for 2022, we'll be retaining most of those mortgages
and perhaps into 2023, we'll look at where gain on sale margins are and what constraints, if any, the mortgages
are putting on the balance sheet. We'll think about whether or not we want to hold MBS in the future instead of
having the mortgages on the balance sheet. As rates move up, then you start to reduce some of that convexity
risk that sits in the MBS portfolio and we might think about shifting some of the balances there as well.
If you went back and looked at our balance sheet through time, you would see that the mortgage balances
peaked when we acquired Hudson City, and we came down from there. So, that would probably be the upper
bound. I don't think we'd get to that level. But, overall, our objective is to maintain a diversified balance sheet
across geographies and customer segments and asset classes. And so, the mortgage portfolio got a little bit
smaller through the course of the last few years and we'll look to build it back up.
Where the ending point is, again, we'll come back with a little bit more detail there. The reason I'm not giving a
specific target is Hudson City has mortgages on their balance sheet as well. And when we put the two
organizations together – sorry, People's, [indiscernible] (00:58:00) on my mind. I'm sorry. I'm having PTSD. When
we combine with People's, they also have mortgages on their balance sheet.
So, again, like we talked about with the securities portfolio, we're thinking about not just what we look like by
ourselves, but what the combined organization and balance sheet might look like. So we're taking that into
account as well.

Good afternoon. Just wanted to ask a few follow up questions. Darren, on the 9 to 12 basis point of NIM
sensitivity to each 25, I just wanted to make sure I heard it right, that includes the ramp in terms of deposit
repricing that you experienced in the first 100? And is that 9 to 12 basis points on a static balance sheet or a
dynamic balance sheet?

Good question. It is on a dynamic balance sheet. And it's 9 to 12 basis points per 25 for the first 100.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Right. Sorry. Yes. Yes. And so, what's the deposit beta underneath the 9 to 12 basis points for 25?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Well, it depends, and that's why we got the range. There's some part of the deposits that are pegged to the index
and so if it's just those that move then you're down in kind of a 5% to 10% range of deposit reactivity. If it happens
to get all the way up to 25% to 30%, then you would get to the lower end of that range. But I think we believe,
much like others, that with all the excess deposits in the system and excess liquidity that the reactivity, at least for
the first few hikes, with the exception of those that are tied to an index, will be pretty low.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And Darren, the stock did turn when you gave your guidance for expenses being up low to mid-single digits
on a standalone basis. And if we want to take the football analogy further, in a 3% to 5%, I guess how much is
offense versus defense, right, in terms of how much are you pulling forward some investment spend versus the
cost inflationary catch up? And you said 5.2% was not a normal rate of growth for expenses for M&T, is 3% to 5%
the new normal? Or low to mid-single digits the new normal?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Well, I guess, I'll start with it's hard to say what the new normal is given the inflationary environment we're in. If we
step back and we give context, if you look at our expense growth, compound annual growth rate over the last two
years, it's actually under 2%. I think it's about 1.6% or 1.7%. And so, what happened was, when we took the
actions we did in 2020 to adjust some of our expenses given the environment we were operating in, most notably
compensation, that we actually had a decrease in 2020 compared to most others who had an increase. And so it
came back in 2022 – or 2021, excuse me.
And so when you look over the course of the average over those two years, we're talking 2% expense growth,
which in this inflation environment is pretty good and pretty consistent with M&T's long-term average. And so
when we think about 2022 in the 3% to 5%, there's a couple things going on there. One is just when you look at
the changes that happened over the course of 2021 and where we ended the year, it's annualizing the run rate of
the fourth quarter, bakes in some growth just by itself.
And then on top of that, as we mentioned, we start to come back to a more normal environment and we see
advertising and promotion expenses come back closer to what they were pre-pandemic, although not all the way
back. And then as we talk about investments, the software and outside data processing, I mean, outside data
processing is largely tied to volume. And so as we see fee income growth, we're going to see expense growth;
and a lot of the software licensing and maintenance as we continue to make our investments in the franchise and
we shift more to buying software rather than developing it ourselves and using the cloud that you see some of
those expenses move up.

And obviously, as we make those investments, they will have countervailing impacts on other parts of the
organization, notably in professional services and salary and benefits costs. But there'll be a timing mismatch.
And so those should help us moderate expense growth in the forward years, but some of it is just the timing of
when these changes occurred in 2021, and then their full year impact in 2022.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi. I want to come back to the balance sheet. And I know you've touched on a lot of these pieces, but I'm sitting
here and I'm hearing deposits down, the only bank I cover where they're talking about deposits down, loans down,
securities not really growing after you shrank it kind of 75%. And I get it, right, like you're the best bank at PPP
relative to your size so it could be a drag. You probably had the most Ginnie Mae buyouts, which is very profitable
relative to your size, but it just doesn't feel right kind of where we are in the economy.
And I guess I come back and wonder like are you missing some things on the loan origination side, right? Like a
lot of your peers have gotten in the capital markets which create some large corporate opportunities in the lending
side, they've acquired point-of-sale. I'm not sure how economically attractive all these things are, but like they're
doing things to improve their asset generation. And I know you've been very conservative in the past, you talked
about playing defense and you tend to do extremely well kind of in the credit cycle. But I'm just wondering is there
something more that's needed on the asset generation side if we get this multiyear recovery that many people
think we'll get?

Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. I appreciate the clarification. We'll go back through some of the categories. When we look at the C&I
portfolio and our expected growth rate there which would include what we talked about in the floor plan business
as well as other C&I, we're actually expecting growth in 2022 on an average and end-of-period basis that's low
double-digits.
When we look at residential mortgage growth as we retain the balances on an average basis, we think that's mid-
single-digit growth, and the consumer business is up upper single-digits. The only one portfolio where there's
some decreases is the CRE portfolio and that's for all the reasons we've talked about. When you put all those
together, you've got kind of mid-single-digit growth in the core portfolio, which I think is consistent with what we're
seeing and how we're thinking about the world and taking advantage of the growth that's out there. It's the size of
the PPP and how well we did in 2020 and 2021 that is affecting the average and the total. And then the other
piece is the Ginnie Maes. But outside of those things, we're seeing the growth that you're talking about.
When you talk about deposits, the core deposits and the core operating accounts of our customers, we're not
expecting material decreases. It's some of the deposits where they're tied to an index and they would not be what
we can consider core operating accounts that we're anticipating some decline, and whether that's the brokered
money market and brokered CDs as well as escrow balances. And so we're just continuing to look to optimize
those balances and deploy that excess cash in a way that is additive to clients without – and being shareholder
friendly.
And so I guess when I look forward at 2022, you make it sound dire, actually, I feel as optimistic as I've been in
the last 18 months about the prospects for all the reasons that you talked about. It's just the – it's a little bit difficult

with some of the moving parts on the balance sheet. But when I look forward at what we've got in front of us,
whether it's deploying the excess cash, it's growing the assets as we talked about, deploying the excess capital,
there's a number of opportunities and options that we have in front of us to continue to grow the bank and make
2022 and beyond the same M&T that we're used to seeing. And so it's just getting through some of these
transitions that are happening on the balance sheet, but underneath, I think things look really good.
