Q4 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2024
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Regions Financial Corporation's Quarterly Earnings Call. My name
is Christine, and I'll be your operator for today's call. I would like to remind everyone that all participant phone
lines have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session.
[Operator Instructions]
I will now turn the call over to Dana Nolan to begin.

Dana W. Nolan
Executive Vice President & Head-Investor Relations, Regions Financial Corp.
Thank you, Christine. Welcome to Regions' fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. John and David will provide high-
level commentary regarding our results. Earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statement
disclaimer and non-GAAP information, are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. These
disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments and Q&A.
I will now turn the call over to John.

John M. Turner, Jr.
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Thank you, Dana, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. This morning, we
reported full-year 2023 earnings of $2 billion, reflecting record pre-tax pre-provision income of $3.2 billion and one
of the best returns on average tangible common equity in our peer group at 22%. Our results speak to and
underscore the comprehensive work that's taken place over the past decade to position the company to generate
consistent, sustainable earnings regardless of the economic environment we're experiencing.
We've enhanced our credit and interest rate risk management processes and platforms, while sharpening our
focus on risk-adjusted returns and capital allocation. Although the industry continues to face headwinds from
lingering economic and geopolitical uncertainty, as well as the continued evolution of the regulatory framework,
we feel confident about our positioning and adaptability heading into 2024. We'll continue to benefit from our
strong and diverse balance sheet, solid capital and liquidity, and prudent credit risk management.
Our proactive hedging strategies continue to position us for success in an array of economic conditions, and our
desirable footprint, granular deposit base and relationship banking approach will continue to serve us well. Our
strategic plan continues to deliver consistent, sustainable long-term performance, as we focus on soundness,
profitability and growth. In closing, I'm excited to work alongside the 20,000 Regions associates who put
customers and their needs at the center of all we do and focus on doing the right things the right way every day.
Now, Dave will provide some highlights regarding the quarter.

David J. Turner, Jr.
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Average and ending loans decreased modestly on a
sequential quarter basis, while ending loans grew a little over 1% compared to the prior year. Within the business

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2024
portfolio, average and ending loans declined 1% quarter-over-quarter. We are remaining judicious preserving
capital for business where we can have a full relationship. Loan demand remains soft as clients continue to
exhibit cautious behavior.
We are seeing clients make long-term investments when they have to. But if they can defer, they're holding off. In
general, sentiment varies across industries, with some continuing to expect growth, while others have a more
muted outlook. Average and ending consumer loans remained relatively stable, as growth in mortgage and
EnerBank was partially offset by declines in home equity and the GreenSky exit portfolio sale we completed this
quarter. Looking forward, we expect 2024 average loan growth to be in the low single-digits.
From a deposit standpoint, deposits increased modestly on an average and ending basis, primarily due to the
increases in interest-bearing business products, which we expect will partially reverse with tax season in the first
quarter. Across all three businesses, we continued to experience remixing from noninterest-bearing to interest-
bearing deposits. However, the pace of remixing has slowed.
Within Consumer, we continue to see balance normalization, but we believe the pace of remixing will continue to
slow as short-term market rates appear to have peaked and the relationship of checking balances to spending
levels is getting closer to pre-pandemic levels. Our overall views on deposit balances and rates are unchanged.
We expect incremental remixing out of low-cost savings and checking products of between $2 billion and $3
billion and total balances stabilizing by mid-year. This results in a noninterest-bearing mix percentage remaining
in the low-30% range.
So, let's shift to net interest income. Net interest income declined by approximately 4.5% in the quarter, driven
mostly by a deposit cost and mix normalization, as well as the start of the active period on $3 billion of
incremental hedging. Asset yields benefited from the maturity and replacement of lower-yielding fixed rate loans
and securities. Notably, during the quarter, we've returned to full reinvestment of paydowns in the securities
portfolio and added $500 million over and above that to the portfolio balance, taking advantage of attractive
market rate and spread levels.
Interest-bearing deposit costs were 2.14% in the quarter, representing a 39% rising rate cycle beta. Growth in
higher cost corporate deposits increased our reported deposit betas by approximately 1%, but allowed for the
termination of all outstanding FHLB advances. This and a more pronounced slowing in the pace of rate-seeking
behavior by retail customers drove modest net interest income outperformance compared to expectations.
As we look to 2024, we expect net interest income trends to stabilize over the first half of the year and grow over
the back half of the year. $3 billion of additional forward starting hedges in the first quarter and further late-cycle
deposit remixing will be a headwind. However, we expect deposit trends to continue to improve, with interest-
bearing betas peaking in the mid-40% range. The benefits of fixed rate asset turnover will persist, overcoming the
headwinds and driving net interest income growth in the second half of the year.
With respect to outlook, we expect full-year 2024 net interest income to be between $4.7 billion and $4.8 billion.
Our guidance assumes four 25 basis point rate cuts, with long-term rates remaining stable from year-end.
However, the path for net interest income is well-insulated from changes in market interest rates. The primary
driver of net interest income in 2024 will be deposit performance. The lower end of our expected 2024 net interest
income range assumes a 25% beta as rates fall, while the higher end assumes a deposit beta similar to what we
have experienced during the rising rate environment.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2024
In a falling rate environment, we are prepared to manage deposit costs lower to protect the margin. A relatively
small portion of interest-bearing deposit balances is responsible for the majority of the deposit cost increase this
cycle. These market price deposits include indexed and other high beta corporate deposit types that will reprice
immediately with Fed funds. The other primary contributor is CDs with a seven-month average maturity. While
these products will lag in a falling rate environment, we are positioned to offset this cost.
So, let's take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted noninterest income increased 2% during the quarter,
as a sequential decline in capital markets was offset by modest increases in most other categories. Full-year
adjusted noninterest income declined 5%, primarily due to reductions in capital markets and mortgage income, as
well as the impact of the company's Overdraft Grace feature implemented late in the second quarter. Partially
offsetting these declines were new records in 2023 for both treasury management and wealth management
revenue. With respect to outlook, we expect full-year 2024 adjusted noninterest income to be between $2.3 billion
and $2.4 billion.
Let's move on to noninterest expense. Reported noninterest expense increased 8% compared to the prior quarter,
but included two significant adjusted items, $119 million for the FDIC special assessment and $28 million in
severance-related costs. Adjusted noninterest expense decreased 5%, driven primarily by lower operational
losses.
Full-year adjusted noninterest expense increased 9.7% or approximately 6% excluding elevated operational
losses experienced primarily in the second and third quarters. We remain committed to prudently managing
expenses to fund investments in our business. We will continue focusing on our largest expense categories,
which include salaries and benefits, occupancy and vendor spend. We expect full-year 2024 adjusted noninterest
expenses to be approximately $4.1 billion.
From an asset quality standpoint, overall credit performance continues to normalize as expected. Reported
annualized net charge-offs for the fourth quarter increased 14 basis points. However, excluding the impact of the
GreenSky loan sale, adjusted net charge-offs decreased 1 basis point versus the prior quarter to 39 basis points.
Full-year adjusted net charge-offs were 37 basis points.
Total nonperforming loans and business services criticized loans increased during the quarter. Nonperforming
loans as a percentage of total loans increased to 82 basis points, due primarily to downgrades within industries
previously identified as higher risk. Keep in mind, between 2013 and 2019, our average NPL ratio was 107 basis
points. We expect to see further normalization towards these levels in 2024. Provision expense was $155 million
or $23 million in excess of net charge-offs, and includes an $8 million net provision expense related to the
consumer loan sale.
The allowance for credit loss ratio increased 3 basis points to 1.73%. Excluding the loan portfolio sold during the
quarter, the allowance for credit loss ratio would have increased 6 basis points. The increase to our allowance
was primarily due to adverse risk migration and continued credit quality normalization, as well as higher
qualitative adjustments for incremental risk in certain higher risk portfolios. Our average net charge-offs from 2013
to 2019 were 46 basis points. We've seen modest acceleration towards these normalized levels in recent
quarters. As a result, we expect our full-year 2024 net charge-off ratio to be between 40 basis points and 50 basis
points.
Turning to capital and liquidity, given the evolution of the regulatory environment, we expect to maintain our
common equity Tier 1 ratio around 10% over the near term. This level will provide sufficient flexibility to meet the
proposed changes along the implementation timeline, while supporting strategic growth objectives and allow us to

continue to increase the dividend commensurate with earnings. We ended the year with an estimated common
equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.2%, while executing $252 million in share repurchases and $223 million in common
dividends during the quarter.
With that, we'll move to the Q&A portion of the call.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our
first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. Appreciate the comments on the main levers for NII
– or within NII for your guidance. I was hoping you could discuss a little more about the deposit repricing thoughts
that you had. Maybe specifically, thoughts about sort of the bifurcation between commercial and consumer
deposits, and then just any opportunities you've seen – with the Fed already having – sort of peaked out
presumably, any opportunities you've had already to maybe take some actions to ease the pressure on costs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Sure. Scott, this is David. One important thing to note is that about 30% of our customer base is really the driver
of our interest-bearing deposit beta. If you look at that, little over half of that's related to our commercial book, and
those deposits are indexed. So, to the extent the Fed changes rates, those [indiscernible] (00:15:24) that
changes. So, you're talking about roughly 55%, almost 60% of that'll come down as rates come down. The other
represents consumer deposits. So, these have been CDs and money market accounts there, where we've seen
migration out of noninterest-bearing accounts.
The money market piece – both of these have to be competitive. We have to watch what our competitors are
doing to some degree. But we have mechanisms to really start working that down. Part of that is making sure we
don't go too long on our CD maturities. So, we've been fairly short. I think I mentioned in the prepared comments,
our average CD term is seven months. And so, we don't want to extend that much going forward. As a matter of
fact, we'd like to shorten that to coincide with what we think is going to happen with the Fed. And we have four
cuts baked in to our guidance to hit the midpoint of our guidance, which is on page 6 of our presentation. And we
think that starts probably at the May meeting. And we know that's different than what the market participants
believe. But we think that that's going to – I think it's going to be slower versus faster.
It's important to note we're neutral to short-term rates. And so, it's all about managing our deposit costs, and I
think we have a good plan to do so. We've given you really a range. It's a pretty tight range on NII performance on
the page 6, and we've kind of talked about betas. So, if our betas kind of follow what we had and as rates have
gone up, we're 39% today. We said we'd probably finish in the mid-40s. If we have that coming back down, then
we'll be at the upper end of our range. If we're only at 25% beta as rates come down, knowing things won't match
perfectly, then we'd be at the lower end of the range. So, our midpoint is the 35% beta, which we think is very
doable, in particular relative to that half of that – a little over half of that is related to indexed deposit on the
commercial side.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect. Thanks for that color, David. And then, maybe on the lending side, you noted soft client demand, which is
very understandable. Just curious, how you expect demand to trend as the year unfolds.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Scott, this is John. I would – our current projections are we believe the economic activity picks up toward
the second half of the year, and we believe we will experience some growth in core middle market banking and
small business banking through our Ascentium platform, asset-based lending, which would be typical of this
period of time. And then, on the Consumer side, mortgage and EnerBank continue to contribute to growth. Again,
any growth we have will be modest and that will occur likely toward the back half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Perfect. All right. Thank you all very much.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please proceed
with your question.

Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Good morning.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. Just maybe wanted to follow up on the fee income guide. Maybe if we can drill into where do
you see growth across fee revenue, particularly on what are you assuming in there for capital markets? It was a
weak-ish fourth quarter? So, would love to hear outlook on capital markets income within fees. And then, do you
expect to do more purchases for mortgage servicing rights as you did in the quarter and should that boost
mortgage income? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, your – it's David. So, your first point on capital markets, we had a pretty tough capital markets finish in
the fourth quarter. Bit of that is timing. We think some deals, in particular in the M&A world, got pushed into the
first quarter. The rate environment has really hampered our real estate Corporate Banking income line a bit. We
think those rebound, both of those rebound. We think M&A can – has a tendency – a chance to pick up probably
towards the back half of the year, as we've seen a little bit of rate relief, if you will. So, we have a pretty good feel
about our capital markets rebound for 2024.
Relative to mortgage servicing rights, as you know, we have a good capital position. We look to support our
business to grow our loan book. We think loan growth will be muted. So, we look to other ways to put the capital
to work. Mortgage servicing rights has been one of those. We feel good about that asset class because we're
good at it. We're the low-cost servicing group, and we're looking to grow when packages make sense and the
economics work to our advantage. We've done a number of those on the market. If we can hit the mid that we

have to make sure we get an appropriate risk-adjusted return, we'll do that. We suspect there'll be a couple of
opportunities during the year as there usually are. But we have room to grow that without adding a lot of fixed
overhead – have to add people to do the servicing, but we don't have to add a lot of fixed overhead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. I'd just add two things, Ebrahim. One is we continue to grow consumer checking accounts and consumer
households. That contributes to growth. Secondly, we've had a – had the best year we probably ever had in
treasury management, as we see increases in the number of operating accounts that we are – that we're
originating and services we're providing to customers. And then finally, Wealth Management had maybe the best
year it's had, certainly in some time, and we expect Wealth Management fee revenue to continue to grow in 2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's helpful. And just one other one, David. I guess the one flex on deposit pricing is your loan-to-deposit ratio
at 77%. Just give us a sense of, is this steady state in somewhere in the mid to high-70s where you see running
the bank going forward? Or if rates get cut, you could see this ratio drift into the 80s, and that probably provide
you some pricing flexibility? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, we really don't run the bank trying to solve for our loan-to-deposit ratio. It's just kind of result of all of
our activities that we have. At 77%, we're a little bit lower than the peer median about 2, 3 points. It gives us some
flexibility to not have to put a lot of pressure on the deposit base. Remember, my opening comments were we
want to be fairly balanced with regards to our customers, making sure that we're competitive, but we don't have to
push, we don't have to be at the upper end of pricing just to maintain those deposits. We have a good core
deposit base, and it gives us flexibility to not have to chase with rate. And that's why our deposit costs have a
tendency to be a bit lower across the board.

Hi. Good morning. I think you mentioned earlier on in the call that clients are deferring longer term investments if
they can. Can you talk about what's driving that? Is it just rates and waiting for rates to come down? Is part of it
the environment that they need more certainty there? So, any light on your conversations there would be helpful.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2024
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think probably all of the above. Clearly, rising interest rates that have had some impact. Rising cost, cost
of goods, cost of labor has had an impact. And then, uncertainty related to the economy, geopolitical conditions,
the political environment here in the US, all have, I think, created some restraint. Borrowers are, I believe, more
optimistic today than they were 60 to 90 days ago, and that's in line with what appear to be improving economic
conditions, but still reluctant to initiate long-term investments currently just based upon the things that I described.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
So, as we think about deposit betas, when rates go down – I think you and a number of your peers have
suggested that, okay, loan growth will accelerate as we get a resolution in some of these matters and as rates go
down. But then, on the flip side, does that mean that deposit competition picks back up? I'm just trying to assess
the level of confidence on the high-end, low-end of that range of that 25% to 45% down beta?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, we still think loan growth for the year is going to be relatively muted. And competition for deposits has
always been fairly intense. What you don't want to do is use rate. You want to have a relationship banking model,
which is what we do. We leverage off of the checking account of the consumer and the operating account of a
business, and with that comes all other type of funding. For us, we have no wholesale borrowings to speak of. We
paid off all of our FHLB advances. So, we have the ability to lever up there to cover incremental growth without
having to reprice our deposit base. So, if there's incremental pressure or competition on deposit, I don't think it'll
be all that meaningful for us in particular.

Hey. Good morning, John. Good morning, David. Maybe a question on capital. David, in the slides, you talked
about maintaining 10%. You're over 8% on an adjusted basis. Maybe just talk about how you think about uses of
capital outside of loan growth. I know we had some buyback this quarter. I think in December, we were talking

about the potential for a securities portfolio restructuring. Maybe just talk a little bit about how you're thinking
about incremental uses of capital from here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, obviously, let me just go through the kind of checkpoints as we think about it. So, we want to use our
capital to support loan growth. That's going to be fairly muted, as I mentioned. We want to pay a fair dividend,
35% to 45% of our earnings. So, we think that's covered. We then have excess capital that we look to put to work
in growing our business. We've looked at mortgage servicing rights, as I mentioned just a couple of calls ago, and
we'll continue to look for businesses that we think can help us grow.
We have talked about the securities repositioning. We continue to evaluate that. We have not made any decisions
to do that just yet. And outside of that, we don't want our capital to get too far away from 10%. And the 10% is
pegged on the fact that we think we're close enough with our ability to accrete capital every quarter to adapt to
whatever the regulatory environment is going to be. There's a lot of uncertainty with regards to what that's going
to look like, and there's no need for us to continue to ramp up capital to an unnecessary level and hurt our return.
We think we're in an optimal spot to be able to maneuver. And so, we think the 10% number is the right thing to
do – the right place to be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. Maybe to come at net interest income and net interest margin from a little bit of a different perspective. You
gave us guidance for the first quarter and NIM is expected to be around 3.50% for the full year. Maybe, David,
[indiscernible] (00:27:46) talk about how you see it evolving over the course of the year. And when you look out,
as we think about the declining rate cycle, where do you foresee the net interest margin settling out over time? I
know historically, we've talked about a 3.6% to 4% range. Maybe just a little bit of color on where you see it
settling out over the course of the next couple of years. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, I think you're going to see that margin pressure in the – a little bit in the first quarter and slightly in the
second quarter. The first quarter has another, call it, $3 billion of receive-fixed swaps that'll become effective,
that'll have some negative carry that hurts us a bit in the first quarter. And then, things start to change a bit
beginning in the second quarter, so literally like after the first month. So, I think you'll see a little bit more of a
movement in the first quarter and a tiny movement in the second. And then, we can start to rebound a bit where
we'll finish, we think, for the year in the 3.50% range.
I think as things settle down – we had talked about 3.60% to 4%. That 3.60% was predicated on rates really going
back down to the very low levels, and that's the – the purpose of our whole hedging strategy is because we have
lower deposit costs than most everybody, if we're going to protect our margin, we have to do it synthetically. And
so, we have about $20 billion in any given year of receive-fixed swaps and some other derivatives to help us
manage the net interest margin in the 3.60% to 4% range. So, you're likely over time to be kind of in the middle of
that, and we think that that's a possibility in time. Now, things have to settle out and we've got to get deposit costs
back to tie up with where rates are, but we can probably exit the year in the 3.60% range.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. On the operating leverage side, I mean, your guidance implies negative operating leverage,
unsurprisingly, for 2024. But as you look at your trajectory on the revenue front, your assumptions there,
combined with your expense expectations, how do you view the likelihood of achieving positive operating
leverage in 2025? And when do you expect that you could break into a more positive trajectory on a quarterly
basis? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
John, so I have a tendency to look at it on an annual basis. And you're right, we can't generate positive operating
leverage in 2024, primarily because of our outperformance in the first two quarters of 2023, where we were
having above 4% margin, which is way above most everybody. And so, I think that's been acknowledged in the
marketplace.
I do think we can get back in 2025 to generate positive operating leverage, and we'll start trending there towards
the back half of the year as we see us bottoming out in terms of net interest income and margin in the second
quarter, and then we can start to grow from there. We'll see what the economy looks like. We'll see what loan
growth looks like. We think that picks up a bit, and we think the pressure on deposit betas start to go the other
way. And as I just mentioned, we can exit with a little stronger margin. So, I think positive operating leverage
towards the back half is a possibility.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
And definitely for 2025.

And we're going to get there for 2025.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Right, right. Okay, great. That's helpful. And then secondly around credit, regarding the NPA increase, I know you
flagged the downgrades, the risk rating downgrades in some of the higher risk sectors. Maybe could you give us a
little bit more color whether – was it concentrated in any one sector? Was there a broader scrub of the loan book
that you completed that led you to the multiple of the – the multiple downgrades or is it just episodic? And then, I
guess just separately, can you just talk about the reserve? I know you're building a bit here. What's the outlook
there as you continue to add from here? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. I'd just say, John, with respect to the increase in NPLs, we've called out portfolios that have been under
some stress for a number of quarters now. And what we saw in the quarter was some migration from criticized,
classified to nonperforming, specifically in senior housing, in transportation and warehousing, transportation
specifically, and office, and then additionally manufacturing of consumer discretionary items. So, that is – and that
was our expectation.
We have one large technology credit that moved in the third quarter. That is episodic, we believe, and something
that we can and believe we will manage through. So, when you look at the migration, as we pointed out, we are
moving back to more traditional sort of historical levels of nonperforming loans, which is somewhere between 80
basis points to 100 basis points to 110 basis points. I think maybe David said the average was 102 basis points or
106 basis points – 107 basis points...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
107 basis points.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
...from 2014 (sic) [2013] (00:33:27) to 2019. And we've guided to 40 basis points to 50 basis points of charge-offs,
which we think is in line with our expectations for potential loss in the portfolio over time. So, I think we feel we
have good insight into the credits that we're managing. As to why, I would say the burden of increasing interest
rates, increasing cost, cost of labor, operating cost, all of those things have had an impact specifically on the
industries that we've historically now called out, transportation, senior housing, office, consumer discretionary.
Now, with respect to the allowance, we have a process we follow and go through every quarter. And I think we
believe that – we currently believe, obviously, that we've provided for potential losses in the portfolio over time,
unless we experienced growth in the portfolio, paydowns in the portfolio, some changes in outstandings in the
portfolio or in economic conditions. You can assume that our allowance is appropriate and likely won't change.
The trajectory of it will not change, unless the economy changes.

David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
And the only other thing, John, on that would be if the risk ratings change, then that – up or down...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
...that also impacts your provisioning or release of reserves. So, I had that point with the other two or three that
John had mentioned.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
And, David, I'm sorry, if I could just – regarding that last point, is the risk rating migration negatively assumed – is
it now assumed as part of your outlook, just given where we are in this downturn?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. That's right. You look at your reasonable and forecast period and think about where the credits are going, if
that changes though, they go the other way, that can cause you not have to provide anymore. So, we've provided
what we think we need to have. If things get better, then you don't need the reserves that you put up and you can
release those reserves. If things get worse, then you have to provide more.
Generally, loan growth is also a driver of having to add to the provision. If your loans are going the other way,
then you don't need the reserves that you had set up for them. So, you can have a release related to that.
Economic conditions got a little better in the fourth quarter than the third. So, that was a positive. But net-net,
we're continuing to look at the life of the loan and where that's going to go, and we think we have appropriate
reserves for losses that are there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
On the NII guide, I was just wondering how slide 6 might change if we don't get those cuts you're factoring in for
the year. I know you mentioned you're neutral to those. So, maybe this range wouldn't change much. Just figured
that might maybe change some of the deposit flow and beta assumptions in here and maybe some other stuff.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, we tried to put that in. If you look at the lower box, on the lower end of that, we say stable. That was
trying to address exactly what your question is.

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah, got you. And then, for the $12 billion to $14 billion in the fixed rate loan production and the securities
reinvestment you mentioned per year, I was just curious what the breakdown of that was for securities and loans,
and what yields you're putting on today on both the securities reinvestment and new loan production just on
average. I know you've got many different categories on loans you're producing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, I think in total, the kind of the front book, back book between those two is about 200 to 250 basis points
of pick-up. If you look at that $12 billion to $15 billion (sic) [$14 billion] (00:37:28), about a quarter of that's related
to securities, that going on as front book, back book pieces of, call it, 300 basis points. And loans front book, back
book are probably in the 150 to 200 basis points range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay, great. And then, just on capital, given your comments on 10% CET1 targeting that, unadjusted, what does
that mean for the pace of buybacks here? Is the fourth quarter pace a good one going forward for the next few
quarters maybe? And then, as it relates to your adjusted CET1 ratio, which is just over 8% you've got here, how
are you thinking about where you want that to be over time as the new rates kick in?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, one, we don't know what the new rules are going to be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
True.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
So, we fully loaded it with 8.2% to say – to show you that that doesn't impact our stress capital buffer or our
absolute minimum. We're in good shape there. We just need to see where the rules come out. And by the time all
that happens, AOCI is going to be in a different spot than it is today, assuming rates continue to come down a bit.
We saw a pretty big move in all of the peers with AOCI this quarter. From a capital standpoint, we think 10% is
the right number. What was the...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dana W. Nolan A
Executive Vice President & Head-Investor Relations, Regions Financial Corp.
The buyback pace.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
The buyback pace. So, again, we use the buy back as our last mechanism to help us keep our common equity
Tier 1 in that 10% range. And so, the pace is, do your favorite earnings expectation, take out the dividend, use a
bit of that with a low single-digit loan growth, and then the rest is either going to be buying mortgage servicing

rights or things of that nature. And then, we toggle with share repurchases. So, I don't want to comment on
whether we stay on the pace because I end up getting you the earnings guidance. That's a trick.

question.

Good morning, Gerard.

Hi, Gerard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi, John, and hi, David. David, can you share with us – you guys have given us good detail on credit quality. And
John, you pointed out that the nonperforming loan increase was to the sectors of your portfolio that you've already
identified as being weak. Could we look at it another way? And you give us good details on slides 27 and 28 on
the leveraged portfolio and the Shared National Credit portfolio. How are those portfolios holding up credit-wise?
And when you think back to where we were a year ago, I remember in many of the calls, the word recession was
used quite often in those calls. We're not hearing that on this fourth quarter earnings call from most – or nearly all
the banks. So, have these portfolios held up better than what you would have thought from a year ago?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
I would say yes, Gerard. The leveraged portfolio is largely relationship-based credit business. Those are banking
relationships that we enjoy. We're close to those customers and we've been close to them throughout this period
of elevated rates. There was some risk as rates rose that we had that there may be some softness in the portfolio,

but I think it's performed well. The same is true of our Shared National Credit book. As we began to build the
capital markets business to help us grow and diversify our revenue and to meet more customer needs, we
naturally then began to expand the size of our Shared National Credit book, so that we could serve those
customers that had need for those products and services.
And with that, as you can imagine, comes some tall tree risk, single-name risk. And while I mentioned earlier, we
have a technology credit that's fairly substantial that's an NPL, that is an example of a Shared National Credit
exposure that we have good visibility into. We think it has very limited risk of loss, but still is a nonperforming loan.
But overall, I would say just based upon the reflection on the performance of that book, it's been good. We've
enjoyed expanding relationships, growing revenue from capital markets and/or deposits, treasury management
that we enjoy with those customers. And so, I think we've been pleased with the performance of both the
leveraged book and the Shared National Credit book.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then, coming back to loans, and I think, David, in your comments, you talked about loan demand
remains soft and you're looking for low single-digit growth for average loans in 2024. I know, during our careers,
the shadow banking industry has continued its competition against the banks. But it seems today, there's more
coverage of the private equity side getting into lending, maybe greater than we've seen in years. How are you
guys competing against the private credit markets? And at the same time, are any of those private credit lenders
customers of yours that you have to balance that relationship of a customer competing against you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
We have a very modest exposure to private equity, who then is – we're not lending to private equity to in turn lend
into our customer base. So, if we have any exposure, it would be very modest there. Separately, we don't see
private equity as a competitor necessarily within our core middle market customer base. I asked Ronnie Smith the
question the other day, if he could name a customer that we lost to private credit, and we can't think of one.
Now, it doesn't mean it's not occurring in some of the markets that we're in. But by and large, given our focus on
the core middle market business and investment grade type Shared National Credit exposure, we're just not –
we're not seeing private credit as a competitor today on the wholesale side. Now, there are lots of competitors on
the Consumer side that we're seeing in a variety of different ways, including mortgage and home improvement
that we compete with.

Hey. Good morning. So, appreciate the guidance on expenses and expense control there. But I did have a
question on – just an update on the technology modernization project and kind of what you're baking in for
expenses in 2024, and if part of that other expense savings is related to maybe delaying some of that project until
further use.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Brandon, so we've given you our overall expense guide to be essentially flat after you carve out operational
losses from the past year. We continue to make investments in our business. We called it R2, which is our
transformation project in cyber and risk management, consumer compliance, a lot of investment in areas of the

bank that we're looking to offset elsewhere. Our R2 project is coming along very well. We spend anywhere,
depending on the year, 9% to 11% of our revenue in terms of technology cost. We don't expect that to change
materially in the short term.
We continue to evaluate how we can better leverage technology, and I think we have a lot of upside potential to
leverage that in our business to continue to improve and to continue to take out manual steps, manual processes
and have a technology solution, too. So, we think our investment in technology is the right thing to do, and we're
going to have a modern core deposit platform in the not-too-distant future, which we think will be a competitive
advantage for us as well. So, anyway, that's kind of the spending range, if you will, 9% to 11% for revenue.

Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay, okay. And then, I just had a follow-up on credit and particularly in senior housing. Just wanted to get more
details as far as your exposure there. What are you thinking as far as ultimate loss content and any protections
from a credit loss perspective?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. We're seeing improvement in the senior housing space, notwithstanding the fact that we have a couple of
credits we're carrying as nonperforming. Generally, occupancy rates are improving over time. Today, we've got
about $63 million in – I'm sorry, $57 million in – $118 million in nonperforming loans and reserves against those
credits of about 3.7%. So, I think we maybe provided information on slide 20 in your deck. But we are seeing
improvement in senior housing as occupancy rates pick up and people become a little more comfortable with
communal living again amongst that age group.

Hello, Erika.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. One follow-up question, Dave. I think very notable what you said to Ryan's line of questioning, the
3.6% exit rate for the net interest margin in the fourth quarter. A lot of investors are now focused on that exit rate.
So, I'm just wondering if I could ask you sort of what the component pieces is – or are rather. So, unless you've
changed anything on the – in terms of adding swaps, it seems like you do have $1.6 billion of notional rolling off in
the fourth quarter. So, I guess it's a good guy.
You also mentioned a terminated swap gain in your 10-Q, but you had like a forward look for four quarters.
Wondering what that could be for 4Q 2024. And then, more notably, obviously, you guys have said unequivocally
that it's the deposit assumptions that's really going to make a difference. I'm wondering sort of what the speed is
that you're assuming on that 35% down beta, especially if you think that the first rate cut, I think, you said it was in
May.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, I think all-in, the big drivers that are controlling the deposit costs, we do have a headwind of the $3
billion notional forward starting swap in the first quarter, and then we're kind of in the run rate. The terminated
swaps are in the amortization already. Those aren't the huge drivers. I think after we get our headwind and if rates
start to come down, then like I said, almost 60% of our beta is associated with indexed deposits on the
commercial side. So, they'll start to come down. And you start then having the loan and security repricing, the
fixed maturity repricing, adding 200 basis points, 250 basis points, that overwhelms that headwind towards the
back end of the year and you get a little bit of loan growth in the back end. All that helps you propel you to a much
stronger fourth quarter finish than you have at the beginning of the year.
So, I think if you really looked at what is the one big thing that you have to get done, and it's controlling the
deposit costs, and we do that through managing the beta as rates change, like I said, 55%, 60% of it indexed. The
other is decisioning we have to make, and that gets a – be a little herky-jerky, because as I mentioned, some of
that's money market that we can change pretty quickly. The other is CDs that were locked in today, it's seven
months. And as things renew this month, next month and going forward, we're looking to be shorter rather than
longer, so that we are prepared to take advantage to reduce our deposit costs as rates come down.

And a follow-up to that, you mentioned 55% to 60% of that down beta will be coming from these indexed
commercial deposits. One of your peers made a differentiation between indexed and contractual yesterday. And I
guess just give us some sense of how much of that is contractual versus indexed, and – but really it sounds like
you're confident that either way, you can control that to the downside, especially if, as you said, loan growth
remains soft this year.

Yeah. So, when we say indexed, we're talking about it's tied to Fed funds. When Fed funds changes through the
contract, it changes automatically. There's no – there's not a contractual number locked in like effectively a CD.
It's the day – just like a loan that's based on SOFR. I mean, SOFR changes, so does the loan rate that day. And
so, that's what we're talking about when we say indexed deposits.

Good morning, Matt.

Matt O'Connor Q

Good morning. Any updated thoughts on potential regulatory changes to the debit card interchange rate or
overdraft fees and thinking about potential [indiscernible] (00:52:39) to that?

David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, the – so, debit interchange is going through a discussion to adjust that down, as was written in the original
law. They had to revisit the cost associated with debit interchange. To the extent that does get put into place,
that'll have a negative impact to us starting – I think that was going to be kicking in in June. So, it's about a half a
year. And based on our numbers, that's about a $45 million risk item to us in our NIR. Relative to the overdrafts,
we're a long way from knowing where that comes out, if there are any changes, and I think that's a...

David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
That just hit the wire. I think there's going to be a lot of discussion on that, because we're disappointed in that. We
think provision of liquidity to our customer base is really, really important. We do charge a fee for that, but we're
paying an item for somebody and charging a fee. And to the extent we return that item to where it was written, our
view is that entity is going to charge a fee. And so, it's not helpful to not be able to provide liquidity to our
customer base. And so, we're hoping there's going to be further discussion on that point, and I think it'd be
premature to really talk about the impact to OD until we get further down the road.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then separately, good to see the elevated check fraud came down as you expected, and the outlook
kind of implies that you're confident that you're past these issues. I guess I just want to reconfirm that, and then
also just any meaningful changes that you made to address it and whether it showed up in expenses as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
I would just say that the countermeasures that we've put in place, which include talent, technology, process
changes, all have been effective. And we believe going forward, the run rate will be $20 million to $25 million a
quarter in operating losses. And the expenses associated with those countermeasures are embedded in our run
rate and in our projection for expenses for 2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. We got to continue to be vigilant with regards to this, just like we are with cyber. So, we have bad people
attacking us, as does every financial institution, and we have to continue to stay ahead of it. We feel good about
what we've put in place, but we are not sitting idle. We're continuing to push and challenge ourselves to get even
better than we are today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay, perfect. That's helpful. Thank you.

John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Thank you. Okay. Operator, is that the end of the calls?

Operator: Yes. I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.
