Thank you, operator. We appreciate everyone joining us to review Ally Financial's first quarter 2020 results this
morning. You can find the presentation that we'll reference throughout the call on the Investor Relations section of

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2020
This morning, we have our CEO, Jeff Brown; and our CFO, Jenn LaClair on the call to review our results and take
your questions following prepared remarks.
With that, I'll turn the call over to JB.

Jeffrey Jonathan Brown
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Daniel. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining the call during this critical time for our
nation.
The past several weeks have presented significant challenges for many around the world due to COVID-19. I'd
like to take this opportunity to thank countless individuals who are battling on the front lines including first
responders, healthcare workers, grocers, delivery and supply chain providers and many others, you represent the
best of who we are, thank you. We also hope all of you and your families and teammates remain safe and in good
health.
In response to the virus, over 90% of the US economy has been impacted. Individuals in 41 states are currently
under stay-at-home orders, resulting in a near shutdown of economic activity across many sectors. At the peak,
23 states had either closed or restricted dealer sales. Essentially all states have been fixed service operations or
service as a central business, but sales have been obviously meaningfully impacted.
These 23 states represented about 50% of our origination volume last year. This morning we will review Ally's
response to ongoing developments and provide you with perspectives on, number one, what we're seeing across
our businesses. Number two, how we are positioned to successfully navigate the rapidly evolving environment.
And third, a firm that our focus remains unchanged on delivering for our customers and driving long term value.
Over the past several years the strong foundation we built has allowed our company to thrive during economic
expansion and positions us now to be a source of strength for all of our key constituents during this difficult time
and when we begin to recover. Remaining disciplined in our customer focus and true to our values will allow us to
emerge from this period stronger than before, resuming the trajectory of both financial and operational
improvements we've delivered the past several years.
On slide number 4, we've outlined the decisive and timely actions taken on behalf of our employees, customers
and communities. I'm exceptionally proud and humble to stand alongside 8,700 teammates witnessing firsthand
how our values have been demonstrated with actions and efforts across our company every single day. Our
number one priority remains the well-being of our people and we executed several rapid actions in this regard.
Cross-functional teams acted swiftly in mid-March, enabling 99% of our employees to work from home in a matter
of days.
We quickly expanded our benefits in late March with the emphasis on health and family care and provided a
$1,200 financial assistance payment for employees who make under $100,000. For our customers, we were
proud to lead the industry and rolling out comprehensive relief, bringing increased financial flexibility and added
security during an uncertain time for many. Jenn will walk through the details in a few moments, but the overall
participation rates, sentiment scores and NPS levels reinforce for us that our customers recognize our efforts to
do it right.
Our commitment to them in this environment will ultimately strengthen relationships and mitigate losses down the
line. We were not mandated to take these actions, but there is no playbook to navigate an environment like we

face. This is a time when your values serve as your guiding principles. For our dealers, we were proud to offer
payment relief and launch an SBA offering under the Payroll Protection Plan Program. In a matter of a few days,
we stood up a capability that allowed us to submit nearly 1,000 applications on behalf of our dealer customers. At
Ally Bank, our direct digital platform that has generated 10 consecutive years of customer expansion and deposit
growth saw record mobile app downloads during March. Remaining true to our brand, we waived a variety of
charges across our deposit and invest offerings until July of this year. This includes deposit overdraft fees and
payment deferral options in our mortgage product, which we've never been reliant on overly burdensome
customer fees.
We're energized by the overwhelmingly positive responses we received from customers via social platforms, call
centers and direct communications to myself and hundreds of our teammates. For our communities, we recognize
this is a moment in society where the private sector has to play a role. And companies like Ally need to step up
and do more. We've jumped at the opportunity to increase our giving, kludging $3 million in financial aid to 30
deserving charities focused on housing, health, education, food and economic development. Across each of these
areas, our actions continue to be guided by our customer-centric philosophy in Do It Right approach.
I'll briefly review results for the quarter on slide number 5. Similar to the past few years, 2020 began with strong
financial and operating trajectories while building momentum and ongoing improvement across key metrics. While
we don't know how long the shutdown will last or what the specific impacts will be on broad base economic
activities, we are confident Ally is well-positioned to navigate the cycle, supporting our customers, enhancing
loyalty and driving incremental growth opportunities in the long-term.
Financial results for the first quarter reflects higher provision for credit losses, including a reserve increase of over
2.5 times the prior quarter level, reflecting CECL Day 1 and anticipating COVID-19 impacts. Adjusted EPS was
negative $0.44 and core ROTCE was negative 5.4%. Total revenue exceeded $1.6 billion for the third
consecutive quarter, a 5% increase year-over-year. In auto, we originated $9.1 billion of loans and leases during
the quarter, while decisioning 3 million applications. Through January and February application volume was 5%
higher compared to 2019, but declined 6% for the quarter, reflecting a meaningful slowdown in March activity.
New originated auto yields were 7.25% during the quarter, NCOs increased year-over-year to 1.45% with minimal
impact from COVID-19 in the quarter. We are continually assessing market dynamics and competitive behaviors
while maintaining disciplined underwriting standards, while also remaining focused on potential opportunities to
further support our customers. Within insurance, we underwrote $317 million of premiums, representing our
highest first quarter result and demonstrating the meaningful progress we've made expanding our reach.
Turning to deposits, we ended the quarter with over $122 billion in balances, an increase of $9 billion year-over-
year through strong net growth every month during the quarter. We added 71,000 new deposit customers in the
quarter, driving us to over $2 million total depositors. The steady balance growth and consistent customer trends
demonstrate the resilience of our platform, the stability in our funding profile and the intrinsic value of our brand,
all critically important as we head into a challenging economy.
This should also provide clear illustration of the robust funding machine that exists at our company. Many others
in our industries don't have the robust liquidity posture that exists at Ally. This is a dramatic improvement of our
company relative to the crisis in 2008 and 2009. Within our consumer and commercial product lines, Ally Home
and Ally Invest observed [Technical Difficulty] (00:09:00) Ally Home direct-to-consumer originations of $700
million, reflected ongoing awareness of our offering as the environment drove a strong refinance pipeline for 2Q.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2020
Invest accounts grew at the highest and fastest pace in over four years under the Ally brand. And having this
capability served as a customer and balance retention tool for Ally, we captured nearly $700 million of balance
transfers from our deposit platform that could have otherwise ended up outside of Ally. Ally Lending volume was
$70 million in the quarter, increasing 5% quarter-over-quarter. And corporate finance balances grew primarily as a
result of increased line draw activity. In early April we've seen a significant slowdown in additional line draws.
From a capital perspective, we proactively suspended share buybacks through the end of the second quarter
given the events unfolding in the macro environment and we submitted our capital plan as part of the CCAR 2020
cycle in early April. Regarding the CardWorks acquisition, we began our integration work and filed for regulatory
approval on schedule. We continue to remain in dialogue with Don and the team on operational and business
trends. While we obviously did not anticipate the rapid economic changes when we announced the deal two
months ago, the long-term benefits of the acquisition remain unchanged. I know certain provisions of the deal are
on your minds and it is hard to say much at this time.
What we can continue to promise is that we will make the right decisions for our customers and shareholders for
the long run. CardWorks' long-term track record will serve as an important differentiator in this environment. As
we shared when we announced the deal, CardWorks had successfully navigated many cycles across its 32-year
history and thrive following the last cycle. We recognize this environment is a different animal, but we know the
quality of this business and these operators.
On slide number 6 are the key metrics we've highlighted for several years that we believe provide important short-
term and long-term context across Ally's performance and inherent value. While the EPS result in the upper left is
not something we're satisfied with, this reflects actions we're taking to build reserves and to position for expected
losses related to COVID-19. This short-term metric should be looked at in conjunction with tangible book value
trends shown in the bottom right to gain a broader perspective of the inherent franchise value and long-term
trends. We've grown book value year-over-year to $32.80, even as capital levels remained steady, reserves
increased 2.5 times since yearend through CECL implementation and absorbing the resulting net loss in Q1.
We've included CECL's Day 1 pro-forma impact as added context.
Revenues in the upper right remained strong this quarter, in many aspects of our embedded balance sheet
positioning remain intact. Deposits on the bottom left increased at over $122 billion and now represents 75% of
our funding base. As I mentioned a few moments ago, we are well positioned to execute in the uncertain
environment and believe we'll be rewarded by our customers over the long-term. Our management team is more
focused than ever on the risks in front of us while actively looking for new opportunities to innovate for our
customers and build upon our momentum.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jenn to take you through the detailed financial results.

Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thank you JB, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by echoing the deep gratitude for those working on
the frontlines to serve and protect us during this critical time. I'd also like to recognize our employees, who have
shown strong dedication and resolve over the past six weeks, rising to the occasion both personally and
professionally on behalf of our company, customers, and communities. I'm proud of our people and proud to be
part of the team.
With that, let's start then on slide 7. As you're aware, there are many unknowns in our current environment,
including the length of the shutdown, unemployment levels, GDP deterioration and consumer and business

confidence. Ally along with many others is challenged to accurately project the impacts on many key aspects of
our business. Despite this and in the spirit of providing transparency, we've laid out a variety of insights into what
we're currently experiencing and expecting as we move forward this year. These insights are based on what we
know today and we recognize and expect many variables will continue to evolve.
As JB alluded to, January and February results were strong and continue to demonstrate growing momentum.
Beginning mid-March, the economic shutdown was immediately felt across our business lines, resulting in
declines across several areas, but also increases in our digital channels, including Ally Home and Ally Invest. In
auto, reduced activity at dealerships lowered app volume and originations by over 50% by late March which we
would expect to continue in line with the shelter-in-place orders.
Over time as the economy improves, we'll be positioned to act swiftly on opportunities, including a potential
increase in demand for used, prudently stepping in where others may have exited, providing adaptable solutions
as we did with the expanded Carvana floor program and the SBA product launch for our dealers where we've
funded virtually 100% of our applications prior to the program shutdown last Thursday.
In deposits, customer growth and retention remained strong and we expect that to continue throughout 2020. We
have the second highest customer growth for our first quarter and retention rates remained at 96%. In addition to
the growing preference for digital, Ally continues to gain momentum with brand recognition at all-time highs. We
also grew in spite of increased transfers to brokers, reflecting equity market volatility, but captured nearly 30% of
the outflows at Invest.
We remain balanced in our deposit pricing decisions throughout 2020 as we're mindful of market rates, competitor
actions and alternative funding opportunities. Ally Home saw elevated volume in March and early April due to
refinance demand. We expect the shelter-in-place provisions will reduce demand for purchase volumes which
have already started to decline in various areas of the country.
Managing credit risk remains a top priority for us and we know you're focused on this topic as well. While we are
not yet seeing deteriorating impact on our credit performance, we've already adjusted our servicing strategies real
time, including the rollout of augmented staffing capacity, increased customer outreach and enhanced digital
engagement. Our reserve levels are over 2.5 times the level they were at year-end, reflecting life-of-loss CECL
implementation and a deteriorating macroeconomic forecast, including elevated unemployment approaching 10%
and significant GDP decline. We run a variety of economic scenarios on a regular basis to inform decisions and to
ensure we have line of sight into various outcomes.
We implemented CECL as scheduled this quarter which as we discussed in Q4 reflects a 12 month reasonable
and supportable forecast period and include the 2008, 2009 macroeconomic data in our historic mean. I'll cover
more on our reserves momentarily.
We expect retail NCOs at 1.8% to 2.1% this year reflecting our current macroeconomic assumptions with the
ultimate outcome dependent on how the environment unfold. As a reference, our CCAR modeling implies retail
NCOs rise to 2.5% to 3%, reflecting a persistent broad-based macroeconomic deterioration. The stimulus checks
are likely to have a positive impact of credit performance as polling has shown the number one expected use of
additional funds is to pay down debt or bills. Within our reserves, we have not embedded any stimulus benefit at
this time.
Moving to the bottom section, we remain in constructive dialogue with our regulators keeping them apprised of
trends we're seeing. The fiscal and monetary actions taken by Congress and the Fed are providing critical cash

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2020
for Americans and necessary liquidity for the broader markets. Ally does not have any outstanding discount
window draws, however we believe this is an efficient and rational mechanism for banks to access liquidity. We
applaud the regulatory community for broad and sweeping actions taken to support the US economy. And as you
are aware, we withdrew our 2020 financial outlook earlier this month.
While we are experiencing near-term earnings headwinds, as JB touched on a moment ago, the current
environment will not impact our long-term strategies and value. Our balance sheet remains strong with sufficient
capital, funding and liquidity, which I'll cover more on in a moment. For 2020 broadly, we expect revenue trends to
reflect the rate environment and moderating originations due to the shutdown. As we discussed, credit charges
and reserve levels are based on what we know today, which we will continue to monitor and adjust as conditions
unfold. On expenses, while we continue to invest in areas that will enhance our company over the long-term, we
are active in identifying and reducing discretionary spend across the company.
The next two slides provide additional context around how we are positioned heading into this downturn. So let's
turn to slide 8, the multiyear transformation of our funding profile and improved liquidity position are evidenced
through these charts. Wholesale funding has been replaced by deposits, providing increased stability and lower
funding costs. These trends will continue although we will opportunistically access wholesale markets from time to
time as we did in early April with our first unsecured issuance as an investment-grade company. Our liquidity
position highlights Ally's ability to withstand adverse changes in the broader environment and demonstrate
significant growth and liquidity over the past several years. Over 80% of our available-for-sale portfolio is in highly
liquid securities, ensuring we have significant flexibility and we continue to have access to unused capacity at the
FHLB.
Turning to slide 9, our CET1 levels have remained consistent and above our 9% target over the last several years
as we've efficiently deployed capital through balance sheet expansion and direct shareholder distribution. For
context, we remain substantially above our minimum capital levels and modeled CCAR scenarios, incorporating
stress assumptions and ongoing dividend payments. While we're not inferring events to unfold exactly as prior
stress scenarios imply, this provides insight into our capital preparedness and ability to withstand a severe
prolonged downturn, allowance for loan losses grew to $3.2 billion or 2.54% of loan balances, representing the
highest loss absorption capacity in the history of our company as we head into a downturn. We have built a strong
foundation which will ensure Ally stands ready to support our customers through all of our banking products.
On slide 10, we'll walk through our first quarter financial results. Net financing revenue excluding OID of $1.154
billion declined linked quarter $10 million and increased year-over-year by $16 million. The decline versus prior
quarter was primarily driven by non-recurring revenue retiming items related to the conversion of our retail auto
servicing system. As you would expect, when converting a large asset base to a new system, there were some
minor timing differences in certain calculations, but these variances will neutralize over the life of the asset.
Excluding this item, underlying trends continue this quarter where auto portfolio yields increased, while deposit
costs declined.
Adjusted other revenue of $451 million remained elevated this quarter, reflecting strong investment gains and
expanded mortgage fee income. Provision expense of $903 million reflected reserve build activity related to
COVID-19. Non-interest expense increased by $40 million linked quarter and $90 million compared to the prior
year. Increases versus prior quarter were largely due to compensation seasonality and certain COVID-19 related
employee benefits.
Compared to prior year, drivers included items that should be familiar to you, including volume and revenue
based activities, reflecting our growing customer base and insurance related expenses commensurate with

written premium growth, investments in our brands and techs capabilities and expenses from our expanded
consumer products, including Ally Lending on-boarded late last year. As I discussed earlier, we expect to continue
prudently investing in our company, but expenses will grow at a slower pace as we reduce discretionary spend
given the material change in our operating environment. The metrics at the bottom reflect impacts of our large
reserve build during this quarter.
Let's turn to slide 11. From an industry perspective, benchmark rates this quarter touched all-time lows across
many tenors, including a 150 basis point reduction by the Federal Reserve to support the broader economy. The
combination of these events has resulted in a persistently flat forward curve. To reduce earnings volatility, we've
managed to a relatively neutral interest rate position for some time, including our NIM relative to more asset
sensitive balance sheet. However, the flat shape of the curve will weigh on margin expansion.
Turning to the quarter, net interest margin excluding OID was relatively stable at 2.68%. This included a 5 basis
point reduction to consolidated NIM and an 11 basis point reduction to retail auto yield, due to the system
conversion I just mentioned. Year-over-year average earning assets remained stable at $173 billion, as we
expanded across every line item, except commercial auto, where inventory levels were 8% lower year-over-year.
Notably this trend reversed in late March due to lower sales, where industry days supply jumped by 25 days to 95
days overall. We are observing downward trends in April, which is likely to continue as OEM production resumes.
Looking closer at some of the line items. Retail auto balances will be dependent on originated volume, while
portfolio yields will continue expanding this year. Lease yields will be heavily dependent on auction lands
reopening and consumer demand returning, while used car value declines in the near term are primarily due to
lower auction levels, we believe the more relevant pricing trends will not be available until auction activities
resume it's normal level.
Commercial auto balances will reflect dynamics discussed a moment ago, while lower benchmarks will drive
lower yields, nearly 60% of our corporate financing book has LIBOR floors, which are expected to mitigate the
impact of lower market rate. Mortgage balances will grow in Q2, reflecting strong refinance volumes given
historically low mortgage rates.
Turning to liabilities. Cost of funds continue to improve this quarter, down 12 basis points linked-quarter and 27
basis points year-over-year. These trends are fueled by deposits which we cover on the next slide. Deposit
expansion continued this quarter ending at $122.3 billion. Retail deposits grew by $2.3 billion despite record
outflows to brokerages that exceeded full year 2019 level. We retained a third of these outflows at Invest,
testament to the retention value of the platform. Other than that in addition to capturing outflows and experiencing
record self-directed trading activity, we garnered several industry awards and leading reviews.
We also launched a suite of deposit savings tools for our customers, designed to increase customers' ability to
plan, allocate and grow their savings. In the bottom left, retail deposit rates declined 14 basis points linked-quarter
and have fallen 26 basis points year-over-year. Competitive dynamics reflect the uncertain outlook on consumers,
but we are well positioned to remain thoughtful and disciplined around pricing and growth. We added 71,000
customers surpassing the 2 million mark this quarter, an important milestone for us and our industry leading
customer retention levels remained at 96%.
Let's turn to capital and shareholder distributions on slide 13. CET1 was 9.3% in Q1 in line with our recent trends.
We elected to defer capital related impacts associated with CECL for two years per guidance provided by the
Federal Reserve. We repurchased 3.8 million shares before suspending the repurchase program through the end
of the second quarter.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2020
Last week, our board of directors approved an Q2 dividend of $0.19 per share payable on May 15. We completed
our CCAR 2020 process during the quarter and submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve in early April.
We remain in regular dialogue with the Fed, navigating the potential implications with the CardWorks acquisition
on our capital plan, including implementation of the SCB final rule, effective October 1, 2020.
Asset quality details are on slide 14. Consolidated net charge-off of 84 basis points this quarter increased 11
basis points year-over-year, reflecting retail auto activity. In the upper right, net charge off of $266 million
increased $29 million compared to the prior year, driven by increasing auto loan balances and ongoing seasoning
of the portfolio, including a higher used mix. In the bottom left, retail auto net charge-offs were up 12 basis points
year-over-year in line with our expectations. While we expect the deteriorating environment to drive this metric
higher moving forward, COVID-19 impacts were immaterial in Q1.
Looking at delinquency trends in the bottom right, 60-plus increased 18 basis points year-over-year and 30-plus
increased 63% basis points over the same period. In the far right, we've highlighted the balance impact of the
customers participating in the payment deferral program. These populations fall under unique accounting
treatment, where participating customers are effectively present in their status for the duration of the deferral. This
unique population resulted in increased reported delinquencies year-over-year as these accounts do not follow
the normal flow-to-better, and flow-to-loss trends. These dynamics will also impact reported net charge-off rates in
future periods.
While we know this will make it difficult to rely on these metrics as we have in the past, two key points to keep in
mind. First, our allowance levels contemplate consumers' willingness and ability to pay, regardless of forbearance
participation. And second, we believe these programs will help mitigate future losses across our portfolio, and
within our securitizations as we work to find solutions to keep our customers paying for and in their cars.
Slide 15 provides additional detail on reserve levels and CECL. On the top half of the page, we've highlighted the
significant increase in reserves and coverage levels resulting from CECL implementations and the forecasted
macroeconomic deterioration related to COVID-19. The consolidated trends are driven primarily by increases in
the retail order book with coverage of 3.91%. Overall reserve balances shown on the bottom reflect similar
drivers.
Moving to slide 16, we've provided a summary of the deferral program for retail auto customers. Over 1.1 million
auto customers elected to participate in our deferral program as of April 16. The vast majority of this population
where 76% have never had an extension, while 70% have never been delinquent with Ally. We believe
participation in this program will lower loss content due to the additional time and flexibility we are providing to our
customers.
In addition, we are increasing our customer servicing support, employing use of additional techniques and
readiness tools to maintain line of sight into their ability to pay and to provide a seamless transition to resuming
payments at the end of the program. We will be able to track leading indicators of default and intervene early with
loss mitigating actions to help keep our customers on track with their payments. We are encouraged by the
positive customer responses and believe our approach reinforces our values during this time of uncertainty and
keeps Ally top of mind.
On slide 17, we've included detailed auto financial results for the quarter. Much of this has been covered through
prior content, but I will highlight a few additional items. Net financing revenue grew year-over-year even as
commercial balances declined driving end-of-period earning asset levels lower overall. In the bottom right,

estimated retail new origination yields remained well above 7% for the eighth consecutive quarters. This will drive
the portfolio yield higher throughout 2020. Beyond our retail relief program, we are offering lease flexibility and
meaningful support for dealers to support their businesses 72% of dealers are using some form of relief we've
offered. Additionally in the Paycheck Protection Program offering we rolled out, we funded essentially all
applicants, representing over $850 million in loans secured.
Turning to auto metrics on slide 18. Q1 originations of $9.1 billion quarter-over-quarter, average FICO remain
steady at 686 while nonprime volume declined slightly to 11%. Moving to the bottom left consumer assets grew
year-over-year to $81.5 billion across the loan and lease categories. And looking at commercial assets on the
bottom right, average balances declined $5.1 billion compared to the prior year reflecting lower dealer inventory
levels.
Insurance segment results on slide 19. Core pre-tax income of $77 million in Q1 was down $9 million linked-
quarter and $3 million year-over-year primarily driven by higher losses, including weather related expenses.
Underwriting income excluding losses was essentially flat year-over-year as increased VSC and GAAP revenue
was offset by the impact of lower floorplan inventory levels. Written premiums of $317 million grew $12 million
year-over-year and represented our strongest first quarter level.
Slide 20 has our corporate finance segment results. Core pre-tax loss of $64 million was driven by $114 million of
reserve build during the quarter primarily related to the estimated potential impact of COVID-19. Pending assets
grew $785 million during the quarter and $1.6 billion year-over-year, which included $600 million of elevated
draws on revolving lines of credit, as borrowers thought to boost liquidity. Draw activity moderated significantly in
late March and into April.
We have been working directly with our individual borrowers most of which will be impacted in some manner in
the coming months. We believe the portfolio remained strong considering 45% of the book is asset-based, the
strong positioning of our loans and the capital structure, the significant equity investments of our supporting
sponsors and the solid business value proposition of our borrowers, lastly we have no direct oil and gas exposure
in our book.
On slide 21 mortgage pre-tax income of $12 million this quarter increased $10 million versus prior quarter and
was essentially flat year-over-year. Elevated prepayments drove asset levels down and resulted in higher
premium amortization expense. Origination volume was strong as Ally leveraged its existing customer base and
leading digital capabilities through our partnership with Better.com.
I'll close by reiterating my support of our Ally teammates who are the driving force behind the strength of our
company. I recognize this is a difficult time for many, but I'm confident we will navigate and succeed together. We
will continue positioning the company for the future focusing on Doing It Right for our customers and communities
and delivering long-term value for our shareholders.
And with that, I'll turn it back to JB.

Thank you, Jenn. On slide number 22, I have included perspectives on the environment we're operating in today
and how Ally will steer through the uncertainty. The sudden and severe nature of this shutdown has affected the
world and our nation in a manner that is arguably never been replicated on a scale of this magnitude. It is within
this context that I think it's important to acknowledge that significant action across public and private sectors is

necessary and should continue on a size and scale that has not been seen in modern history to directly address
the outbreak that is already having negative impacts on workers, consumers and citizens across America.
While some positive trends are emerging in regard to the spread of the virus, we still do not know how long it will
take to return to a state of normalcy. At Ally, you've heard throughout our remarks this morning, and as long as I
have been in the chair, we are relentlessly focused on our customers. We've built a strong and vibrant culture
around this mantra and today, we're even more emboldened to act in accordance with these principles. This
provides clarity for our customers and purpose for our teammates in a time of great uncertainty and we're
confident, it will ultimately drive long-term shareholder value.
We entered the current environment with a strong, well-positioned balance sheet with funding, capital and liquidity
position to serve as sources of strength. We've grown our auto and deposit offerings into dominant, adaptable
franchises, ready to continue delivering for our customers while actively seeking new opportunities to expand. The
headwinds we will experience in the near-term while admittedly challenging will not impact our ability to deliver on
our long-term strategies and visions.
I'll wrap up on slide number 23. We take great pride in being a comprehensive, adaptive and digitally-focused
consumer and commercial finance provider. We are focused on leveraging expertise and our history to build a
stronger company for the future, including disciplined risk management and purposeful capital management.
Thank you to our associates, I am proud of your ability to rise to the occasion, Doing It Right in every interaction
with our customers within our communities and on behalf of our shareholders. And with that, Daniel back to you,
and I think we're going to take some brief Q&A.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2020
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.
Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe A. Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks. I'm hoping that you could kind of expand a little bit on the process. I know you talked about the
assumed loss rate. You said that you've got a very significant percentage of your customers that are in deferral,
but you also said that you weren't relying on the stimulus. So, could you kind of talk to us about how those
customers actually go through the process and what we should be looking to see that would help validate the
assumptions that you made?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Sure. Good morning, Moshe. Yeah. Sure. Let me just jump in on our reserve process, and how it relates to our
deferral population. So, as we went through the reserving this quarter we have essentially modeled it per our
macroeconomic forecast and looked at historic relations and willingness and ability to pay for our overall customer
base. We have not at this time included any of what we think will be a net positive benefit from the forbearance
programs that we've rolled out to our populations or even the stimulus impact that our customers are likely to
benefit from. So, we kept the processes separate. We think in that way that our reserves are fairly balanced and
we'll continue to very closely monitor that population in the forbearance program, we're going to do that through
quantitative means as well as through qualitative measures as we're increasing both human and digital outreach
to those customers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe A. Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Okay. And maybe as a follow-up, could you talk a little bit about the outlook for deposit pricing obviously your
growth in deposits has been strong and you're likely to see now that the wave of drawdowns on corporate finance
lines has crested that probably you're going to see [ph] bound (00:37:21) asset levels falling. So could you talk a
little bit about deposit pricing as we go into Q2 and back half of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Sure, Moshe. I mean the bottom-line here is we do see opportunity to continue to look at deposit pricing
and bring it down over time, especially when you look at where rates are today. Now we're taking a very balanced
approach. We want to make sure that we emerge from this crisis in a position of strength and we're positioned to
grow our balance sheet appropriately with funding available. And once you turn the machine off, it can be harder
to turn it back on. But if you just look at kind of the trends that we're seeing on our balance sheet, we are
expecting asset levels to come down a bit. Our loan-to-deposit ratios are approaching 100%. And we continue to
see just based on our funding needs as well as where rates are that there will be opportunity to take down pricing.
And as we always do we'll be thoughtful around managing customer value, competitive rates and our funding
needs on the balance sheet.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the call this morning. Two questions; I'll start with one just on the forbearance. You
gave a lot of numbers around the forbearance impact on the DQs. Could you just remind us the forbearance
percentages of outstanding balances that you've been getting requests for on both the consumer side as well as
on the corporate side, the dealer side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Sure. Good morning, Betsy. So, if you look at our forbearance population starting first within retail at 1.1
million customers, it's about 25% of our accounts, a little bit higher than that, in terms of the balances. Keep in
mind with this population we were very proactive and you see across the industry a number of re-active offers, we
were proactive, we actually went out and emailed our customers and offered them the opportunity to have more
payment flexibility. So we do think that this position us from a brand and loyalty perspective and Doing It Right
approach positions us incredibly strongly.
On the commercial side, we have about 73% or so of our dealerships that are taking advantage of payment
deferral, that's one of the programs we've provided. We are also offering them the PPP program through the SBA.
If you think about a couple of weeks ago we weren't even an SBA lender, we were able to process 1,000
applications, an upward of about $850 million in funded loans for dealers in that regard as well. And the whole
intention here is I think as JB pointed out a couple of times in his prepared remarks is really to focus on the
controllable, focus on keeping our market strong, our customers strong and we believe that's going to position us
very well on the back end of this crisis.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay thanks. And then just a follow-up here on the auction pricing that you were discussing, highlighting that
today's price for used cars is impacted by a very low level of participants in the auction. So how do I think about
how that feeds into your quarter's assessment of used car prices and how you think about the remarketing gains
et cetera this quarter? And then what is the trigger for a better price, is it a function of number of participants in
your opinion, or how you could help us understand how that should traject over the next few quarters?

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2020
Yeah sure. It's a really important area that we are focused on, as you think about our leasing yields and our
marketing gains. What we're seeing right now is essentially the market is illiquid in that physical auctions as well
as the digital auctions and so it's just really hard right now to determine what share pricing is. We were guiding
towards a negative 5% to 7% in used vehicle prices, it could potentially go down from there. It's just very difficult
to know at this point. And so we're a bit in wait and see mode. And we think we'll have a much clearer sense of
used car prices once shelter-in-place orders are lifted and auction activities can resume more normal levels.
Keep in mind, we are providing lease extensions to our customers and that helps to kind of manage the supply
dynamics relative to demand. And we think that overall positions the market to be stronger as well. But it's a really
important focus area for us and I think this is one of those areas to be determined as we go through the next
couple of quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
So how did that play into 1Q numbers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So first quarter we didn't really see any dynamics. I mean we were kind of neutral in terms of linked-quarter
remarketing gains and so it hasn't yet materialized Betsy
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
And I think Betsy, there's other potential offsets and positive catalysts out there. Obviously we're all waiting to see
what happens to public transportation. And there's Uber usage, Lyft usage subway, taxi, does that get negatively
impacted and people have to now own transportation once again and that sector is likely the – do in the former
years. So I mean all of these are things that we've got to balance. But I think as Jenn's pointing out, the short term
dynamics are really just they're so choppy, there's no liquidity in the markets and we're just trying to be very
thoughtful on what this implies going forward

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Nomura Instinet
Thanks. Good morning JB and Jenn. It's notable that at CECL you guys were able to actually grow tangible book
value per share sequentially despite the big reserve build this quarter. But with your stock trading at less than
50% of tangible book value per share, I think some investors are struggling with their assessment of the downside
risk to tangible book value. Can you offer some perspective on the historical 2008, 2009 credit performance of the
Ally's predecessor hided losses yet in retail auto, maybe discuss what changes are important to think about from
a credit perspective to the business from back then versus what the business is like today? And then maybe just
more broadly, any color that you could give us to maybe frame your confidence level and your ability to defend
tangible book value under your current reasonable and supportable assumptions?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Sure. Thank you for the question, Bill. It's a really good one and quite frankly we can't even get close to the
valuation numbers that we're seeing today. And I shared with you in my prepared remarks that we would expect in
a severely adverse scenario where we've got persistent broad-based macroeconomic deterioration for some time
to think about kind of an L shaped economy, we would expect then to hit loss levels of 2.5% to 3%.
Today if you look at our internal modeling relative to that severely adverse scenario, we are reserved at about
70% of that here in Q1. And if you look at the federal reserve modeling, which is significantly more punitive
especially on the commercial portfolios were about 50%. So we feel like we're perfectly and kind of smartly
reserved for what we're experiencing today. You asked about 2008, 2009, it's a little bit difficult to get apples-to-
apples just because we're in a different portfolio back then, but we give the NCOs and retail auto hit about 3% for
a very brief period of time, and then reversed back down and normalized very quickly within about six months or
so. But relative to 2008, 2009, relative to our severely adverse scenarios, we feel like we were well reserved at
this point, now obviously a lot of unknowns in terms of what the shape of the economy looks like, the severity of it,
but relative to past performance, we feel that we're in great shape.
Now I mean on your confidence, question on reasonable and supportable, I mean this is the question that is trying
to be answered across macroeconomists. At the end of March, we had built in kind of what we think of a 10%,
20% – unemployment approaching 10%, GDP declining by 20%, it has kind of deteriorated a little bit since then in
April, we're at kind of 15%, 30%. But there is a lot of ins and outs on our reserves. Moshe had asked the question
on the forbearance program, none of the benefit of that is built into our reserves. We are expecting our balance
sheet to come down and that'll give some offset to reserve build as well. So I think our overall confidence is about
as high as it can be right now, and we'll continue to manage and monitor it as we go into Q2 and beyond.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2020
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
The only thing I would add Bill, and Jenn covered it perfectly, but I mean if you, if you think about the $6.5 billion,
$7 billion discount to book, I mean there's not really a conceivable scenario that models that out. So it's been a
sudden and aggressive move down and we think through time and through our performance that will recover but
that gives us a lot of confidence of upside to come.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Nomura Instinet
That's Super helpful. Thank you. If I could just sneak in a quick follow-up on your CardWorks comments. Is it
possible to discuss whether the seller is considering his option to walk away from the deal and whether Ally would
be willing to incur the additional dilution to compel them to close the deal or maybe just a little bit little bit more to
the extent that you can offer us a little bit more color.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I'd just say, I'm not going to really comment right now, I mean we're in the process, as I said in the prepared
remarks obviously Don and his team and certainly Ally and our team didn't expect the severe drop off or fall off in
the economy to come. So, we're going through the process now. We'll make the right decisions on both sides that
are thoughtful for our shareholders, and our customers for the long-term. So, that's really all we can say.

Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan
Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions this morning. Jenn, in response to Betsy's question, you talked about
the store or the prior assumption of a 5% to 7% decline in used car prices. When you look at your – and I
appreciate the fact you guys have provided an update on NCO guidance. What are you thinking in terms of higher
loss frequency and higher loss severity?

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2020
Yeah. So, within our reserves and within that implied 1.8% to 2.1% retail auto, NCO, Rick, we have embedded
that we would have more material kind of likely pressure on the severity side as well as higher delinquency, it's
just pulling in past correlations that we have seen. So, think about that's kind of already embedded into that
reserve calculation. And in terms of just what happens with the lease portfolio, with respect to yields I think that's
the question that we're going to have to answer over the next couple of months and quarters as used vehicle
volume and demand starts to come back as shelter-in-place orders are lifted over time, but that's largely
embedded in that severity. Go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan
So to you put a fine point on this, you increased your severity assumption which makes sense but you have not
explicitly changed your used car price assumptions, you've just sort of generally assumed that severities are
going to go up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. That's a good way to look at it. I mean the point, if you're assuming higher credit losses, it's going to be a
combination of frequency and severity. And whether or not that plays out exactly we will see. And at some point it
will merge with overall used car prices and we'll continue to update it when we have more actual data coming out
of our auctions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q

Okay great. Thank you so much.

Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks, good morning. Appreciate all the commentary on reserves, just a couple of clarifications. One inside your
CECL window, are you assuming any type of economic recovery? And then some of the banks that have reported
up until now have talked about how the macro forecast have gotten weaker since quarter end, relative to that 10%
unemployment rate. So how should we think about future provision build and that assumption, I don't know what
your views are in terms of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah sure. Good morning Sanjay. So as we modeled reserves, keep in mind, it was kind of end of March time
period and the forecast that we had is more kind of a V-shape than an L-shape or U-shape at this point in time.
So we do have a bit of a recovery starting in Q3 and accelerating into Q4.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2020
Now that being said, we have not modeled in any of the potential benefits from stimulus or from our forbearance
programs, which are providing a lot more cash flow and flexibility around payments to our customers. And so, we
believe that overall will be a net positive, not included in our numbers. And also keep in mind that the size of our
balance sheet is likely to go down, which in a CECL world provides outside benefit as you move through the
quarter. So, we got to take a balanced view, the macroeconomic impact will materialize potentially as we go
through Q2, but there're some natural offsets there as well, so overall we feel like we're in a good position with our
current reserve number.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan
Okay. And then, I guess when I think about CardWorks, I know you can't really speak to whether or not that deal
will be consummated, it assumes like you guys are assuming it will. When we talked about the deal and sort of
the profitability of that business during the financial crisis, it was break even, I think at its worst in the end at the
worst point. In this backdrop with the accounting being what it is with CECL, should we expect worse than that?
Could you just help us think through the implications on profitability for CardWorks assuming the unemployment
rates you are?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer LaClair A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean Sanjay, look I think CardWorks is similar to every other financial services industry right now, they're
focusing on controllables, what can they do to help their customers, they're monitoring things very closely. As a
first quarter, nothing has materialized relative to COVID-19. And so, it's just really hard to say exactly how this is
going to play out. And I think JB said it perfectly, we're in constant dialogue with that team, we have a lot of
confidence and their ability to navigate cycles based on over the past 30 years and we'll continue to monitor and
partner with them, but at this time, it's just a little bit too early to be decisive on what exactly their profitability is
going to look like. I mean it's difficult for us to do that for Ally as well keep in mind.
