M. Terry Turner
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thank you, operator, and thank you for joining us this morning. By way of introduction, I would say that the first
quarter of 2022 was another outstanding quarter for us. I think the power of our ability to attract the best and
experienced bankers in our markets, both in the legacy markets and in the market extensions translates that
hiring into outsized high quality grow was on full display again this quarter. In addition, all the macro issues that
have created a great deal of economic uncertainty, the industry also has a number of other headwinds like
outrunning the loss of PPP revenues as those loans pay off and like substantial reduction in mortgage loan
originations during the rate moment, they pretty well eliminated the robust mortgage refinance market we've
enjoyed for several years just to name a few.
Our belief has been that our ability to overcome those headwinds would be our ability to produce outsized
balance sheet growth. And so I think that's the most important story line for us here in the first quarter. We've
begun every quarterly conference call with this dashboard for years, beginning with the GAAP measures. I'll focus
first on the credit metrics along the bottom row. The green bar show our median quarterly performance over the
last five years, and as you can see, our asset quality over the last five years have been very strong. But even so,
again, this quarter for all three measures problem loan metrics continued to trend down and are decade long
lows.
Our five-year median for NPAs to loans and ORE is an incredible 46 basis points, Q1 they were just 14 basis
points. Our five-year median for classified asset ratio is just 12%. Q1, it was 3.6%. Our five-year median
annualized net charge-off ratio is 10 basis points. Q1, it was 5 basis points. And honestly, it's hard to get too much
better than that. Moving now to the non-GAAP measures, which are the ones I generally most focus on, let's look
at the top row chart first. As you can see, revenues and fully diluted EPS continued their upward slope. Adjusted
pre-tax pre-provision net income was actually flattish, down just a tick. We weren't quite able to outrun the
impacts, reduced PPP revenue and mortgage origination fees in this quarter, because I mentioned a few
moments ago, I do expect to outrun those headwinds this year based on our outlook for loan growth going
forward. More on that later.
Now, looking at the second row, as I've already outlined, loan and deposit volumes continued to grow at a double-
digit pace. EOP loans were up 18.5% annualized and 22.5% annualized, excluding the impact of PPP. Core
deposits were up 14.8%, and I would say that that growth is directly tied to the growth in non-interest expense
we've invested over the last year or two. At the tangible book value per share, we actually saw our first reduction
there in more than five years with interest rates rising, we saw a decrease of 2.1% this quarter, primarily due to
the impacts on accumulated other comprehensive income. On a peer relative basis, I believe our conservative
balance sheet has held us in relatively good stead there.
Along those lines early in the quarter we transferred approximately $1.1 billion of available-for-sale securities to
held-to-maturity in order to help counter the impact of rising rates on tangible equity. Harold will talk more about
that in just a minute also. So in summary, based on our previous investment in revenue producers, we're
continuing to grow our balance sheet in an outsized pace. We're translating that into revenue and earnings
growth, and our asset quality is blemish free.

So with that, I'll turn it over to Harold for more detail looking toward.

Harold R. Carpenter
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thanks, Terry. Good morning, everybody. As usual, we'll start with loans, and the first quarter was likely one of
the strongest loan growth quarter for us in our history, and with our current pipelines provides us with much
confidence as we enter the second quarter. Even inclusive of PPP pay-downs, average loans were up 14.7%
annualized between the first and fourth quarters. And as we mentioned in the press release last night, upping our
guidance to at least mid-teen percentage growth for this year is reasonable for us. Loan rates were down in the
first quarter due to reduced impact of PPP on our loan yields. We recognized $10.8 million in PPP revenues in the
first quarter, down from $15.5 million in the fourth quarter.
PPP balances decreased to approximately $157 million in the first quarter, and consistent with what we discussed
last quarter, we believe the 2022 PPP revenues will likely range between $15 million and $20 million, compared to
approximately $86 million in 2021. We are down about $25 million in PPP loan volume so far in the second
quarter, so not much left to go related to PPP. That said, PPP was a huge program for this bay, and a big thank
you to all those that were connected with getting PPP up and running, because from a client service perspective
and our desiring to get a client for life, PPP very much enhanced our standing with our client base.
Also, we did see some uptick in commercial line utilization this quarter. First time that has happened in quite a
while, and we have some reason to believe that increases could continue this year as borrowers look to lock in
inventories at current price levels. We also anticipate increases in construction fundings through the spring and
summer. More on borrowers when I speak to credit in a few minutes. We've responded to a lot of questions about
loan floors over the past year or so, and their impact on our yields in a rising rate environment. Again, we do not
apologize for our loan floors, because we've realized the ongoing benefit of these floors for quite some time.
During the first quarter given the impact from a recent 25 basis point increase in short-term rates, approximately
$824 million in loans escaped their floors and are now priced based on their original loan spreads. As the bottom
left chart on the slide indicates, we have about $2.2 billion of our floating rate loans that should push through floor
pricing with the next 50 basis point rise, which we anticipate will occur next month. Many are focused on deposit
betas, but at this bank we're also focused on the loan beta, and making sure we achieve a stronger push in loan
yields as possible as rates increase. As we mentioned in the press release, we're pleased to see approximately a
6-basis point lift in aggregate loan yields after only four weeks post the latest Fed increase.
As the top chart indicates, we experienced strong yields in the 5.2% range back in 2019. Now, that was a much
different time and we don't expect achieving those levels this year, but we could make a strong dent in the current
delta between where yields are now in those prior levels. Lastly, as to loans, our market leaders are excited about
our loan growth prospects and about a mid-teens percentage growth rate, which is inclusive of PPP paydowns.
Additionally, in 2021, our new markets, including Atlanta and our new special lending units provided
approximately $530 million in loan growth. For the first quarter and including JB&B, they incremented our loan
growth by $386 million or 35% of our 1Q 2022 EOP loan growth. And we expect strong participations from our
new markets in the second quarter as well.
Now on to deposits. We had yet another big deposit growth quarter. Deposits were up almost $1.1 billion in the
first quarter. We don't anticipate that sort of growth in the second quarter with tax payments and with some
projected deposit outflows by some relatively large depositors, but still believe that high single-digit growth in core
deposits remains a reasonable target for us for this year. So no change there. Our average deposit rates
decreased to 13 basis points, while end of period deposit rates were slightly higher than average at 14 basis

points. Since the last FOMC meeting, our deposit rates are up almost 2 basis points. So we're pleased with the
effort of our relationship managers thus far.
We've never abandoned our view that core deposit growth is a key, long-term strategic objective. For the first 20
years of our existence, our number one goal was developing strategies and tactics around funding our growth.
We continue to like our chances, given the significant investment we've made in both relationship managers and
new markets over the last few years. We also like our start point on deposit cost as we enter an upgrade cycle.
We continue to forecast an aggregate 40% of beta on total deposit growth cost through the cycle, but we'll keep
an eye on what our competitors are doing given they are advertising much less betas, which we believe gives us
some breathing room, at least initially.
Now to liquidity deployment. We continue to look at ways to create increased earnings momentum through
deployment of excess liquidity into higher yielding assets. Our liquid assets actually increased this quarter
corresponding with strong core deposit growth and the impact of PPP paydowns. We are optimistic that loan
growth in 2022 should serve to reduce our overall liquidity, but in our view, this will be a multiyear effort. Again,
our objective here is to find ways to put money to work in a rising rate environment without placing unreasonable
pressure on our tangible book value.
During the first quarter, our investment securities increased in total by approximately 1%, as we continue to
reinvest cash flows from the bond book back into the bond book. The increase in balances actually represented a
decrease in our bonds to total asset ratio, which was 15.6% at March 31. We do believe we have some
opportunities on the short end of the curve to put some money to work at slightly higher yields, and did some of
that in the first quarter. We will continue to have a modest, measured response in how we elect to put liquidity to
work in this rate environment.
We did execute the transfer of about $1.1 billion in securities from AFS to HTM. Doing so did help support
tangible book value by almost $0.73 per share in the first quarter. As the grey bars on the top left chart reflect, I
believe we've done a remarkable job retaining our core margins over the last few years. We tend to hover in the
3.2% to 3.25% range, and we'll work hard to lift our margins going forward. Given the operating environment, we
have confidence that we should see some margin expansion, along with increased net interest income, this year.
We are upping our guidance on net interest income to low double-digit growth for 2022 over last year.
As to credit, we're again presenting our traditional credit metrics. Pinnacle's loan portfolio continued to perform
very well, and again, these are some of the best credit metric ratios we've experienced ever. Modifications made
pursuant to Section 4013 of the CARES Act continued to decrease and was at $660 million at March 31, 2022.
Importantly, over 91% of our Section 4013 credits are on monthly principal paydowns, likely a similar amortization
to pre-COVID, and only 1% of the Section 4013 loans are in a classified risk category.
Importantly, and as noted on the highlights in the slide, we do anticipate further declines in our allowance for
credit losses to total loans ratio over the next several quarters, given continued improvement in our credit metrics,
as well as macroeconomic factors. We've had a lot of conversation with borrowers over the last few months about
inflation and how it's impacting their businesses. So far so good; our truckers, our hospitality borrowers,
apartment owners, etcetera, are thus far able to pass along price increases to their customers. The biggest issue
that most I'll point to is labor and finding enough labor to grow their businesses. Backlogs for some are some of
the highest levels ever. Obviously, we all need inflation to slow down and supply chains to be less of an issue. We
can only hope that over the next few quarters, we will all get our arms around some of these issues.

Now on to fees as for run rates for 2022 and for BHG, we are maintaining our estimate of approximately 20%
growth, and we'll speak to that in a few minutes. Also included in our planning assertion is that we are not
anticipating a repeat of $20 million in income we've experienced in 2021 from valuation adjustments for several of
our joint venture investments. Thus we are planning for revenues from these investments to be much less in
2022. Other than that, our wealth management and several other fee-based business lines believe they are ready
for a breakout year in 2022, and believe that an aggregate 7% to 9% increase in all of our other remaining fee
categories is reasonable for us for this year.
A lot of interest in our mortgage forecast for 2022, we lowered expectations for this year not only because rates
were increasing, but housing stock in our markets were at levels that home sales are being impacted. And along
with that, the price of housing has increased significantly, with some amazing stories [ph] we still are (00:15:15)
receiving above list price has become fairly common. Additionally, there are a large percentage of cash buyers
acquiring homes in our markets as our markets continue to attract jobs and people from other states where
housing costs have been much higher for many years.
As to expenses, we are increasing our overall total expense run rate from low double-digit percentage growth in
2020 to the mid-teen percentage growth. This increase is primarily attributable to head count growth in the new
markets, market disruption initiatives across our market, the addition of JB&B, and our belief that we should likely
approach max payouts for cash incentives this year. As a reminder, as we mentioned last time, our current plan is
that our incentives will increase in 2022, should we achieve some fairly aggressive performance stories.
The increase is based on head count adds in 2021 and our planned recruiting adds for this year, offsetting the
increases that we are reducing our target payout and our annual cash bonus plan from an outsized amount of
160% of target last year to the traditional 125% of target this year. We are also providing more costs for our equity
plans for our leadership. Lots of discussion currently about expense growth, particularly in the large cap space.
Not sure why their costs are escalating, but our expense increases are primarily attributable to the successful
recruitment of new bankers, who will help drive our growth over the next several years. Terry will discuss more on
that point in a few minutes. We believe in our organic growth model, and we'll continue to lean into it as the
opportunities to hire established revenue producers in our markets has never been better.
At capital, we did see 2% pullback on tangible book value per share with the impact of increased rates on AOCI
and tangible book value per share. Just to reiterate the point, our leadership's equity compensation plans are
designed to perform upon how we rank with our peers on tangible book value growth. So, our leadership is
focused on growing tangible book value over the longer term. Our strategy and tactics are focused on building
franchise value using the organic growth model over the long term. That includes a focus on earnings growth,
revenue growth, [ph] sales (00:17:36) and tangible book value per share.
Quickly, as to an update on our outlook for 2022, as for loans, we've increased our outlook to mid-teens growth
for 2022 and are optimistic about how the second quarter is shaping up. We are adjusting our rate forecast to six
rate increases from three last time [ph] and advice (00:17:55) that we could increase that assumption again here
shortly, given that we believe we should see NIM improvement this year, which should result in net interest
income growth of low double-digits.
We've also increased our expense outlook for increased hires and other factors to mid-teens percentage growth.
We are very optimistic that hiring will ramp up here in the near term. All in, we are thinking that we are going to
have a really strong year [ph] all pointed (00:18:22). Obviously, inflation and macro events will influence how all
this hopefully turns out, but as for our group, we will work to balance the risk of whatever comes our way, with an
intense focus on growing the franchise value of this firm.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
Now quickly to BHG, another quarter of record originations. The gap between origination and sold loans has
widened, as BHG has been holding more loans on its balance sheet. We anticipate that BHG may accelerate
sales into their bank network, as capital market interest rates have been volatile of late, while the auction platform
continues to be super reliable, which is obviously one of their great competitive benefits as BHG can quickly pivot
between the bank network and the securitization network during times such as these. Once BHG can better
determine the impact of rising rates on a securitization platform, they will likely go back to it. More on that in a
second.
Spread continue to expand in the first quarter, some of the wide spreads in their history. With rates rising, spreads
may decrease some, but at these margins, BHG has the capacity to execute its business model with a great deal
of confidence regardless of some shrinkage in spreads. The bottom line chart details the 1,400-plus banks in
BHG's network and just over 600 unique buyers in the last 12 months. As you know, we're considered one of the
strongest – we're considered the strongest funding platform in the country for companies in our space and that
there is a significant hunger for more products.
As many of you know, the recourse obligation is reserved for potential loss absorption for the sold loan portfolio.
At the end of the first quarter, recourse reserves were up slightly at approximately $208 million, while the ratio of
sold loans decreased modestly to 4.82%. The blue bars on the bottom right chart show the credit portion of
recourse losses for 1Q 2022 are some of the lowest levels in the past 10 years.
The quality of BHG's borrowing base in our opinion remains impressive and is much stronger than just a few
years ago. BHG refreshes credit scores monthly, always looking for signs of weakness. Past dues and credit
scores are at consistent levels, and the portfolio appears to be as strong as it's ever been. National and regional
unemployment gives them confidence that BHG borrowers should be able to withstand forecasted inflationary
increase. They and we believe in their credit models and their experience gives them reason to do so.
BHG had another great operating quarter in the first quarter. We still believe BHG's earnings growth for 2022 over
2021 will be at least 20%, which is consistent with our discussion from last quarter. Originations, as noted in the
bottom right chart are anticipated to grow at least 30% this year, which is also consistent with our last quarter's
discussion. With $855 million in originations in the first quarter, they are at a good pace to achieve that growth.
As I mentioned earlier, with the volatility in rates, BHG believes revenues in their earlier quarters of 2022 will likely
be stronger as they likely send more loans to the bank auction platform rather than hold loans on their balance
sheet until they can better understand how the securitization markets are and will be behaving. They are hopeful
that as the year plays out, BHG will pivot back and retain more loans on its balance sheet. As to the balance
sheet model and as the slide indicates, BHG closed their fourth securitization in the first quarter. It amounted to
$492 million, with a weighted average funding rate of 2.79%. Loans that securitized a debt had a weighted
average [ph] steep line (00:22:08) of 14.1%.
So with that, I will turn it back over to Terry to wrap up.

All right. Thank you, Harold. In our view, the economic landscape remains fragile. Russia's invasion in Ukraine
and various economic sanctions enacted in response are likely to continue to weigh on our economy for some
time. The full impact of the ongoing supply chain issues, inflation, inverted yield curves and a potential recession
aren't yet known. But our response as far – as Harold's already mentioned, has really been to seek to protect our

tangible book value to initiate a number of targeted loan portfolio reviews, including our COVID impacted and
commercial real estate portfolios, and to heighten our diligence on cybersecurity and fraud detection. But despite
the uncertain economic environment, we're extremely pleased with our first quarter performance and remain
optimistic for 2022.
As a result of our prolific hiring over the last year, not only are we realizing an outsized growth in our legacy
Tennessee, Carolina and Virginia markets, but we're also having great success in our market extensions to
Atlanta, Washington, D.C., Birmingham and Huntsville. The prolific hiring continued during the first quarter with 28
additional revenue producers. The loan growth we experienced here in the first quarter, along with our current
loan pipelines and our continued ability to attract new associates have bolstered our confidence that we should
meet or exceed mid-teen percentage loan growth for this year.
Not only that, but there is tremendous market disruption in our markets and we believe we are uniquely suited to
capitalize on that. We fully expect to seize this opportunity by continuing to hire the best, most experienced
bankers in our markets and consolidate their books. This company was formed for the purpose of capitalizing on
market disruption due to the consolidation 22 years ago. This is who we are. As I look at our current environment,
this literally feels to me like the best market opportunity that we've ever had.
I don't think it's a secret to anyone that merger integration pose great risk. For those banks that are involved,
these are extraordinarily difficult. Culture war generally commence and persist. Invariably, there'll be winners and
losers in those organizations and a great deal of the revenue is lost as associates and clients get frustrated and
leave. Happily, these are the current integrations going on in the markets we serve.
Here's a great way to think about the magnitude of the vulnerability that that creates and on which we're focused.
This is FDIC deposit market share data. Obviously, you can use other measures, but this is a pretty good proxy
for the potential vulnerabilities in the markets we serve as a result of consolidation, or in the case of Wells, other
ongoing issues.
Taking these 12 markets as a whole, I would say that $325 billion is vulnerable and even though this company
was formed to take advantage of the same kind of merger-related turmoil following the consolidation in the 1990s,
frankly, I've never in my life seen competitor vulnerability at this level. We've successfully exported what we
started in Nashville by de novo market extensions as well as via M&A. I have spent some time demonstrating the
success of BNC merger several quarters ago, so today I want to highlight our most recent market extensions.
Merger-related turmoil has really catalyzed our entry into four new markets and two new specialty lending
practices, equipment finance and franchise lending. And this is a snapshot of our progress, which I think you'll
agree is rapid.
In Atlanta, we successfully hired 42 associates, 24 of them revenue producing. At quarter end, they had $1 billion
in loan commitments, nearly $600 million in loan outstandings. And as you can see, they're already through
breakeven. Huntsville and Birmingham, Alabama, have now been with us for just three quarters. In Huntsville,
we've hired 12 associates, 6 of them revenue producing. We've still got a great hiring pipeline in front of us. Loan
production is not bad but deposit production is off the chart. They're almost breakeven in just three quarters.
Birmingham, as it relates to loan and deposit volumes is sort of the opposite story. Similar hiring levels, fabulous
loan production. And in D.C., we've just been there four months, we've had great initial hiring success with a
continuing large pipeline for hires. Balance sheet volumes barely scratch the surface yet, but pipeline looks
massive to me. I cannot tell you how excited I am about what I believe we're going to build there.

And finally, I mentioned two new specialties for equipment finance and franchise lending, both less than a year
old. You can see that like the other markets, we've had strong hiring and really rapid loan growth. So only in last
quarter, the EPS drag was about $0.03. Because we're growing core volume so rapidly, we can absorb that drag
and still outgrow peers in terms of earnings. And you can see the pace at which we are continuing to build out.
We've been talking for quite some time about the number of revenue producers that we're hiring because
honestly, that's the principal theme for the success we've enjoyed for a good number of years now.
Revenue producers include financial advisors. Many of you would refer to them as relationship managers, but
also include other revenue producers like mortgage originators, brokers, trust administrators and the like. But just
for one moment, I want to direct you to just the number of balance sheet loan and deposit producers as a subset
of the revenue producers. In order to provide a simple illustration of how we convert new hires, to say, on balance
sheet volumes which translates to revenue growth. We hire all kinds of experienced loan and deposit producers,
not trainees, not rookies, but producers with at least 10 years' experience with their own book of business, small
business FAs, private banking FAs, commercial middle-market FAs, corporate FAs and so forth.
And the volumes associated with each type of those FAs vary but if you took the average since 2018 for all types
of FAs, our new hires generally consolidate their book over five years. Volumes continue to build post five years
but for today we just want to concentrate on the first five years. On average, loans build $8 million in balances in
year one, $28 million in year two, $30 million in year three, $44 million in year four, $56 million in year five.
Deposit growth is noted on the chart on the top right. Both of these charts on the top are intended to illustrate how
we go about our planning.
There's a lot of numbers, but essentially intended to illustrate our planning assumptions for the balance sheet
growth associated with new hires and the market share consolidation over the last four plus years. I don't want
you to miss this. This is an incredibly powerful growth engine to have already built. The table at the bottom
aggregates volumes for the same 176 financial advisors that we've hired, what our planning assumption is for new
volume growth for 2022 and future periods, again based on historical averages and for 2022 thus far, we would
expect these same individuals to generate $6.4 billion in loan volumes. That number is about $2.2 billion in growth
over the previous year. That's how it works.
And all we've talked about here is just the balance sheet growth, but there are meaningful fee revenues that go
with that as well. So the obvious point is as a shareholder, given these volumes, making this investment in these
experienced producers, it's hard to beat. Here's another way to think about our ability to grow the revenues. This
is a chart that's really important to me, normally its relegated to the back of the deck and we haven't addressed it
on the call for a few years. But the reason it's important to me is because first and foremost, we're an earnings per
share focused company and our path to produce that earnings growth is through revenue per share, sustainable
revenue per share through franchise value creation, not expense cutting.
The blue bars plot our revenue per share growth since first quarter of 2018. And you can see it's a pretty steep
and reliable slope. The green dash line is the year-over-year percentage growth in revenue per share. The red
dash line is the same for peers. And so I'd point out a couple things. Number one, we grow revenue per share
quarter in and quarter out. Two, we almost always grow it faster than peers and not by a little, by a lot. And during
2021, the gap to peers in terms of the rate of growth in revenue per share has widened every quarter.
So we have quite a track record for successfully investing in growth. Ferdinand Foch was a French general in
World War I of assumed notoriety, I've actually used this famous quote before, but I feel somewhat the same way.
The economy is volatile at best and collapsed at worst, there's significant headwinds associated with things like

competitive landscape is tilted our way. We're attracting talent and clients at a dramatic pace. And we expect to
continue top quartile EPS growth based on top quartile revenue growth.
Operator, we'll be glad to stop there and take questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Turner. The floor is open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] The first question
comes from Brett Rabatin with Hovde Group.

Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Hey, guys. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Good morning, Brett.

Hey, Brett.

Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Congrats on a really strong quarter. That's some impressive loan growth. Wanted to first start with BHG. Usually
when I'm having a conversation about you guys, it's within the first 30 seconds that BHG comes up. And so I think
it's a big focus. Wanted to get an update on any thoughts on that investment and their thoughts on what they
might do to either monetize there or to look to capitalize on the strength and wanted to see what you thought the
margin – Harold, you talked about spreads, how much spread compression you think that business might be
seeing here in the next few quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, Brett. I'll answer the second question first. They don't think spread compression is going to be that great
here in the near term. They have been successful with coupon rates north of 15%, 16% in the past. So they feel
like they can move rates up with borrowers. They do think that the buy side or the auction platform side that they'll
have to probably be a little more aggressive to get those rates up a little bit. But, say, perhaps some spread
compression of maybe 1% or maybe 2%, something like that. But they don't think it's going to be – put that big of
a dent into their business model.
Now, over the years, we've had all kinds of conversations about liquidity events and when the market's right and
when the market's not right. I think current belief is that the market is not shaping up to their advantage currently.
They think they've got a lot of growth and a lot of runway in front of them. So they will likely be focused on growing
the revenues of their firm because they believe that as they grow their revenues, they too will see increased

franchise value at some point whenever that occurs and there's a liquidity event. I think Al and Eric and Pinnacle
were all on the same page. We have a great partnership. We communicate frequently.
That said, I do believe that Al and Eric are at a point personally that they think that they need to keep their eyes
open and aware of what's going on in the various fintech lending markets and what kind of appetite there might be
for their firm who they believe is very profitable and they're very proud of it. So, I don't know if anything – like,
we've always said, and I know the buy-siders get tired of me saying this, but it's still the truth, we don't know if
there's a liquidity event this year, next year, or five years from now, but we do know there'd likely to be one. And
when that occurs, we hope to enjoy a very nice gain. And we hope to be able to look at a variety of options on
how we execute on that gain.
So with that, I'll stop, see if Terry has got any additional comments or whatever, so...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
No, I wouldn't have anything.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. Appreciate the color on BHG. Wanted to ask about the margin as well. Just when I look at your filings, it
seems like they would suggest that you're being somewhat conservative with your assumptions for 100 to 200
basis point rises in rates. Just given the liquidity that you still have on the balance sheet, can you talk maybe
about the assumptions that go into your upside for NII and then just talk about what re-price is in the first 90 days
on the loan portfolio following a rate hike?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Well, I think the advantage we got here in the near term is that we anticipate a 50 basis point increase in
rates from the Fed. And so that's going to take a little over $2 billion in loans out from their floors and put them
back on what another coupon is. But what we do is we're talking to our market leaders. We're trying to anticipate
what they think their growth is going to be over the next several quarters, and then we just fashion that on out. We
also look at what our pricing has traditionally been and use that as the forward – on the forward curve. Some
people might say it's not rocket science, but there are a blue million assumptions that go into this forecast.
And just to get on my soapbox just for a second, because I know time is precious, the disclosures that we include
regarding our asset sensitivity in the back are primarily weighted towards what the regulators generally require.
And so it's a stable balance sheet and a parallel shift in the curve and all those kind of assumptions that go into it,
and it really lacks a lot of creativity and a lot of ingenuity that we're always thinking about around here to improve
both the earnings content of our firm, as well as what we think our growth is going to be.
So, we've got several levers here that we can pull periodically that helps us either in the near term, the short term
or the long term, and that's what we'll do. And so what we try to do is provide that information that's in that asset
sensitivity table, but at the same time, kind of get you to a real-world kind of growth perspective that we think is
going to – is more likely.

Operator: Our next question comes from Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Rau Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo
Hi. This is Jon Rau on for Jared. How are you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Good, Jon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Rau Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo
I just wanted to go back to the comment earlier in the prepared remarks about line utilization was a benefit this
quarter. I was hoping you could just quantify how much that increased from the fourth quarter and what the dollar
impact of that was, and I guess if there's any further for that to go as we move through the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, Jon, I'm looking for the slide 35 in the back. I think generally we'll give you that information. So, I think
commercial real estate lines went up – the active balances on commercial real estate went up $370 million, $322
million on C&I. So, the utilization went up 0.5% on commercial real estate and 0.8% on C&I.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
So, Jon, just my color commentary in addition to that slide and Harold's comments, I think you asked at the end if
we see an opportunity for that to pick up speed. I think the answer to that is yes. I mean, there's sort of two
components to it. One is the sort of inevitable fund up of construction loans, so that utilization ought to pick up.
And then secondly, in the case of C&I, my belief is that if the economy moves forward, it spins the sales cycle and
that results in receivable and inventory financing line utilization and the like. So, depending upon what your
economic outlook is, if you think the economy is going to find a good footing, you ought to expect line utilization to
pick up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Rau Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo
Okay. That's very helpful. And then just on the rate hike assumptions, does the faster assumption in increases in
short-term rates impact your beta assumptions at all, like moving to a 50 basis point hike in May versus kind of
spread out throughout the year, does that kind of ramp up how quickly you have to pass through that on the
depositors?

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Our planning would be that initially, our beta will be relatively small, and that over the course of the rate
cycle, we increase the beta up meaningfully.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Rau Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo
Okay. So the pace of hikes is factored into that now?

Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
For sure. Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Rau Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo
Okay, great. Thank you. And then, sorry, just one last one for me. On the prepared remarks, you talked about six
rate hikes being assumed in the guidance, but on the slides, I'm seeing six additional hikes throughout the rest of
the year. I am just wondering if the actual guidance assumes six or seven total for the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, we're thinking six more for the rest of this year.

as you've been talking to them and some of the macro clouds have darkened materially year-to-date or at least

gotten more uncertain, how much discussion has there been internally in terms of, okay, if we are less
comfortable with the environment, what would need to happen? Do we need to narrow the credit box, drop
guidance on loan growth, boost reserves, like how much of those discussions have been happening behind the
curtain?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, the only – my exposure to BHG is through their board meetings, and we have access to their – obviously to
their credit people. I'm not sure how much increased diligence; I can't really put a measurement on that other than
that they are looking at their portfolio statistics. They've added people into their credit units and so on and so forth.
So they, like us, have an enterprise wide risk group that is trying to look out and around the corners. I don't know
if that's exactly giving what you wanted, Brock, but that's where I'm headed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. That's close enough. And separately, Harold, just on your Pinnacle's reserve guidance. We've repeatedly
estimated way to the high side in provisioning. It sounds like we should be expecting this neighborhood of
provisioning near to intermediate term as that reserve continues to trend down. Am I on target there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think so. We have a stronger charge-off forecast for this year in our numbers. But I think that's just out of
caution. When I talk to the credit officers, they're really excited about where the book is. We've had now a string of
probably four quarters where provisioning has been a lot less than even we anticipated. So there may be some
elevation towards the back end of the year.

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I wanted to start, Terry, on slide 23, you have quite a few markets where First Horizon has really strong market
shares. I'm curious, based on your experience in these local markets, do you see this is a similar opportunity to
what happened with Truist or do you think this could be even better from a talent acquisition perspective? What's
your take there?

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I would say comparable to be honest with you. Steven, I think, you know this. I would say if you and I'm speaking
off the top of my head, I'd have to go get numbers to prove it, but what I believe is if you looked at over the last
five years, SunTrust would have been the principal benefactor to us in terms of new hires. I think when you make
it a more recent time period, meaning, over the last two or three years, that evolved to Wells being the biggest
benefactor for us. And so today, I think the [indiscernible] (00:46:12) sort of moving back to Truist, there's lots of
vulnerability there. And so, I don't know, my own sense of it is First Horizon is probably going to be a comparable
thing for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then on the next slide, Terry, where you break out this once in a generation opportunity,
these different markets, from a big picture view where do you see the revenue producers moving to in these
markets? I'm not looking for an exact number. But is this the start of these other markets moving towards Atlanta
and Atlanta continuing forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, I think so. There's size differences in those markets. And so Atlanta and D.C. are the grand markets just in
terms of the total size and growth dynamics. And so, when we go into those and we hire leadership in those
markets, part of our discussion centers around how do you think you can build a $3 billion bank over a five-year
period of time or something. And so, that would be indicative of what we set out to do in those big markets.
Huntsville and Birmingham are meaningfully smaller markets and so the penetration should be similar in those
markets, maybe even better, but the growth opportunity and the number of revenue producers that we hire in
those markets will be less. But, yeah, just sitting here today, Steve, I love what's going on in Atlanta. I'll be
shocked if we don't run faster in D.C. than even in Atlanta, I don't know. We just have to see. But I am so
encouraged by what's going on there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's good color. And then finally I'll get Harold into the mix. On deposit rates, so the end of period deposit
rates were up modestly. Maybe, Harold, what's going on behind the scenes? You have many customers now
asking for a higher rate. How are the RMs handling that? And maybe what are you seeing from competitor banks
on that front? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, we are – first of all, we're not seeing anything from competitor banks. So, I don't think competitors
are increasing rates of any consequence at all. We are getting phone calls from various clients that tend to focus
on their rate and we are working with those clients as you might expect us to do, and they're primarily the ones.
Look, now we do have several clients that are on an indexed deposit rate pricing scale. So they obviously got
increased rates.
But, there's a lot of our client base out there, the not-for-profits and the churches and those kind of businesses
where they pay attention to every last nickel and so we expect them to call and you should expect us to work with
them. So, that's what's really going on. We're not a lot of the operating companies that are around, a few are

calling, but most of the operating companies are more concerned about where they're going to get their next
person to put on the line, to drive the truck, to do those sort of things.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And based on, Harold, what you expected, right, from an exception pricing view, is it about in line what
you've seen so far in terms of the number of requests coming in for exception pricing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, I think we're doing a little better than I would have thought. I would have thought with that 25 basis point rise
that we would see more increase on our deposit cost, because we look at it every day and we particularly took
interest when the Fed increased rates 25 basis points. So we had some inclination as to what rates would do
given the indexed accounts. But I think, I really do and I meant that in the comment is that, my hats off to my
relationship managers because I think they're doing a great job in explaining to our clients where we are in this
rate cycle.

Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Rose with Raymond James.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to get an update on how many or how much
loans you guys are adding from BHG each quarter, and if that would be expected to increase – I know they did a
securitization in February and could be a little tougher given the environment. So just want to get a sense for how
much of this quarter's growth and then maybe expectations for adding BHG loans are kind of built into the
guidance for the year. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, Michael. I don't think we added any loans in the first quarter from BHG. If we added any, it was about $25
million. And I think what we've always communicated between us and them is that, we may look to add $150
million or so this year. But I'm not sure if we added any here in the first quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then maybe just switching to credit quality, obviously things are really good, but clearly some
potential clouds on the horizon. If I look at post day one CECL, I mean, it's definitely lower than where the reserve
is now and you talk about that going down. Can you just kind of talk about the countervailing forces there in terms

of improving credit metrics versus kind of what could happen out on the horizon, and what that could mean for
provisions and reserves? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think the influence to CECL for us would be that the migration period in the past is gradually moving
forward and credit metrics are improving with that. So that'll put downward pressure on it. And the same thing
exists with respect to the forward outlook. There's less near-term kind of macroeconomic pressure on a reserved
bill. So I think those two things will, in combination, give us more confidence that the reserve will likely go down
than up here over the next at least the next couple of quarters. Now, we don't expect it to get down into the kind of
the day one CECL area code. We don't think that'll happen. But we do think we've got some more room here, like
I said, over the next couple of quarters.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey. Thanks. Good morning. And I want to go back to the discussion of the impact of higher rates on the bank.
And my question is really on new loan spreads. And on page 33, you gave us a good summary. But with higher
rates, I know you're hoping to see that flow into the new loan originations. I'm curious with your expectations are
for this year. It seems like the market is assuming that many of your competitors also have really strong liquidity,
like Pinnacle does, like really slow down the list of the new spreads. But curious what your expectations are this
year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Matt, this is Harold. I think for new loan originations we hope to get kind of a similar spreads to the what the
book is currently. Our planning assumption is that, we'd likely won't that in order to bring new borrower across the
street we probably won't get the 100% loan beta that we anticipate that we'd like to get out of our current book. So
there is some caution built in to what pricing is going to be on the new credit that we're looking.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then I guess, just taking a step back and thinking about Pinnacle rate sensitivity more broadly
throughout the cycle, it seems like last rate cycle, the bank performed pretty well the first half the cycle, but then
deposit costs accelerated in the back half. So I guess, what are the expectations for this cycle? I mean, it sounds
like you think that deposit betas could be lower given the higher levels of liquidity, but what else should we think
about in terms of how the bank's balance sheet has changed since a few years ago? Thanks.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
Yeah, I don't know if there's a whole lot significant change in how our balance sheet is built. As far as on the left
side, I think our bond book is probably, maybe a couple of percentage points bigger than what it was back in the
last upgrade cycle. Obviously, this liquidity has influenced how our balance sheet has moved since the last time.
And I think that gives us some comfort that maybe the deposit beta won't be as significant this time as it was last
time. But I think beyond the structure of the balance sheet, I think just the macro environment here where there is
massive liquidity and modest loan demand, there's a pretty different phenomenon than what we faced before. So I
think that will have more impact perhaps than just changes to the structure of the balance sheet.

Hey Jennifer.

Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Terry, could you kind of elaborate on your commentary on your optimism for the greater Washington D.C.
market? And then my second question is on Pinnacle's buyback appetite right now. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Okay. Yeah, I think in the case of Washington, D.C., Jennifer, so it just starts with a large market with high growth.
As you know, beyond that, for us, the whole story is about people and who are the people that you hire and where
they come from, and who else can they hire and what business can they move and all those sorts of things. And
so, I'm just – it's still in early stages. As you saw on the slide there, the balance sheet volumes have barely
scratched the surface there in the first four months, but the pipeline is very large.
And again, you can't celebrate until you get it booked. But my belief is they'll be successful in getting it booked,
and they're off to a really rapid pace on hiring, and their pipeline for hiring is also large. And so, the combination of
the people that are there, the long pipelines that they've generated, and the hiring pipelines that also are building
is the basis for my optimism.

Yeah, Jennifer, this is Harold. I'm not really – I don't think we're at a point to execute on any kind of buybacks right
now. One thing that we do consider in buybacks is what our loan growth forecast looks like. And so currently it
looks like our loan growth is going to be fairly significant, and we'll look at that in relation to capital. So, right now, I
think we're probably on a hold. But obviously, if we see more pressure on the stock, then we might start wading in
and trying to defend the stock with a little more effort.

Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Scouten with Piper Sandler.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, good morning, guys. Appreciate the time. Terry, I'm curious just how you're thinking about loan growth from
a market expansion standpoint. If I do the math on the slide you laid out for the new hires, it looks like maybe
that's about 10% growth just on their potential. So I'm guessing the next amount to get to the up teens is more
market expansion. Is that a fair way to think about it, and how do you see the prospects shaking out from a
market expansion standpoint currently?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Stephen, I think I might go at it the other way. So we don't have specifically market extensions baked into
the forecast. But when you start compartmentalizing that growth, you get growth from new hires and you get
growth from existing bankers and the footprint. And so, that's where that mid-teen growth would come from is that
math, the people that we have hired and the people that are sort of legacy lenders here.
In terms of market extensions, I think it is a good question. We've tried to – it comes up, Stephen, as you know,
there's always question about M&A, and so I always try to say, look, man, our opportunity in the markets that
we're in is so strong, it's hard to figure out. It has to be an overwhelming transaction for M&A. Same thing for
market extensions, I think we will have more market extension opportunities. We have had discussions in a
number of markets.
And just to remind you, for us, it's not about hiring a sales team, it's about hiring somebody we think can build a
big bank in that market. And so, when we plan those, we'll move. And so, when you think about where might we
move, Stephen, basically we keep going back to this triangle. If you go to Memphis and draw a line up to D.C. and
down to the state of Florida, the big, major urban markets are the markets we'd like to be in. And so as we find
people, we think those big bank will pull the trigger at that point. But that's not included in sort of the growth
projection.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 19-Apr-2022
Okay. Perfect. Yeah, that's really helpful. I probably should have said economic expansion, not margin expansion,
but that's a great answer, Terry, appreciate that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
And then if I'm thinking about BHG, the Atlanta expansion, I think that was noted in the presentation. Was that
about any extension of their product set, or is that just more about being able to tap a new market for talent to run
that platform?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I think it's a little both. I think a lot of the people that are part of some of their new products are in Atlanta. And so
they decided to establish kind of a foothold there in Atlanta. And I think that gives them opportunities to introduce
their brand through some more potential employees that have the talents that they're looking for.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. That's helpful. And then just one more question maybe around BHG and kind of credit outlook as a whole. I
know you said some of the stuff could change in the back half of the year. But with BHG, how do you combat
maybe some of the investor pushback that just says, hey, this is more unsecured consumer type of lending, this is
what we might be worried about if we are in a recession? How do you maybe combat that sort of ideology as you
think about that book and their business? And then if the Moody's modeling were to start to shift, would that also
have an impact on near term where your provisioning could go?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think, obviously if Moody's were to change their position on where they think GDP and unemployment
goes, that could be impactful to everybody. As to BHG and their credit systems and their borrowers, now granted
they've kind of gotten into the shallow end of the pool on point of sale, but as far as their traditional business lines,
they're lending to consumers at an average ticket sales of $50,000. So these are not low ticket kind of credits.
These are credits that are established. They believe in their credit scoring system. And so these are folks that
have legitimate credit histories that they can lean into with confidence.
So, I wouldn't classify it as traditional consumer book based on what I understand traditional consumer books look
like. These are folks that are focused on different things with respect to use of proceeds, so on and so forth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it, makes sense. Well, congrats on a great quarter, guys. And appreciate a lot of the new slides in the deck.
Very helpful stuff.

Operator: Our next question comes from Catherine Mealor with KBW.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Hi, Catherine.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
One follow-up on just the balance sheet and the margins, the cash is sitting at 14% of average earning assets
today. How do you think about where that ratio moves to through the back half of the year and how that goes into
your GAAP NII guide?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, we do have some reduction in that, but not a lot. We think it's going to be fairly stable for the rest of
the year. We are looking at a couple of near-term products that will give us some exposure on the shorter end of
the curve with some floating rate kind of instruments. That will maybe give us a little bit of an extra little punch. But
for all intents and purposes, that will be just another cash item that's making a little more money. I think
technically, it will be in the bond book, but it will be a short-term security.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then just a picture on credit, I mean, credit is till good, and you were just seeing charge-offs low
and NPAs decline and reserves are still coming down. I feel that there's a big disconnect between what we're
seeing from the banks and just concerns that we have with investors on Wall Street. Any commentary on what
you can do today to prepare for any potential increase in credit costs, types of credits you're looking more closely
at or you're staying away from parts of your book that you think are at relatively higher risk today, and things you
can do to prepare yourself would be helpful. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, like I mentioned before, I spent a lot of time with the credit officers, particularly the Chief Credit Officer, on
what kind of diligence they're about doing today, given what forecast looks like regarding inflation and so on and
so forth. We got a – and I think one of the things that gave me some comfort from what Tim was talking about to
me is that, they're going back into that COVID book that we looked at over the last two years, revisiting those
credits, particularly around hotels, because probably the first exposure will be to discretionary spending, so on
and so forth.

And right now, they believe that our client selection processes are sound, that we feel good that those type credits
that are more subject to discretionary spending are looked to be in good shape. Now, past that, then you look at
all the fuel consumers, call it truckers and concrete companies and [indiscernible] (01:07:30), and right now all of
them are passing that cost along. How long that's going to be able to do that, not sure. But right now, everybody is
up to their neck in business opportunities. The biggest issue like we talked about is, can they find workers.

Operator: Okay. I'll move on to the next one. Our next question comes from Brian Martin with Janney
Montgomery Scott.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey, good morning, guys. Hey, Harold, maybe I joined a little bit late, but just maybe the last question, you talked
a little bit about the liquidity. It sounded as the last quarter you kind of expected that liquidity to drop a little bit in
conjunction with the loan growth. Is your stance a little bit different this quarter based on just your comments to
last question or so that maybe it's not going to change all that much?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think it'll come down, but I don't think it's going to change a lot. Catherine noted 14%, it might go to 12%,
something like that. I don't think it's going to jump, it'll go down that much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. All right. And then just if you gave it Harold, maybe I missed it, just the timing of your rate increase
expectations. You said 50 basis points next meeting in May. Beyond that, is it just kind of one day meeting or
what?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think that's right, Brian.

Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. All right. And then just the deals on new loans that you guys were getting, I know you talked about spreads.
But just new loan yields today on the commercial side in general, can you give any thoughts on those relative to
what's coming off the books, right now on the books?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, I don't think there's a whole lot of big delta between the new loans and the former loans. Right now, we're
hopeful that we can get some increased rates on the fixed rate credit. I think we've been kind of – I don't know, we
just need to probably do a little better on fixed rate lending and what kind of rates we're getting on those. But other
than that, I think our spreads are hanging in there. There are other issues that's out there that our folks I think are
doing a really good job on is this whole LIBOR cessation thing. I think our rates that we're gathering on
[indiscernible] (01:10:08) that the spreads are hanging there, it's not increasing a little bit. So we feel pretty good
about that.
