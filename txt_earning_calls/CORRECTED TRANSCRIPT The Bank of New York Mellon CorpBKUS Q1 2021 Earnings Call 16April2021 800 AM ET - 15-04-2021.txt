Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Thank you, Magda, and good morning, everyone. I will touch on a few financial performance highlights and some
other business developments and hand it over to Emily to review the results in more detail. But, first, I wanted to
spend a minute discussing the environment in which we're all operating.
As I reflect on the past year, the word that keeps coming to mind for me is resilience, the resilience of our
business model, our global financial infrastructure and, of course, our clients and our employees. Indeed, we saw
the resilience of the financial system itself due to the lessons learned from the previous financial crises and to the
quick and decisive action from the government and regulators. And now, we're moving from a period of resilience
to a period that we are all optimistic, will be one of recovery and growth.
While we all remain clear-eyed about the challenges that still exist, I'm one of many business leaders who have
seen many reasons to be positive in the period ahead when we move pass the COVID cloud. The optimism stems
from the confluence of several factors, including the deployment of the vaccine, potential strength from
consumers.
Now, in the US, households have been saving at extraordinary levels. Currently, the savings rate is running about
14%, and that's more than twice the 30-year average. The amount held in cash in household and available for
spending is around 15% of GDP, which is way above normal times. In addition, monetary stimulus and further US
government spending plans are likely to accelerate GDP growth. So we expect significant GDP growth going

forward, assuming the pandemic is managed as expected. The strong economy is likely to keep activity and asset
levels high, and expectations for stronger growth is beginning to be reflected in the steepening of the curve.
Now, I also wanted to touch on the future of work and general productivity. The pandemic has driven remarkable
levels of innovation and technology adoption and companies have now become accustomed to the new way of
working. We've proven our ability to maintain high-quality service for our clients, adopt and deploy new
technologies quickly. We've collaborated with one another virtually over this past year. We're going to take the
best of what we've learned to continue to innovate and drive enhanced value for our clients and our employees,
including assessing what our workforce and workplaces will look like. We intend to embrace hybrid working
arrangements. We define future of work that continues to position us as an employer of choice in our industry.
Now with that, let me turn to some highlights on our performance, where we see momentum across our
businesses. Starting on slide 2, we reported revenue of $3.9 billion. Fee revenue, excluding the impact of money
market fee waivers, increased 6% year-over-year against the prior year quarter that had exceptional pandemic-
related volume and volatility.
Asset Servicing and Pershing, particularly, benefited from healthy client activity as well as market appreciation.
Operating margin of 29% is relatively flat year-over-year, not bad considering the significant loss in interest rate
revenue. We had a credit provision release of $83 million. EPS of $0.97 was down $0.08 from last year and return
on tangible common equity of 16%.
Turning to our businesses now, the strength in Asset Servicing revenue reflects higher markets, robust client
volumes and continued new business momentum. Our open architecture strategy and platforms continue to gain
traction with clients, powered by our data and analytics solutions.
In the first quarter, a large global asset manager in acquisition mode signed a multi-year agreement for Data
Vault, that's our cloud-based platform. The Vault allow their clients to integrate acquisitions quickly and easily
interact with data to gain actionable insights to help drive their business decisions.
We are proud to have been selected by Gabelli Funds to launch its new actively managed ETF and that's an
ESG-themed product, and to have been named ETF service provider for First Trust SkyBridge's Bitcoin ETF
Trust. In the first quarter, our ETF Servicing platform launched a record [ph] 51 funds (00:06:09) and our ETF
assets under custody and/or administration has now surpassed $1 trillion.
We recently also announced the establishment of a new Digital Assets unit, which is building a multi-asset
platform that will allow us to custody traditional as well as digital assets, including cryptocurrencies in an
integrated way. The growing client demand for digital assets and improved regulatory clarity presents an
opportunity for us to extend our current service offerings over time to this emerging field.
Moving to Pershing and Clearing and Collateral Management, Pershing benefited from continued elevated
transaction volumes, equity market strength and strong underlying fundamentals. As I mentioned last quarter, we
did lose a couple of clients due to consolidation and this together with the low rate environment, will impact
Pershing in 2021 and mask the underlying good organic fee growth.
In Clearing and Collateral Management, clearing fees remain strong and we expect healthy activity going forward.
Within Collateral Management, international fees were buoyant due to new business wins. In addition, as we
announced earlier this week, we now accept Chinese bond as collateral on our triparty platform through Hong
Kong's Bond Connect.

With the Chinese fixed income market only expected to grow, demand has been mounting for such a solution,
which until now has not existed. This is another example of BNY Mellon's continued innovation to drive value to
our clients.
Now, turning to Investment and Wealth Management, we recently announced the realignment of Mellon's
capabilities in fixed income, equity and multi-asset and liquidity management with Insight, Newton and Dreyfus
Cash, respectively. This will enhance the scale and capabilities of our specialist firms, and strengthen their
research platforms, operations as well as global reach. We had a year of consistent quarterly long-term inflows
and investment performance across our top strategies continues to be strong.
In Wealth Management, higher markets helped to drive client assets to a record level of almost $300 billion.
We've implemented many positive changes in this business, including new sales teams, a broader investment
and banking offering, and new digital capabilities for clients.
We were gratified by very high satisfaction stores in our year-end client survey, with all survey categories up year-
over-year. Now, our proprietary goals-based planning tool AdvicePath was recently named a CIO 100 Award
winner. This award recognizes 100 technology teams across industries that are driving growth through digital
transformation. So, a lot has been happening to build momentum for growth with existing and new clients.
Moving beyond financial performance, I want to spend a minute on ESG, something that is top of mind for our
investors, employees and our clients. We are committed to ensuring that we use our reach, market influence and
resources to address pressing ESG issues. Our goals include offering our clients leading analytical solutions,
empowering ESG investors with new investment strategies, and encouraging and enabling ESG financing.
Last month, we published our first report on how we're managing the impacts of climate change on our business,
prepared in accordance with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, or TCFD guidelines. I
encourage you to read it, as it includes examples of where we have initiatives in place related to climate risks and
opportunities and laid down multi-year metrics and targets, including plans to enhance disclosure around how
we're doing our part to healthy environment.
Now let me close with where I opened. The year started with continued extraordinary efforts by the US
government and Federal Reserve to address the economic fallout of the pandemic through fiscal and monetary
stimulus. Much uncertainty remains, but equity markets have been generally optimistic, although somewhat
volatile, and longer-term treasury yields have steepened, but the amount of liquidity in the system and inflows into
money market funds have driven short-term rates lower, in some cases, even negative.
So there are many positive factors that support our business model, but short-term rates continue to be a
challenge. Our business has proven to be resilient and we're well poised for organic growth. Moreover, we
continue to bring innovative solutions to the market to help our clients to help them grow.
With that, I'll hand it over to Emily to review our results in more detail.

Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. I will walk you through the details of our results for the quarter. All
comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis, unless I specify otherwise.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Beginning on page 3 of the financial highlights document, in the first quarter of 2021, we reported revenue of $3.9
billion and EPS of $0.97. This includes the impact of the reserve release of about $0.08 per share, partially offset
by a $39 million renewable energy investment impairment of about $0.04 per share.
Revenue was down 5% and EPS was down 8%. As expected, results were negatively impacted by continued low
interest rates and associated money market fee waivers and the absence of share repurchase activity for most of
2020.
Fee revenue, excluding fee waivers, grew 6%, driven by market levels, good organic growth and the positive
impact of a weaker US dollar. While client activity was down slightly versus the exceptional COVID-driven
volumes and balances experienced a year ago, it was stronger than we had anticipated.
As a reminder, last quarter, we guided to about 1.5% organic growth for the year. In this quarter, organic growth
was greater than 2%. Beginning this quarter, we reclassified a few revenue line items, which drives cleaner and
simpler reporting.
Basically, we took investment and other income out of our fee revenue and created a new reporting line which
includes investment and other income as well as other trading, variable interest entities, and securities gains and
losses. The reclassifications had no impact on total revenue and the details can be found on pages 19 and 20 of
the financial supplement. Prior periods have also been reclassified.
Foreign exchange revenue had a strong quarter, up 24% versus the fourth quarter, primarily on the back of high
volumes, and was 6% lower versus an exceptional prior year. Net interest revenue was down 20%.
Expenses increased 5% year-over-year, which was a bit higher than prior guidance due to higher revenue-related
expenses, higher litigation costs and the appreciation of our stock price associated with equity awards. As
previously disclosed, first quarter of 2020 also benefited from an accrual adjustment that was not repeated in
2021.
Provision for credit losses was a release of $83 million, primarily reflecting an improved macro outlook and CRE
price index. We had net recoveries of $1 million, and our portfolio remains high quality with approximately 85% of
loans rated investment grade at March 31.
Pre-tax margin of 29% was relatively flat to last year, which is a strong outcome considering the impact of the low
interest rate environment on fee waivers and NIR, both of which have de minimis expenses associated with them.
ROE was 8.5% and ROTCE was 16.1%.
Page 4 sets out a trend analysis of the main drivers of the quarterly results and is adjusted for notable items for
the fourth quarter of 2020 where indicated. Investment Services revenue was $3 billion, down 8% year-on-year.
The decline was primarily a result of lower net interest revenue, fee waivers and lower FX revenue. These
headwinds [ph] map (00:14:36) benefits from higher client volumes, liquidity balances, market levels and a
weaker US dollar. Investment Services fee and other revenue, ex-waivers, was up 2%.
Investment and Wealth Management revenue increased 10% as higher market value, modest equity investment
gains compared to losses a year ago, and a weaker US dollar offset the impact from fee waivers. Money market
fee waivers, net of distribution and servicing expense, were $188 million in the quarter compared to the $175
million guidance that we've provided previously. The higher than expected waivers were driven by higher
balances.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Turning to page 5, our capital and liquidity ratios remained strong and well above internal targets and regulatory
minimums. Common Equity Tier 1 capital totaled about $21.1 billion as of March 31, and our CET1 ratio was
12.6% under both the advanced and standardized approaches. Tier 1 leverage was 5.8%, down 50 basis points
from the fourth quarter, primarily due to high deposits. We continue to monitor the impact of liquidity in the system
on our balance sheet. We will continue to support our clients' cash management needs, while at the same time
managing our Tier 1 leverage ratio, which is our binding constraint.
Over the last year, excess deposits have grown substantially. Taking the unprecedented environment into
consideration, we are comfortable utilizing a portion of our internal buffer that we maintain for the Tier 1 leverage
ratio and, therefore, could go below 5.5% for a period of time. Finally, our LCR was flat compared to the fourth
quarter at 110%.
In terms of shareholder capital returns, we purchased $699 million of common stock in the first quarter, in line with
the Federal Reserve's modified limitations that apply to all CCAR banks, and continue to pay our $0.31 quarterly
dividend, which totaled $277 million this past quarter.
Turning to page 6, my comments on net interest revenue will highlight sequential changes. Q1 net interest
revenue was down 3.7%, with about two-thirds of the decline driven by the impact of lower interest rates and the
other one-third driven by other items such as day count and hedging activity. As a reminder, although average
deposits increased again this quarter, they had minimal NIR value in the current low short-term rate environment.
Turning to page 7, which summarizes deposits and securities trends. As mentioned, deposit balances continued
to grow and, on average, were up $21 billion or 7% from the fourth quarter and up $70 billion or 27% from a year
ago. As was the case in the fourth quarter, again, in Q1, a larger driver of the growth was excess liquidity in the
system driven by monetary and fiscal stimulus.
Turning to the securities portfolio, on average, the portfolio was flat to the fourth quarter and up approximately $26
billion, or 20%, over the prior year. Within the securities portfolio, we do continue to invest in non-HQLA
securities, primarily in non-agent CMBS, munis and investment-grade corporate bonds as we look to improve
yield while maintaining our conservative risk profile. We also continue to grow the loan portfolio opportunistically,
such as in 40 Act lending and other margin lending as well as capital call financing. Page 8 provides an overview
on expenses, which we largely covered earlier.
Turning to page 9, as mentioned earlier, total Investment Services revenue year-on-year declined by 8% due to
the impact of low interest rates on NIR and fee waivers, and lower FX compared to the strong year-ago quarter.
NIR was down 20%. Fee and other revenue, ex-waivers, was up 2%. FX revenue in Investment Services had a
strong quarter, up 18% from the fourth quarter and down 15% year-over-year as higher client volumes partially
offset normalization of spreads and volatility.
Assets under custody and/or administration increased 18% year-over-year to $41.7 trillion on the back of higher
market values and client inflows, the favorable impact of weaker US dollar and net new business.
As I move to the business line discussion, I'm going to focus my comments on fees. Asset Servicing fees were up
slightly, excluding fee waivers, primarily reflecting higher client activity and higher market levels, partially offset by
lower FX revenue to a comparably high period last year. The pipeline remains strong and win-loss ratios continue
to improve.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Pershing had another strong quarter despite the impact of fee waivers. While fees were down, they would have
been up excluding fee waivers. Year-over-year, clearing accounts were up 5%, mutual fund assets were up 24%,
and we saw continued strong net new asset flows of $28 billion in the quarter. Transactional activity remains
robust with average daily clearing revenue up about 30% from the fourth quarter, although we do expect this to
normalize as we move through 2021.
Issuer Services fees decreased, mostly driven by fee waivers and COVID-related dividend fee impact in DR.
Treasury Services fees were up modestly, ex-waivers, on the back of higher payment volumes and higher money
market fund balances and a continued shift to higher margin products.
Clearance and Collateral Management fees were down slightly, primarily due to elevated volume in the year-ago
quarter. Continued organic growth in our non-US business, where triparty balances and clearing fees increased,
was offset by slight declines in US volumes and lower intra-day financing fees.
Page 10 summarizes the key drivers that affect the year-over-year revenue comparisons for each of our
Investment Services businesses.
Turning to Investment and Wealth Management on page 11, as noted earlier, total Investment and Wealth
Management revenue in the quarter increased 10%. Overall, assets under management held steady compared to
the fourth quarter's record $2.2 trillion and were up 23% year-over-year, primarily due to higher market value, the
positive impact of a weaker US dollar and net inflows.
Investment Management revenue grew 13% in spite over 700 basis points negative impact from fee waivers as
the benefit of higher market levels, equity investment gains in the current quarter compared to losses a year ago,
and a weaker dollar more than offset lower performance fees against a strong year-ago quarter.
In the first quarter, we had net inflows of $36 billion, including our fourth straight quarter of long-term inflows of
$17 billion, driven by strong inflows in LDI and fixed income as well as index funds. Investment performance
remains strong with more than 80% of our top 30 strategies having peer rankings ranked in the top two quartiles
on a three-year basis, up from 73% a year ago.
Wealth Management revenues were up 5% on the back of higher market. Client assets grew to a record $292
billion and were up 24% year-over-year, primarily due to high market values and inflows. Non-mortgage loans and
client deposits are also up.
Now turning to the other segment on page 12, the year-over-year revenue comparison was primarily impacted by
the impairment of one renewable energy investment as noted earlier. The expense increase primarily reflected
incentive comp accrual reversals in the year ago quarter.
A few comments about the outlook. As we think about the balance of 2021, for NIR, our full year guidance
remains unchanged. This implies NIR on a full year basis will be down around 11% to 12% compared to 2020.
With regard to waivers using the forward curve to project, just like we do for NIR, we expect waivers, net of
distribution and servicing expense, to be around $220 million for the second quarter. This will have a modest
negative impact to revenues of approximately $20 million due to lower rates, partially offset by higher balances.
So, for the second half of the year, we do expect to be more in line with the first quarter.
With regards to fees, ex-waivers, the growth rate in the first quarter was significantly higher than previous full year
guidance due to higher volume, but we expect those volumes to moderate going forward. Regarding expenses,

we previously guided to be up about 1.5%, excluding notable items. Given the higher expenses this quarter, we
now expect them to be up about 2%. As a reminder, on a constant currency basis, we guided that we will be flat
year-on-year, and that will now be up about 50 basis points.
Finally, in terms of our effective tax rate, we still expect it to be approximately 19% for 2021. However, we are
monitoring the latest federal tax proposal closely. In terms of shareholder capital returns, we will continue to pay
our quarterly dividend and will once again make open market share repurchases in compliance with the Federal
Reserve's modified limitations, which will allow us to repurchase approximately $600 million of common stock in
the second quarter.
Looking beyond the second quarter, the Federal Reserve's latest communication to CCAR banks indicated that
they will likely implement the SCB framework for capital management in the third quarter, so we are following that
guidance closely. We look forward to receiving the results of this year's stress test and operating under the stress
capital buffer framework, which will allow for more flexibility and should mean that we can return more than 100%
of earnings to shareholders starting in the third quarter.
With that, operator, can you please open up the line for questions?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Of course. Thank you. [Operator Instruction] And our first question comes from the line of Brennan
Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping to ask actually, Emily, about some of those
comments on capital and Fed returning to the SCB approach which allows for capital returns. The Tier 1 leverage
ratio is now inside your guided band with a buffer of 5.5% to 6%, I believe. You all have referenced that you have
leverage to pull, which might help on that front. So could you maybe walk us through some of those dynamics?
And then also, how rigid is that buffer that you've applied? It seems to be a bit above peers. And so would you –
or are you in a position where you could allow yourselves to go underneath that buffer for a period of time given
the unusual growth in deposits?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. Thanks for the question. So we are very – managing our deposits very closely. Having said that, we will
absolutely continue to support our clients with our balance sheet, and we're comfortable with where deposits are
now. But of course, it goes without saying, over the course of the last 12 months, there have been a lot of
additional reserves in the system, liquidity in the system, and so we've seen a surge in those deposits. A large
portion of that surge is excess, so it's non-operational.
We've been very successfully working with our clients to basically explore and move some of those non-
operational deposits to off-balance sheet vehicles. Thankfully, we have a good platform in Liquidity Direct that has
lots of alternatives. That's an open platform. So that has been very effective.

You are correct in pointing out, as I did mention in my prepared remarks, that given the unprecedented liquidity in
the system, we would feel comfortable dipping into our Tier 1 leverage buffer. We do hold a very significant buffer,
in excess of 150 basis points over reg minimums. We size that very carefully. It's basically to both absorb any
impact to OCI given rate changes as well as also the – any surge in balances. And given that's really what we've
seen and the buffer is really there for this particular kind of unprecedented environment, ultimately, we would feel
comfortable dipping below the 5.5% for a period of time, of course, running certainly above the regulatory
minimum.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Right. Okay. That helps. That's great to hear. And then one other question on the balance sheet. It seemed as
though the interest-bearing asset growth lagged deposit growth this quarter on an average basis, right, just
looking at the [ph] average balance sheet (00:29:12). Was that because some of those deposits may be
temporary? Maybe you all were in the process of encouraging some folks to consider off-balance sheet options
like referenced, therefore, when we gauge balance sheet growth here this quarter, we should more pay attention
– which one should we pay attention to more? Which one is more indicative? Is it the interest-earning asset
growth? Or is it deposit growth? And – or is it just that you'll be putting more money to work, therefore, the
interest-earning asset growth will catch up? I just wasn't – it seemed a big gap, so I wasn't sure about that.
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. I mean, sure, so certainly – and I think I just mentioned, a significant portion of the deposit growth that
we've seen, we do think is excess and so non-operational. So, it's very hard to really redeploy that into the
securities portfolio or the loan portfolio for any real duration. So, as a result, a lot of that is just sitting at the Fed
earning 10 basis points, which obviously is dilutive to NIM, but, of course, it is overall accretive to NIR, just
obviously marginally so.
So when we think about just NIR in general, we really just use the forward curve to project. And despite, of
course, the steepening of the long end of the curve, we did see the short end grind lower. And also the duration of
the curve where we invest is more in the two- to five-year mark, and that didn't go up as much as the long end.
But, of course, to the extent the curve does continue to steepen and/or shift upwards, that will be extraordinarily
helpful.

Yes, Brian, we can hear you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Very good and thanks. Just one more on the rate sensitive and net interest revenue and fee waivers, just the
cadence as they move through the year really into second quarter. And back a little bit to that, deposit strategy
with the excess deposits, is there an ability to put a little bit more on the securities portfolio as we move into the
second quarter?
So what I'm trying to get at is, given your full year guidance, are we at sort of stability, as you see it coming into
the second quarter on NIR? Or is it maybe another dip down before we go up?
And then similar to that, on the fee waiver, I think you said $220 million for the second quarter, but then, I'm not
sure if I got this correct, that you thought that was going to improve in the back half and that was based on
balances. Can you clarify that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure...

Emily, you want to take that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. So, in terms of NIR, we don't really give ultimately quarter-by-quarter balances and so much of it is
dependent upon – or quarter-by-quarter projections and so much of it is dependent upon obviously the rate curve,
deposit levels and MBS prepayment and other factors, all of which are baked into our projections.
And what I would say, as I just reconfirmed, is that our full year projection for NIR is still the same as the original
guidance given which is 11% or 12% down year-on-year. So that hasn't changed fully.
In terms of waivers, so waivers are a function of two things, basically, short-term rates, specifically three months
and six months T-bills as well as repo rates. Also, a function of money market fund balances.
And actually what we saw this quarter is actually both rates grind lower, balances go higher. As a result, waivers
overall were a bit higher than originally anticipated at $188 million. They were – that – the total impact, however,
was slightly positive to revenues.
And again, just we use the forward curve to also project waivers. Looking at the forward curve, also the historical
relationship between rates and money market balances, et cetera, we think that waivers – the size of waivers
overall will peak in the second quarter at about $220 million. And then, by the way that would be probably, at the
fees we're talking about, the gross yields we're talking about, probably slightly negative to revenues. But then we
would expect the second half of the year to be more in line with the first quarter.

And look, I always like to remind people, albeit it's probably not until the latter half of 2022 or 2023 that if – when
Fed funds eventually hit 25 is when the Fed moves, we will recover in excess of 50% of those waivers. And when
it hit the 1%, it's very close to 100% of those waivers.

Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Definitely, that's a good color. And then the second question is on organic growth. You said it did tick up to 2%
this quarter. Maybe if you could just talk about the drivers of that. I know, Todd, you mentioned very good demand
for data analytics with the Data Vault. It sounds like that contract is not in. The big one you mentioned is not in the
run rate yet. But maybe if you could just talk about that momentum and the organic growth rate and drivers of
that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. So thanks for the question, Brian. So the first quarter, we got the benefit, obviously, of a lot of activity. Hard
to project exactly where that activity is going to go. But the guidance, I think, that Emily provided to you is
probably not sustainable at this level. But we did get some nice new wins, which is reflected in that.
Pershing volumes were particularly high, very good flows in a number of their accounts. So, we're seeing a lot of
good growth with existing clients as well with balances there. We do expect them, as I said, to moderate
somewhat.
And I also did point out that – on the previous call that we had some lost business in Pershing that will impact us
later this year. So, Pershing has got pretty strong underlying organic growth to it, but it's going to be masked a bit
by both the interest rates as well as that lost business that will impact in the second half.
But we are seeing sustained momentum across just about all of our business, strong pipelines. And so, as we
converted the pipeline to sales, we continue to build the pipeline. We have another pretty big quarter for sales.
Our higher win-loss ratios are improving and retention has continued to be good.
I mentioned the Data Vault, and we had a number of clients in beta. We've now signed a very significant one and
building a deeper relationship with that client, a lot of interest in some of our analytics and our applications that
we've described to before.
We're actually seeing recovery in payment flows, too. So Treasury Services, which is largely commercial
payments and lot of it's global, we're seeing a good recovery back on economic recovery. And we're also picking
up some market share. We've got some pretty interesting opportunities there. As we look forward, we're pretty
excited what we might be able to do in the real-time payments space there.
Asset/Wealth Management had positive flows. We're seeing meaningful improvement in Wealth. And we've been
talking about the investments that we're making across the businesses, both – even in the core custody, our
middle office functions, the payment system.
Clearing and Collateral Management [indiscernible] (00:37:38) it was off of an extraordinary good quarter last
year, but we continue to pick up global assets. The fact that we've built up this Bond Connect capability in China
is an exciting innovative service that we're providing to clients. And we're confident that, that's going to continue to
grow. So, good underlying momentum helped by very strong activity in the first quarter.

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. A couple of questions. A little bit on the technical side, on the build-out that you're doing around the digital
assets, the cryptocurrencies and that kind of thing. Could you remind us the kind of pace that you're anticipating
being able to roll this out? And are you going to be custodying the physicals? Just wanted to understand what the
– how wide the aperture is on this opportunity set.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Okay. Sure, Betsy. I'll take it. It's Todd. So, when we talk about our digital asset efforts, what we're talking about is
digitizing traditional securities, so that they're more easily mobilized, things like you can digitize the money market
fund, make it an eligible asset to put into repo, which you couldn't do in the past, and you can make it much, much
more efficient. We think there's going to be quite a bit of that activity as well as smart contracts and what that
might be able to do for the corporate trust and other businesses. So that's one element of it.
The other thing that we're going to see is we think there will be digitization of fiat currencies. We're already
involved in a consortium with Fnality, which is a central bank currency, which could trade 24/7 in digital form and
is really just developing regulatory approvals for it now. So we do think there will be – and there are already
existing digital currencies, fiat currencies.
And where every – the thing that gets the hype is really around the cryptocurrencies that we would be digitizing –
excuse me, we would be custodizing those as well. So, we have been working on a prototype. And we expect to

be offering capabilities across all three of those by the end of the year as we're building things out with clients that
have shown institutional interest.
So, yes, we would actually have the wallet, if you will, or be the custodian for the underlying cryptocurrency or
anyone of those particularly digitized assets.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. So you would actually be custodying the physicals, you're not going to be sub-custodying that out to
somebody else?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
That is not our intent at this point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q

And then what's the timeframe for getting to market? Is that a 2021 or 2022 timeframe?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
We expect that you'll be hearing some things towards the end of 2021, but it may be a little bit earlier for some
elements of it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then the other theme I wanted to just touch base on was around the climate comment that you had in
your prepared remarks, Todd. I mean, part of it is asking the question, what can you do? Is this about your own
footprint, or is this also about working with your clients? And if it's working with your clients, how do you anticipate
you will help them get more climate-friendly, so to speak?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yes. So there's really two elements to it, Betsy. One is what we're doing as an enterprise, our own carbon
footprint, for example. And we've been very active. We published recently – in February, we published a
Considering Climate at BNY Mellon report, which gave very specific examples of what we've done around carbon,
waste and other environmental-related activities. And we are carbon-neutral. We have been for an extended
period of time.
And we've been named by the CDP, really, one of five financial institutions that have been given an A rating on
climate. And we're the only financial institution that have gotten that rating over the past eight years. So that's
what we're doing as a firm in managing paper and our carbon footprint. In terms of – what we're also doing is
we're providing services to clients. For example, we're the largest trustee on green bonds and we can certainly
help clients establish the trustee function that goes along with that.

But in addition, in the Asset Servicing space, one of the things that have come out of our data and analytics
capability is a very interesting application on ESG and allowing our clients to customize [ph] their views (00:43:26)
of their own portfolios. And we use a crowdsourcing technique that's unique. And we offer a cloud-based solution.
The client basically brings the license from [ph] their (00:43:41) data providers. We're connected to 100 data
providers. We got 2.5 million securities in that application. And there's kind of a constant feedback loop to the data
providers. So they're constantly enhancing the amount of information that they might have on a particular security.
So we're excited about that. We have quite a few clients on it now, and we're just contracting them for permanent
usage.
And in addition to that, in our Investment Management space, we're building quite a few ESG products. And in the
Servicing space, we were just awarded an attractive ETF that was based on ESG. So it really goes in those two
forms. One is the commercial element that we can help our businesses. And number two is just doing the right
thing for our own company.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning, Todd and Emily. Hope you guys are doing well? Maybe another question around capital. So I
heard you guys obviously targeting over 100% payout. That's something that you guys have targeted for a little
while as well. Can you help us kind of calibrate that against the significant buyback you have authorized
currently?
Obviously, there could be some probably technical restrictions [ph] in terms of how much (00:45:14) you could
ultimately get done in the third quarter given just the volume threshold. But maybe help us think through that
relative to your comments and willingness to kind of go below the 5.5% Tier 1 leverage. So I'm just kind of trying
to think through how much you could ultimately get done.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. So, ultimately, you are correct in mentioning that we had approval. I'll just remind folks, the board approval
was given in the fourth quarter of last year to do buybacks up to $4.4 billion through the third quarter of this year.
Given the Fed's limitations on buybacks actually through the second quarter, it's probably going to be pretty
unlikely that we could execute the entirety of $4.4 billion, just literally in terms of ADB, et cetera. But we will do as
much as we are allowed.
And assuming that the Fed does return to or implement, I should say, the SCB framework, which does allow for
much more flexibility, we would intend to certainly execute in excess of 100% of – or return, I should say, in

excess of 100% of earnings in the third quarter as much as we could do. And anything that we couldn't do, we
would hope to catch up in the fourth quarter in that program.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe we can unpack some of the NIR dynamics a little bit more. So, two
questions there. I guess, one, deposit costs, I think were roughly flattish, I guess, sequentially just in terms of
what you guys are targeting. Is there room for that to grind a little bit lower as you're trying to optimize the balance
sheet? Or there's not a whole lot you guys could do in terms of pushing pricing on deposits to clients?
And then I wanted to clarify your comments around premium amortization. I don't know if I missed it, but what was
it in the quarter? And your full year NIR guidance, what does that assume for premium am for the rest of the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. So just talking about, first, deposits. You are right that the deposit rates are relatively flat. And remember,
that's an average across non-US dollar as well as US dollar. We are charging in, for example, euros and for
Japanese yen, we're not, of course, charging for the US – in the US. I mean, look, there – I don't know if this is
the trough, but this is probably pretty much close to, ultimately, I guess, the rate that we get to. Of course, if rates
actually went negative in the US, we could start charging for deposits. We certainly don't feel or having felt that,
that is necessary. And ironically, if you do start charging for deposits, then you start to earn money, earn more in
NIR. So – but that isn't the intention at the moment.
In terms of your second...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Hey, Emily, let me just add something to that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure, sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So I think in the Fed guidance, Alex, that they've provided, they really have talked about there being means for
them to limit any possibility of negative rates for any sustainable time. And we've seen repo rates go negative a
little bit. So we do think that there are probably policy actions if that were to dip down. But as we go through the –
as we scrub through the nature of the deposits that we've gotten, and obviously there's very limited value to them
now, we've got a whole capital against them now. We are grinding them down, but there's not a whole lot more to
grind down.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Yeah. And then premium...

Oh, sure, [ph] on AM. (00:49:04) On the MBS prepayment speeds, just in our NIR projections, we've already
taken into account a trajectory of MBS prepayments slowing down just based upon the rise in rates. So just to
think about it in terms of sizing, we would expect the MBS prepayment speeds to slow down by about probably
15% to 20% by year end.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. You had some good fee growth in Servicing that you talked about healthy volumes that should moderate. Is
that kind of expectations around Pershing? And what are you seeing Pershing or retail behavior? You have a
window into that world, [ph] I guess (00:50:02)?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah, Mike, I'll take that. So, I'd say it's a – so I think it's a combination of things. So we've seen a lot of activity in
the trading space. We have seen retail activity that was very high, as you know. And Pershing does see some of
that. But it's been in the institutional side as well as the retail side, and we would expect that to subside somewhat
from the elevated levels that we saw in the first quarter. What was interesting is the institutional business is
probably a little more active in March and the retail business was probably a little more active in January and
February.

cash sloshing around the system and it's got to go somewhere. One of the things that I pointed out, the savings
rate doubled the national average. We've got 15% – households are holding 15% of GDP in cash. They're either
going to spend it, invest it or just let it lose value sitting in cash. So, our guess is that we're probably going to see
lower activity, but it's – my guess is as good as yours.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then just one last question on the fee waivers. I mean, your customers must love you. I mean, can –
this is, I mean, this is – $220 million of fee waivers in the second quarter coming up. I mean, hopefully, you're
building some long-term goodwill, but shareholders don't benefit from that. So, I mean, you said you're not going
to charge for deposits or – I mean what – any other options there? Or just – you just have to eat it and hope you
get long-term goodwill?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
So, Mike, what I...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
[indiscernible] (00:52:16) Let me start, Emily, and you can follow up on it. So a lot of the excess balances is
ending up in cash or even ending up in money market funds. So we continue to see this cash build. So even
though it's $220 million of fee waivers, a lot of that's just driven by excess balances that we don't think are going
to be there when interest rates recover, just like we think the excess reserves in the system will obviously
contract.
That being said, we do think it provides a lot of upside when the market turns around, which we've reflected the
last time we went through this cycle. And we can earn a little bit on it still. And a little bit of good news is that the
Fedspeak recently has been pointing to the possibility to firm things up on the short-end of the curve. We've
actually seen the forward rates kind of improve a little bit recently. So we're making the assumption that using the
forward curve from a few days ago when we gave that guidance, that fee waivers will be [ph] active by (00:53:36)
like they did during the first quarter.
That being said, it is a significant hit to earnings. We think we'll recover it. We still ran a 29% operating margin
even with that environment. And the other thing that we've done is between NIR and fee waivers, we think we are
now at or very close to the trough and it can obviously worsen its interest rates even got a little bit lower, but we
think we are close to the trough and so the business model is now going to start to grow off of this level.

The only thing I just – Mike, the only thing I just want to add to that is just remember that a large portion of those
waivers are really just funds that we distribute. So, it's where the kind of the recipient of just lower fees versus
competitive waivers that we're actually offering in Asset Management.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning. Just had a follow-up on the Asset Services fee line, it was nice to see the 5%
improvement sequentially. And I just wondered last quarter, you had mentioned some of the bulkier repricing and
kind of one-time things. This quarter, you mentioned that there's a little bit of elevated activity.
Just wondering from like an outlook perspective, anything we should know just about kind of the trajectory of
onboarding new wins. And are we kind of – do we have a clear line of sight on any expected meaningful repricing
this year? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Emily, do you want to take it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. So, we did see a nice uptake in terms of Asset Servicing fees. They were up 5% actually sequentially. And
just 50% of that is due to asset levels. And the remaining 50% is based on transaction volumes. And transaction
volumes across Asset Servicing, all of our businesses in Asset Servicing, was up significantly, double-digits in
some cases, quarter-on-quarter.
As Todd alluded to, we do expect that volume to moderate a bit in the second half. Having said that, we also feel
that there's very strong fundamentals across the business. Our pipeline is strong. The average sized deals in the
pipeline are bigger. Retention stats are very strong. And we're also making significant investments in the business
that are resonating with clients.
In terms of the repricing, there's nothing really structural that we observe. The repricing that we did experience
last quarter that was a bit lumpy was really totally tied to just a few large clients that happen to be going RFP at
the same time.
It's always been a pretty modest headwind for the business that we've been able to offset with new business,
retention, growth with our existing clients, and further efficiency.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got it. Thanks for that, Emily. And then just one more balance sheet question, in terms of Fed accommodation,
the incremental deposits that flowed in and certainly seemed to land on your balance sheet. How are you just
anticipating changes as we go forward with potential ends to QE? And how do you think your balance sheet
would act versus the more traditional regional banks in terms of the retention of the deposits that have flowed in?
Thank you.

Thomas P. Gibbons A

Do you want to take it, Emily?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. So ultimately, we think when – we basically – as the Fed increases reserves, we think roughly about 2% or
so ends up on our balance sheet. It's actually hard to tell and depend very much on the economic backdrop.
As I did mention, we do think a large portion of the deposits that we've seen and the growth in those deposits
especially in the last two quarters is excess, so non-operating. And we do think that, that would recede pretty
quickly when interest rates start to normalize and monetary policy starts to normalize.
I don't know, Todd, if you have anything to add to that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. I think if you go back to pre the COVID event, which really led to the spike, we've seen something close to
$100 million of balance increases. Some of that was intentional as we built relationships and comes naturally with
the growth in our businesses. But a significant amount of that was, what we call, – will fit into that excess
definition. So, we'd imagine probably somewhere between $25 billion to $50 billion of that $100 billion increase
would roll off.

James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey, good morning. Maybe just if I think about your guidance on NII, it does seem like your – the implication is
that NII is sort of stabilizing here, and I assume that implies sort of securities yields are going to kind of hold in at
current levels. So if we kind of assume a static balance sheet going forward, I know that's not necessarily the right
way to think about it, but if we assume – try to isolate what could be the inflection point, what level of rates – I
mean, I think you've indicated the two to five years is important, you're not going to go further out than that. We've

had the five-year now at 83 basis points moving higher. Do we need to see that translate into the two to three
year? I mean what level of rate structure should we start to see maybe yields going the other way?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Why don't I start, Emily, and then you can add? So...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
...I think there are really two key elements to it, Jim. Number one is the short end of the curve. So, we've got a
significant number of assets that are pricing off of LIBOR or short-term indices. And once again, this quarter, we
saw, for example, one-month LIBOR was down 3 basis points from its average in the fourth quarter and 2 basis
points for three-month LIBOR.
So, we got a – that offset the benefit of the move on the longer part of the curve. But the steepening out to five
years, we keep the duration around 2.5 years, so that would mean there's going to be significant assets out there
that roll off and get reinvestment is helpful and it will slowly come into it, but it's basically been offset. That benefit
has been offset by what we saw in the short end of the curve.

James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
No, that makes sense. I was just trying to think through, assuming short rates are pretty stable from here, what
kind of gets – what at the longer end really starts to help you?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. I mean, 5 and 10 years, because what that does is it extends the duration of the mortgage-backed
securities, so their yields picked up because the amortization premium declines as stuff – and we're constantly
reinvesting. As stuff gets reinvested to maintain the duration that currently exists in the portfolio, it would go into
higher levels. So, it would be helpful here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
And Jim, we disclosed in the 10-Q just some sensitivities that might be helpful as well for you to size that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
No, no. I got it. I just was trying to get a sense of what level of rates in the middle of the curve would be helpful,
but we can always talk about that offline. Thanks.

Michael Anagnostakis Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Hey, good morning. This is Michael Anagnostakis on for Steven. Just following up on the NII guide and you gave
some detail around where you're deploying some of that excess liquidity from here. And I appreciate the color on
premium am as well. Maybe you could just provide some color around how much of that deployment is
contemplated in the NII guide for the securities portfolio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. So...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A

Emily, do you want to take that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. So, I mean, our securities portfolio is basically flat to last quarter. And we are marginally increasing our non-
HQLA within the quarter. But when I talked about the NIR guidance for the full year still being about 11% to 12%,
where the rate – it's just based on the forward curve, deposits basically remaining pretty much where they are, if
not, coming down a bit, and MBS prepayment speed slowing down. So those are the key assumptions.

Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Hi, Gerard.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Todd, can you frame out for us, when you think about your years at Bank of New York, the number of new
products that Bank of New York has introduced over the years, I think of like custody of non-traditional assets as
one. When you think about the opportunities for this digital – digitalization and the cryptocurrencies that you guys
are working on that you already talked about, how big can this be, and again, comparing it to other new ventures
that you've been involved with over the years at Bank of New York, if you could compare that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. I think it's early to tell. I mean, if you think of all the noise that Bitcoin got, so it's still only about 10% of gold.
And gold as a custodized asset is not that important, frankly, right? So, it's getting a lot of hype. I do think
decentralized finance is coming. I do think fintechs are going to be important players. And I do think that we can
position ourselves well and work with fintechs to build opportunities. I think you're going to see it in payments. I
think you are going to see it in custody. It's hard for me to say just how big of an opportunity that is at this point. It
will grow.
I think the more important thing is that we need to give investors choice and so if they do want to mobilize assets
faster, we need to be able to help them to do that. If they do want to be able to hold some non-traditional assets,
just as they went into alternatives and other things, we need to be able to help them to do that and in a way that is
– eliminates a lot of the counterparty risk that currently exists, which is high, and also enables them to get
reporting on a consolidated basis in valuations and so forth, which is also critically important.
And so there are a number of ETFs coming out that are crypto-related. There's obviously good underlying growth
on a very small base. We think it's an important part of the full product capability. How big it ultimately becomes, I
think it's just a little early for me to really speculate.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Yeah, I was just going to add one little thing, which is it's as much about retention as it also is about new
business. Our clients are demanding integrated capabilities across digital assets as well as traditional securities
and currencies.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Got it. Thank you. You guys have always told us, and you talked about it again today, the leverage ratio is the
binding constraint, not the CET1 ratio. You pointed out, Emily, that it may dip down below 5.5%, but still well
above the regulatory minimums. We understand that. At what point would the leverage ratio actually come into
play where you would have to back away from your buybacks?
Even though you have the CET1 ratio, not a problem, but at what point do you say we've got to slow it down
because the leverage ratio has fallen too far down? And then as part of that, is the leverage ratio really linked to
the QE, meaning the deposit growth? And should we get a tapering then we should get some relief on your
balance sheet growth, which maybe would help the leverage ratio as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Yeah. Let me start, Emily, and then you can add. If you think about it, we put a buffer on the leverage ratio for
business as usual, now this isn't for stress testing, but for business as usual. And that buffer really reflects the
potential for a spike in deposits or a decline due to – in other comprehensive income based on the mark-to-market
in the securities portfolio. And so frankly, Gerard, we've seen the spike in deposits. And could it go up a little bit
higher? Yeah, it may. But our view now is part of the reason for the buffer has already taken place.
And as I indicated on one of the earlier questions, we probably – when things start to normalize, we probably
have $50 billion of runoff in deposits. So that's an enormous amount, an enormous impact on that ratio. And also,
the [ph] coverage from the OCI that has to be (01:08:14) that high. So given the fact that we've already made this
spike, it makes sense for us to go ahead and dip into our buffers. And Emily said, going to a 5% probably is not
an unreasonable thing in this environment. If we were in an environment where we were a year ago, I'm not sure I
would say that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Emily H. Portney A
Chief Financial Officer, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
The only thing I might add is just – I mean, even if we were – like as Todd just said, we'd be comfortable going
towards 5%, but even there, if you're still – you would need a considerable increase in deposits there from where
we are today. So we've got plenty of room.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Rob Wildhack from Autonomous
Research. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Wildhack Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Good morning, guys. If we could go back to the cryptocurrency and digital assets space for a second, you're
clearly taking a few steps forward there with the announcements you made this quarter. Is that because you think
we've hit some kind of inflection point in that part of the market? Or is it just more of a natural evolution of your
service?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Rob, I would say it's more of a natural evolution. We're having deep discussions working with clients, the
institutional side. And we started to see this toward the end of last year and the beginning of this year that the
institutional side was getting more and more interested in digital assets. And so we started working with them for
solutions across a broad part of our business.

Brian Kleinhanzl Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks. Two questions here. One on the [ph] Asset Servicing here just an update (01:10:37) on how the
underlying pricing is with 50% for asset levels and 50% for transaction volumes. Where is – do you want to take
those percentages though longer term? Is that the mix that you're at and this would be steady state from here?
Are you trying to get more transaction volume base just as we think how pricing trends evolve here?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
So, I mean, the 50-50 split is just the nature of the beast and the nature of the business. So it's not like we are
trying to move that in any direction. And for pretty much years, that's just really the dynamics of how we're pricing
in Asset Servicing. About 50% of the revenue stream is based on asset levels and about 50% or so is based on
transaction costs. So it's pretty much the norm.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Kleinhanzl Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And second question, I mean, you look at Issuer Services and Treasury Services and the revenue drivers
both being impacted by interest rates above and beyond the money market fee waivers. Is there any way to
allocate what part of those revenues are kind of driven by interest rates as we think about asset sensitivity on a
go-forward basis? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas P. Gibbons A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
Sure. So both of those businesses are significant deposit-taking businesses or either we take them the on-
balance sheet or off-balance sheet through sweeps into money market funds. And so the interest rate impact, it's
a meaningful contribution to both of them. I don't think we've broken out exactly what the split is, but it – and it's a
meaningful contribution to the – obviously to the operating margins because there's no expense associated with
the NIR.
What we've seen in Treasury Services is an intentional build in deposits over the past year as we built out those
relationships. And it's very much related to the activity in the accounts, too, because there needs to be cash and
accounts to make payments. And there's some frictional cash that tends to come with that.
Money market fee waiver is a little less important there. But if you think about the Corporate Trust business, what
issuers will do is they'll put cash a day or two in advance of payments that need to be made on issues that we're
the trustee and the paying agent. And typically, that's value that – where we get a little of that value or we sweep it
into a money market fund. And so that's a meaningful contributor to that business. And that's where we're now
seeing the kind of the late stages impact of fee waivers, and that's why the Issuer Services business was down
sequentially and year-over-year.
