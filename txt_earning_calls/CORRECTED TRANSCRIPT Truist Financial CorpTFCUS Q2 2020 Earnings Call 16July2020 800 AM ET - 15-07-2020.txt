Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thanks, Ryan. Good morning, everybody. Thank you very much for joining our call, and I hope you and your
family are safe and well. Given the challenges that we face, I think this was a really strong quarter primarily
because we lived our purpose. And I'll say I'm really, really proud of our team. Our purpose is to inspire and build
better lives and communities, and that is really, really important in the challenging environment that we are
experiencing today.
And then we focus intensely on taking care of our clients. I've been really, really involved with our teammates,
creating an inclusive and energizing environment; really focusing on trying to empower our teammates to learn
and grow and have meaningful careers. And I think we've done a good job across the board with regard to all of
our stakeholders in optimizing their long-term returns. We did all that consistent with our values of trustworthy,

caring, one team, success, and ultimately trying to provide a sense of happiness for our teammates and all of the
people that we have a chance to inspire and support.
If you're following the presentation, on table 5, I just want to point out some of the things that we've done because
I think in today's world this is as important, if not, more important than the actual numbers because our
communities need a lot of help. We've been really focused on living our purpose. You've heard about our Truist
Cares philanthropic initiative where we've pledged $50 million to rebuild communities. Some of the things we do
and are really, really exciting, for example, we're doing technological support in areas that are unserved or
underserved with regard to Internet and Wi-Fi capabilities. We're using that to support automated reading
capabilities in these areas because these kids are sheltered in placed at home and don't have access easily to
learning.
We're supporting our communities, doing a lot of work with CDFIs in terms of supporting small businesses,
minority-owned businesses, women-owned businesses. Feel good about that. Just to give you a perspective; over
the last few years on our onUp Movement, we provided about 6 million people with tools to provide their financial
confidence. Since 2009, we've done over 12,000 community projects, we've touched over 18 million people
through our Financial Foundations program, which is focused on financial literacy. In high schools, we've reached
more than 1 million high school students. And since the merger of equals, a very short period of time, we've
provided $440 million in financing to support 2,200 affordable housing units, creating 1,400 new jobs across our
footprint.
We've been really focused on addressing racial and social inequity. We're expanding our efforts to advance
equity, economic empowerment and education for our clients, our communities, and our teammates. I'm very
proud to say, we observed Juneteenth holiday by giving our people time off. We had a virtual town hall with over
3,000 of our teammates that I was able to co-host along with Ben Crump, and it was a really, really good
dialogue, good discussion.
We've had over 200 Days of Understanding where we bring together teammates and give them an opportunity to
just dialogue and talk about what's going on, challenges that they face. Those have been really, really great
sessions. I participated in some and found them to very, very informative and helpful. We're in the process of
doing even more town halls. We've conducted unconscious bias training. So, we're doing a lot to try to help our
communities and our teammates weather through the storm and get better through the storm, and I feel really
good about that.
I'll show you how it's playing out with regard to second quarter highlights on slide 6. We're very pleased that we
had a taxable equivalent revenue of $5.9 billion. It was up 7%, but as you know, that was merger timing affected.
We did have adjusted net income of $1.1 billion. Feel good about that. Diluted earnings per share on a GAAP
basis were $0.67, but our adjusted basis earnings were $0.82, which was very, very strong relative to the
environment.
Our return on average common equity on an adjusted basis was 7.26%. Return on average tangible common
adjusted was 14.17%. And I was very pleased that our adjusted efficiency ratio was 55.8%, which is very strong in
this environment. Our asset quality, in terms of actual metrics, which you can get more detail on from Clarke,
were actually fantastic. But as we all know, that was substantially impacted by a lot of the CARES Act decisions
around forbearances, et cetera. So, we know that it will get worse, and that's why we're prepared well in terms of
our reserving for our future allowances.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2020
We felt good about our fee income, got robust capital markets activity, residential mortgage was fantastic.
Insurance brokerage operation, which really, really is important in times like these, had a record quarter. We
continue to have very good expense discipline on a core basis, and our Common Equity Tier 1 increased by 0.4%
to 9.7%. So we felt very, very good about that.
If you look on page 7, I just want to hit a few of these material special items that affected the quarter. We did have
securities gains. So, these were non-agency mortgage securities that we had for a while. They had special gains
and some risk of downside loss on those gains, and so it was a good opportunity for us to take those. That did
provide $300 million of some pre-tax gain, or $0.17 diluted share. Now, we used most of that to extinguish debt.
We took a loss on that of $235 million before tax. That improves forward run rate, which Daryl can give you detail
on, but that was very good. That was a negative $0.13.
Then we did have substantial merger-related restructuring charges of $209 million, that was $0.12 negative. And
then, as we've explained to you, we do have incremental operating expenses that are related to the merger that
are technically merger related that we call out in a category, but they're not a part of our run rate going forward.
So, we consider those to be unusual, and that's $0.07. So, when you net through all that, it would be a positive
impact of about $0.15.
If you look at slide 8, just a few comments with regard to loans. It was a very interesting quarter for loans. I mean,
at the beginning of the quarter, loans were booming. We were having land draws like everybody else that were
substantial. We were engaged in PPP, where we were the third-largest PPP producer, producing about $13 billion
in those loans. We were happy to do that, although it was very hard in terms of supporting our small business
clients.
There was not much normal loan human activity in the quarter, so it was just kind of an unusual quarter. Our
average balances were $322 billion versus $315 billion in the period. So, you can see what happened, we
advanced up all the lines and then they started paying down. So now, 80% of the COVID-related line advances
have already been paid. So, that activity was kind of a rollercoaster. It settled down now, and we feel good about
where we are.
Consumer loans decreased slightly in this stressed environment just because people, broadly speaking, are
spending less. We did see a decrease in residential mortgage on the loans that we hold, but our mortgage
business in general is booming. We had mortgage applications of $21.3 billion in second quarter, and we
originated $14.6 billion in the quarter. So, we were really, really active in that and, frankly, moving resources into
the mortgage area, because that's a very, very important area for us.
We did have substantial activity increasing loans in indirect, which was primarily due to huge demand for loans to
finance recreational and power sports. So, we are seeing some robust activity in some categories, some
temporary robust activity in others. The underlying normal activity is, I'd say, relatively stable; not going down, not
going up. There's just not much going on right now for reasons you would understand. So we feel, overall, good
about our loan book and loan activity; and we think we're well-positioned as we go forward when confidence
returns to be able to meet the needs of our clients.
Just a couple of comments with regard to deposits on slide 9; deposits are booming. Our noninterest-bearing
deposits were $113 billion, up $20.7 billion on a linked-quarter basis. Total deposits were up $36 billion on the
same linked-quarter basis. I will tell you that the majority of that is core, but there are surge balances related to
line draws, PPP loans, and government stimulus. We believe there continues to be a flight to quality and we're the

beneficiary of that. Business accounts drove about 80% of the growth in DDA. So, that was what you would
expect, businesses drawing out lines, investing into deposit accounts, et cetera.
Deposit mix in the second quarter consisted of 30.7% noninterest-bearing deposits, which is very strong; 26% are
interest-bearing; 34% on money markets; and savings were 8.9%. Our cost of average deposits and average
interest-bearing deposits decreased 29 basis points from 38 basis points, respectively, down to 22 and 32 bps,
respectively.
So, it's a very, very strong story for deposits. I will say that we have a real opportunity in terms of our interest-
bearing deposits at 32 basis points. We didn't move them down as aggressively in the second quarter, maybe
some did. We wanted our clients to have time to adjust, but we see it as a real opportunity for us as we move into
third quarter, and we're already taking a very bold and decisive action with regard to that.
So, let me it turn now to Daryl for some more detail.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Today, I want to cover key points from the second quarter,
discuss current business conditions, and provide an update on cost saves.
Turning to slide 10. Net interest margin was 3.13%, down 45 basis points. Purchase accounting contributed 46
basis points to reported net interest margin versus 52 basis points last quarter. Core net interest margin was
2.67%, down 39 basis points, impacted by lower benchmark interest rates, higher Fed balances, and COVID-
related deferred interest.
The yield on loans and leases held for investment decreased 81 basis points due to lower interest rates, lower
purchase accounting accretion, and deferred interest on loans with forbearance. The yield on the securities
portfolio decreased 25 basis points primarily due to higher premium amortization.
Asset sensitivity moderated as a result of tighter fixed rate assets, lower fixed rate Federal Home Loan Bank
advances, and lower benchmark interest rates, mitigating down rate scenarios. We're projecting loan yields – or
we are protecting loan yields [ph] with great force (00:13:59) on new commercial obligations and modifications,
and we'll continue to manage down deposit costs. We expect to report net interest margin to be flat for the
remainder of the year.
Turning to slide 11. Noninterest income includes $300 million in security gains related to the sale of non-agency
MBS. Excluding these gains, core noninterest income was up $160 million. Investment banking and trading
income increased $156 million on strong core trading activity and elevated counterparty reserves in the prior
quarter. Residential mortgage income was up $96 million on strong volumes and improved margins, partially
offset by lower servicing due to higher prepayments. Refi was 65% of originations, and gain on sale was 319
basis points, reflecting very favorable conditions in mortgage.
Insurance income increased $32 million, up 5.8% to record levels, primarily due to seasonality and pricing.
Organic revenue grew 2.1% versus like quarter. Service charges on deposits decreased $103 million mostly due
to reduced incident rates. Card and payment related fees were affected by lower transaction volumes due to
lower consumer spend. Wealth income decreased $43 million as market devaluation impacted wealth fees.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2020
Turning to slide 12. Noninterest expense increased $447 million mostly due to a $235 million loss on debt
extinguishment, $102 million increase in merger and restructuring charges and $55 million increase in incremental
operating expenses related to the merger. Higher merger-related expenses reflected professional services
associated with integration and increased severance charges. We remain highly disciplined around core
expenses.
Excluding the above-mentioned items, adjusted noninterest expense increased $55 million. This was mostly due
to higher COVID-related operating costs and performance-based incentives, partially offset by lower marketing
and client development expense. We anticipate COVID-related operating expenses will decrease as we continue
to take measures to protect teammates, clients, and communities.
We identified areas where cost savings can be accelerated, including personnel expense, corporate real estate,
and third-party spend. We now believe we can accomplish 40% of the $1.6 billion in net cost saves by the fourth
quarter this year, up from 30% we previously shared. Our FTEs declined 735. We expect further reductions
throughout this year. We also closed 42 branches in nonoverlapping markets.
Turning to slide 13. Asset quality remained relatively stable, reflecting moderate deterioration in certain asset
quality ratios and improvement in others. Our NPA and NPL ratios increased 2 and 3 basis points, respectively to
25 and 35 basis points. Most of the NPL increase was in CRE, commercial construction, and leasing portfolios.
Net charge-offs increased 3 basis points to 39 basis points on average loans and leases.
Our provision for credit losses totaled $844 million, reflecting stressed environment and the allowance build of
$522 million. For the second quarter in a row, this allowance build has essentially self-funded by purchase
accounting accretion. The allowance was 1.81% of loans and leases, up from 1.63%. Our coverage ratios
remained strong at 4.49 times net charge-offs and 5.24 times NPLs. The combination of our allowance and
unamortized fair value market is very robust at 2.76% of total loans. Our asset quality ratios were tempered by
relief from the CARES Act.
Our teammates have been very responsive to our clients, helping them navigate the pandemic. As of June 30,
client accommodations totaled $13.8 billion in consumer loans, $21.2 billion in commercial loans, and $211 million
in credit card balances. This represented an 11.2% increase in the loan portfolio. About a quarter of the clients
who received an accommodation continue to make payments on their loan. We expect third quarter asset quality
metrics to deteriorate in response to COVID stress across the loan portfolios.
Turning to slide 14. As you can see on the table on the left, our exposure to vulnerable industries remains low and
reflects diversification we achieved from the merger of equals. Outstanding loans to sensitive industries totaled
$30.1 billion versus $28.4 billion. However, $1.1 billion was increased due to PPP loans. Excluding PPP loans,
sensitive industry outstanding increased only $200 million or about 1%. Energy-related balances were essentially
flat, and our oil and gas portfolio continues to be weighted towards lower risk sectors. Hotel, resort, and cruise line
outstandings increased to 2.4% of loans held for investment from 2.1% last quarter. This reflects the inclusion of
hotel REITs and real estate secured by hotels which were not previously included.
Outstanding balances to restaurants increased modestly to 1% of loans held for investment from 0.8% at the end
of March. Outstanding balances on leveraged loans totaled $9.5 billion, down 10% from last quarter. We are
actively managing our sensitive industry portfolios. This includes deep segment reviews and reflecting credit
adjustments in our risk rates.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2020
Turning to slide 15; the allowance increase of $522 million to reflect the consideration of increased economic
stress, the sensitivity to affected industries and the proactive grading changes to reflect the current environment.
The estimation process incorporates multiple economic scenarios, including assumed likelihood of worsening
conditions. Our assumptions include double-digit employment followed by sustained high single-digit
unemployment as we extended GDP recovery throughout the two-year forecast period.
We also considered the effect of government relief packages and payment accommodations on expected losses
and made adjustments as needed to address model limitations. Taking into account the ACL amount of $6.1
billion and dividing it by Truist and two heritage companies' net charge-offs for the past 12 months, we come up
with a 5.7 times coverage ratio, which we believe is strong.
Turning to slide 16, Truist is very well-positioned relative to peers in a strained credit environment. The table on
the left utilizes DFAST 2020 results. This shows our estimated loan loss rate of 5.1%, ranked third best among
peers and is 60 basis points better than the peer average. We also have significant loss absorbing capacity of
$9.2 billion due to combination of the ACL and the unamortized loan marks. Our loss absorbing capacity
represented 2.9% of end-of-period loans and 60% of $15.3 billion of 2020 DFAST stress losses. This slide shows
how the merger of equals enhanced the risk profile of both companies and produced a resilient and more
diversified balance sheet.
Turning to slide 13 (sic) [17], our capital ratios improved nicely across all ratios and remained strong. Reported
CET1 ratio improved to 9.7% from 9.3% the first quarter. CET1 ratio benefited from current earnings, lower risk
weighted assets and purchase accounting accretion. We issued $2.6 billion of preferred stock during the second
quarter to further improve our capital position. Our second quarter dividend and payout ratios were 67%. The
Truist board will vote on a resolution to approve the third quarter common dividend of $0.45 at the July meeting.
Turning to slide 18, we continue to see strong liquidity and we are prepared to meet the funding needs of our
clients through this challenging environment. Second quarter average LCR was 116% and our liquid asset buffer
was 17.8%. Our access to secured funding sources remains robust with over $200 billion in cash, securities, and
secured borrowing capacity. Holding company cash is sufficient to cover 21 months of contractual and expected
outflows with no inflows.
Turning to slide 19, we continue to be encouraged by the acceleration we've seen across the digital platform.
Digital commerce grew 11% during the year-to-date period through May. We also saw a 10% increase in the
number of active mobile app users over the past year. Digital transactions also increased nicely. Mobile check
deposits were up 23% from last May to this May. The acceleration in the digital has resulted in increased
paperless adoption as statement suppressions are up 5%.
One of the motivations of the merger was to combine technology with touch to generate trust with our clients and
to be able to meet their needs. That is why we are really pleased that the legacy BB&T mobile app, U, earned the
number one J.D. Power ranking in the 2020 U.S. Banking Mobile App Satisfaction Study. In addition, LightStream,
legacy SunTrust national online lending division, won the number one ranking in J.D. Power 2020 U.S. Consumer
Lending Satisfaction Study among personal loan lenders. These are great examples of the best of both
capabilities as Truist advances its diverse digital and online capabilities.
As it relates to guidance, we withdrew our 2020 annual guidance due to the uncertainty going forward. For the
third quarter, we are providing limited guidance based on the third quarter linked-quarter changes versus second
quarter. We expect taxable-equivalent revenue to be down 3% to 5% after excluding one-time security gains from
the sale of non-agency MBS. Factors impacting revenue include a reduction in earning assets, mostly due to the

line draw repayments, seasonally lower insurance income and lower residential mortgage spreads and servicing
income.
In addition, investment banking and trading faces a robust second quarter comp. We expect the reported net
interest margin to be flat and core net interest margin to increase modestly. Core non-interest expense, adjusted
for merger costs and amortization are expected to be down 1% to 3%. We also anticipate net charge-offs to be
between 45 basis points and 65 basis points.
Now, let me turn it back to Kelly for an update on the merger closing [indiscernible] (00:26:15) and Q&A.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thanks, Daryl. So, if you follow along on slide 20, I just want to mention a few things about how we're doing. The
good news is our cultural development is fantastic. In fact, I would say that it is accelerating because of the
challenges because people are facing some extremely difficult challenges day-to-day and that really kind of pulls
groups together. The sense of team play in the organization today is phenomenal, far better than I could have
ever hoped for. So we feel great about how we're doing in terms of the organizations coming together. We had
some really good recent developments. We branded Truist Insurance and Truist Foundation. We introduced
Advisor Desktop to heritage BB&T Financial Advisors, and we were able to consolidate social media platform
leveraging, Truist.com. Our conversions are, in many cases, right on schedule. For example, institutional broker
dealer, mortgage origination and wealth are right on schedule for the second half of this year and the first half of
next year.
We did tell you last quarter and throughout the quarter that we were reassessing the core bank conversion
because of all of the challenging circumstances that we've all faced. Those include, amongst others, a strategic
reallocation of resources for the COVID response.
When all of this hit, we had to focus on what was the most important at the moment. For example, we spent a lot
of our IT and other support resources in the PPP program and developing portals for our clients to do automatic
deferrals and developing automatic portals for automated scheduling so people can schedule appointments with
our people remotely. We had work-from-home transitions for Truist and our outsourced vendors as we got all of
the computers into everybody's homes. That just takes a little bit of time. And we did experience some critical
vendor disruptions that hampered our conversion activities.
So we want to take all that into account. We want to make sure we do it right, do it well. That's the most important,
and so we now anticipate the core bank conversion will be in the first half of 2022 versus the second half of 2021.
It's not a dramatic change, but it is one we wanted to report out to you and we think it's the best way to continue to
provide the highest quality service for our clients.
Still we are committed to our $1.6 billion of net cost saves as Daryl described, and we're very pleased that we're
able to pull-forward expense savings around facilities, vendor spend, and personnel cost. So we would now
expect 40% of the $1.6 billion on an annualized basis to be available to us this year by the fourth quarter. And
then we stay on track with 65% for the fourth quarter of 2021 and then the full 100% of fourth quarter 2022. So it's
just a little bit of pulling-forward in 2020 versus a little bit less than 2021. So we feel good about all of that and
think that will go very, very well.
Wrapping up on slide 21, just a couple of comments with regard to the value proposition we offer. You've heard
me say before, and I still continue to believe, this is a fantastic organization. The combination is excellent. It is

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2020
fantastic for our shareholders. And the reason is this: It is an exceptional franchise with diverse products,
services, and markets. It's the sixth-largest commercial bank in the United States. We have strong markets share
in vibrant, fast-growing MSA markets. None of that has changed.
We have a comprehensive business mix with distinctive capabilities in traditional banking, capital markets, and
insurance. And clearly, coming together, we've already experienced what we thought would happen, which is that
together, we get the best-of-breed, best talent, best technology, best strategy and best processes, and we really
saw that this quarter with a strong performance in investment banking and insurance; one from SunTrust, one
from BB&T, came together beautifully just like we thought it was.
We have a unique positioning to deliver best-in-class efficiency and returns. We feel very strong about the cost
saves as we've said and the projected efficiency ratios that we talked about. We still feel very confident about our
medium-term targets of ROTCE in the low 20s, adjusted efficiency in the low 50s, common equity tier 1 ratio of
10%. We're closing in on that right now, so this is going to be a best-in-class, efficient, highly profitable
organization. And largely that's because we have strong capital and strong liquidity and we have a very resilient
risk profile; very strong, prudent, experienced risk management team, conservative risk culture, diversified
benefits from the merger. We've stressed very well which you just saw and so we have a very defensive balance
sheet, which is insulated by purchase accounting marks, combined with the CECL credit reserves. So, all of that,
we knew would be true. We didn't know it would be tested as much as it is being in this environment but it really is
proving to be the kind of underlying or building support that we need to be a very resilient organization in this
environment.
And this is a very challenging environment. I will say to you that as difficult as it is, as difficult as it is to predict
what's going to happen in the future, I believe the economy is resilient. I believe ultimately we will be okay. I
believe the American people will do the right thing to create an equitable society with hope an opportunity for
everyone. Everyone wins when we have an opportunity for everybody to have an equitable future, and that's what
we're working very, very hard to. Personally, I believe we'll be a lot better off if we can get a lot more emphasis on
love and caring for each other and that will create a bright future for America and everyone in it.
I'm going to turn it back now to Ryan.

Kelly, I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the expense side. You mentioned that you're pulling-forward the cost
saves over the next couple of quarters. And maybe you can remind us how far along on that $640 million you are
already as of 2Q. And then give us some sense in the discussions you had to accelerate that in 2020. What else
you found that maybe you could add to the profitability opportunities here in 2021 as well? I know you kept to 65%
flat, but knowing you I'm sure you unearthed a few other potential items of cost saves.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah Betsy, as you would expect, we're doing a deep dive in all of those areas to be sure that we can continue to
provide high-performance profitability metrics even as we orchestrate through this difficult environment. The
pulling-forward is just frankly getting more aggressive than we had even originally planned with regard to vendor
renegotiations. We've got a ton of buildings as you might expect; duplicative buildings, some small, some large.
We've got a major task force working on that, and we've decided to be very aggressive in terms of consolidating
and eliminating a lot of these buildings. And that's pretty immediate cost reductions when you do that.
We have a very aggressive personnel rationalization plan in process. And a good bit of that is already underway
in 2Q as you alluded to. It will begin to slow down to the bottom line more in 3Q and 4Q as we get executing on it.
The plans are well-developed and now it's just a matter of executing our plans.
Now, keep in mind that while we're not calling this out as we head into the remainder this year and 2021, we also
have some really good opportunities in terms of revenue. Our integrated relationship management program is
going extremely well and we are redoubling our efforts with regard to that because this is a time when our clients
need us more than ever. And so we are across the organization, focusing on generating opportunities to help our
clients. And of course in so doing, we generated additional revenue for us. So we've got all of these expense
initiatives but they're huge revenue initiatives as well, which gives us great confidence.

We're focusing on the expense review. From day one, we didn't add in revenue opportunities as a part of
projecting, but I could just tell you that the development along the way in terms of realizing those revenue
synergies is going far better than I would have ever expected, including all of the COVID difficulties related to that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
And the only thing I would add to that, Betsy, is that in the first – or second quarter, we had some COVID-related
expenses. We talk about them but we don't carve them out. We believe that those COVID expenses will moderate
over the next quarter or so. So you'll be able to really see those cost saves once they've moderated. But we're
probably in the 15% to 20% range right now. And with the cost-savings that Kelly said that we are actively working
on, by the fourth quarter we'll have 40% of it we believe in the fold.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. And I'd also mention, too, Betsy, we – in addition to those items Daryl mentioned, we had COVID-related
reductions in income including money back on credit card purchases, the other types of incomes, NSF reductions,
waivers; so pretty big number. We haven't been trying to call that out because I think most people are trying to
kind of do the same thing, but it is material.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Right. So, maybe if you could just – as a follow-up to the question just talk a little bit about how you're anticipating
the forbearance programs that you have in place, fading from here? I'm not sure are you going to be retaining
people in forbearance until further notice? Do they roll off at a specific point in time and maybe speak to both the
loan side as well as the fee waivers that you just mentioned?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clarke R. Starnes A
Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Hey, Betsy, this is Clarke. I'll take the credit accommodation. I know Daryl and Kelly gave you the statistics there.
I would tell you this: We are seeing a substantially lower new incidence of accommodation requests. I think much
like others, the big wave was early on. And so our focus now is actually on the expiration of the initial forbearance
that we granted and whether they're going to need additional relief or not. So what we have been doing on both
the wholesale and the consumer side, we've marshaled substantial resources. We're actually reaching out to
these borrowers, whether they're individuals or whether they're businesses and trying to anticipate what they think
their needs or what their current financial situation and outlook is so that we can get a sense of what lies ahead.
And I can just tell you it depends on the individual situations we're seeing anywhere from 0%. I think they'll need
another accommodation to some asset classes that might be 50%. So we're trying to take all that into
consideration, be compliant with the CARES Act, but we're going to be much more thoughtful about the second
wave to make sure that we're not kicking the can down the road. And so, as we're doing these reviews, we're also
effectively, where it's appropriate, deferring the interest accrual and Daryl talked about that. We're actually – got a
reserve there if we think there's higher probability of re-default. And then we're also, through this re-grading, that's
definitely included in our modeling in our loan loss reserves.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Thanks. And on the fee waiver side, is that something that will sunset at some point?

Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yes. So, Betsy, on the fee waivers, we think it's about time to kind of eliminate those. To be honest, we had a lot
of discussion about it, but we've concluded that we've got to let our clients ease back into normal life planning and
financial planning, and so we've terminated that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher L. Henson A
Head-Banking & Insurance, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Betsy, this is Chris. I would add under Truist Cares, we did things like 5% cashback for grocery and
pharmacy; ATM fees for waivers for clients and non-clients. We did for the EIP, a 30-day relief credit for those
who did not have balances; and so all those things, to the point I think Kelly and Daryl were making, will come
back to us. We also had some service charge to bank cards, [ph] debit (00:40:29) card challenges which will
come back – at least or certainly a large portion of that will come back in 2021 as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q

Okay. So this should be over – starting in 3Q into 4Q and really full run rate by 1Q 2021 type of concept to that.

Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
On the core NIM, I know Daryl you mentioned that the core NIM should be up modestly in the third quarter. Can
you discuss what the drivers of that would be and if you would expect similar moderate expansion quarterly
thereafter on the core side? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, John, we're doing several things around that. Obviously, you saw us exit $20 billion of advances from
the home loan bank. They had rates north of 1%. We eliminated the negative carry that we had at the Fed and
earning 10 basis points, so that was an immediate lift to run rate. That's happening as we speak now. Kelly
touched on earlier how we are continuing – we have opportunity to continue to cut our core deposit rates. We
think that will come down substantially over the next two quarters, so we feel good about that.
If you look at, on the commercial area, 75% of all new originations and modifications got floors embedded into
their loans, and we think that will protect some of the yield from that perspective. And the other things we're
looking at right now it's kind of tricky on what assets you can grow at this time that helps run rate and capital, but
there are strategies like the Ginnie Mae buyout program where we are adding to that.
We're looking at maybe adding back our jumbo correspondent production that will add more earning assets there;
90% LTV [ph] seems to have variable (00:42:41) risk weights; the student lending that's government-guaranteed.
So, all those are capital-friendly that help run rate will be positive, and we're also looking at moving some of the
mix out of the Fed balance into the investment portfolio to some extent. So, all those I think will increase our core
margin which will help offset a slowdown as you have your reported margin, you have less fair value accounting
coming through every quarter, we're trying to offset that with all these actions that we're taking so we can keep
our margin flat.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Good. All right, that's helpful. And then on the, I guess, let's say on the expense side. First, I know you
indicated that you pushed back the core systems conversion and you cited some vendor disruptions. Have you
chosen a vendor for the core systems and will you be announcing that?
And then separately on the efficiency side, on the medium-term targets at the low 50s, just want to see – like how
much higher do rates need to be to make that a reality and what type of timeframe I guess? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
So, on the conversion, we have the full plan developed. We have time lines developed. We have all the parties
lined up in terms of executing. And as I said, we're executing literally as we speak in terms of the non-core bank
conversions, but for the core bank, all of that is lined up and moving forward. It's a big deal, so it's challenging, but
we're very confident in terms of moving forward in the time line we talked about.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2020
And Daryl can comment – but with regard to the efficiency ratio, you've heard me say over the years, that's just a
tough ratio because you've got a numerator and a denominator. But, look, we're at 55.8% adjusted in this
environment, without getting the benefits of the expense cuts from the conversion materially and the revenue
enhancements. So that's why we feel very, very confident getting into low-50s from where we are today.
The adjusted efficiency ratio will wash out to the normal efficiency ratio because all the merger, unusual costs and
all will go away. And so we feel very confident about that. So, even if rates stay relatively low, I'm optimistic we
could get down to that kind of level. Obviously, if rates go up, then that really helps.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. The only thing I would add to that, John, is that no matter what environment we're in, with putting the two
companies together and the scale and efficiency we have, we believe we'll be a top tier provider in efficiency in
any market condition that you have there.
So, if rates are higher, we'll have lower efficiency numbers. If rates stay lower, maybe they won't be quite as low
as what we're saying, but we still should be in the top couple of our peer group from that perspective. So we feel
very good about that.

And, John, this is Bill. Maybe just a – John, it's Bill. Just a little clarification maybe on the provider is the vendor
disruptions that we've had really are on the support and tech side. So our core providers that we've selected for
all the conversions that we talked about trust and brokerage and deposits and all those, those are all in great
shape and we're proceeding well. And so the challenge has really just been in the tech support.

...some of the fee income businesses. Obviously, insurance was very strong. I think last year you guided about
3% year-on-year, can you give some color there and just maybe if we could expect any momentum to continue on
the I bank and trading side? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher L. Henson A
Head-Banking & Insurance, Truist Financial Corp.
Sure. I'm happy to, Mike. This is Chris. Yeah. Really excited about the core; it's a record core as Kelly alluded to
earlier. And the three drivers of organic growth are really pricing, retention and new business. And so prior to
COVID, they were all kind of hitting in all cylinders. And what you have now is new businesses driven by GDP and
uncertainties of COVID are tailing down a bit but pricing is really robust.
So what we had in the core was pricing last quarter was up in the 4.5% range, closer to 5% this quarter. And it's
anticipated we'll continue to see acceleration for the remainder of this year and into 2021. I'll touch on why in just
a minute.
Client retention was in retail 90.3%, 84.1% in wholesale; also very strong. But what you're seeing there is a bit of
a shift with the COVID uncertainties. You're beginning to see some of the standard carriers that support retail to
really sort of pull back and refer to wholesale, which gets underwritten in the E&S markets that supports the
wholesale. So, over a period of a year, you've seen a little bit of maybe a couple percent down in retail but up
about 4% in wholesale and that really underscores sort of the power of our diversified model because we play in
both channels. In fact, at wholesale, you might even get this to a touch of our margin in today's world. So, that –
we actually benefit in that situation.
New business production where we were up maybe double-digits. Last quarter, we're down 4%. But what I would
say there is while – and that's really driven by GDP, what's going in the economy, uncertainties of COVID. But I
would say that our overall outlook is much more positive because of the price firming I just talked about. And we
also saw in the quarter a more stable exposure units than we expected. We just did not see the business failures.
It was just a limited number of business failures. And also the growing Excess & Surplus lines volume, the shift
from retail to wholesale that I had commented on just a minute. So, in the corridor, what all of that gave us was
organic growth in the 2.1% range. And I think what I had said was sort of flat to two and we were right on the
upper end of that range. So we felt very, very good about it in a market that I think some might would have
expected flat to slightly down.
Just another touch on pricing, you really are seeing upward momentum. I think we're going to continue to see all
coverage types were up except worker's comp. All sizes were up at least in the sort of 4.5%, 5.5% range. We saw
things like D&O up 9.3%, liability, professional liability up 6%, 7%, business interruption up 6%. I mean those are
big numbers. So what we would expect in the third quarter because of what Daryl had said earlier was we're
going out – we're coming out of the second quarter which is our strongest quarter of the year to our weakest
quarter of the year, the third quarter, which is purely seasonal. So you'll see something down in the 13%, 14%
range. But for the year, we're still forecasting organic growth while it would be soft in third or fourth quarter, we're
still seeing it in low single-digits for the remainder of 2020. It was really pricing sort of leading the way. So we feel
really strong – really good about it.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2020
William H. Rogers, Jr. A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
This is Bill. I'll take investment banking and trading side. We had a good quarter in investment banking. The things
that we want to see; equity origination, investment grade were all really strong. I think as Kelly noted it really is
highlighting the value of the franchise and I feel really good about the relationships with the commercial
community bank and the pipelines that we're building and the dialogues that we're having with clients. All that
being said, it's hard to predict quarter-to-quarter just because there's just more volatility and there's some market
dependency. But overall, momentum in that business I think is just a real strength of the Truist merger.
On the trading side, we just have a lower-risk, client-driven trading business that just has lower betas than these
other businesses. So, our core trading business was good in the areas that we wanted to be good in derivatives
market and trading again via the franchise, via the relationships, taxable fixed income, [ph] so with (00:51:41)
trading. And the real difference was the CBA; that recognition was just much lower in this quarter than it was last
quarter. And presuming the rate environment and credit environment that's stable, that could continue. So just a
really good long-term momentum; quarter-to-quarter, a little harder to predict.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher L. Henson A
Head-Banking & Insurance, Truist Financial Corp.
And Mike, it's Chris again, I might just comment on mortgage. We had, as Kelly alluded to, just an exceptional
mortgage quarter this quarter and Daryl said that we might expect it to tail down a touch.
I would tell you production we think is going to be just as strong, maybe even a little stronger. It's just that as the
industry brings on more capacity, the margin is going to tail down a touch. So, I mean we're in the 3.19% kind of
range this quarter and that combines retail at 4.50%, and correspondent is a touch lower too. But you're still going
to probably have in the mid to upper 2s kind of margin, and you've got additional service and cost, as Daryl
pointed out, but still going to be a very strong year. I mean the kind of year that would have been, frankly, I mean
the kind of quarter that would've been a year [indiscernible] (00:52:51), so very substantial kind of numbers
overall.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Very, very helpful. Just one follow-up question. If I exclude the items that you called out for non-interest expense
on a core base, it looks like the expense were $3.3 billion. Given the pull-forward of some of the cost savings and
lower incentive comp, is it safe to assume that expenses would be down in the third quarter? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. So in my prepared remarks, Mike, I said that we'd be down 1% to 3% linked-quarter excluding out those
items that I mentioned there. So we definitely believe it's going to have a [ph] trajectory down (00:53:34) in third
quarter and probably pretty good in the fourth quarter as well.

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
On your – just back on the margin, appreciated your comments on the drivers going forward. I was just wondering
what your assumptions were for the curve between amortization there and then your opportunity to lower deposit
costs if you're assuming you can sort of hit that pre-cycle low for the cost or if you think that you could actually
take those even lower given all the liquidity you have, which should seem like a fairly reasonable assumption.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. So what I would tell you is that we are at 32 basis point right now. If you look what our average in June
was, we were at 25 basis points, so we will probably be in the low 20s, maybe peers through 20% – or 20 basis
points in the third quarter, probably by fourth quarter we'll be in the teens.
On heritage BB&T side, the lowest we got in the last crisis was 20 basis points. I don't have with me what heritage
SunTrust was handy. But we're clearly headed lower. I think we're going to be lower than before. And our
assumptions on the margin outlook, we basically use the forward curve. Forward curve basically has no rate
movements for the next couple years; pretty flat curve. So, we're not anticipating any increase. We're just trying to
take actions that we think are prudent that we can take in this stressed environment to help improve core margin
which should help alleviate some of the offset of the fair value accounting accretion [indiscernible] (00:55:39).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
And any help on reduced securities [indiscernible] (00:55:44)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
We always tend to buy securities with a 2% premium or less. We've done that for many, many years because we
don't like to have a lot of [ph] leap year (00:55:58) volatility. But you're seeing CPRs in the marketplace now at
30%, so they're prepaying pretty fast. If you look at our investment portfolio, we're in the mid- to high-$70 billion
range. Our cash flows coming off are about $4.5 billion to $5 billion a quarter right now. So, you are getting some
of that amortization that we're seeing there. So we're reloading and trying to add to it, but it's hard to find
securities that don't have big premiums, so we're being as selective as we can from that perspective.

Are you seeing other opportunities to move the needle with more FHLB paydowns?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
We are almost all out of Federal Home Loan Bank paydowns. I think we have $1 billion left or whatever. That's
going to roll off, I think, later this year. So, if we were to do anything right now, I'm not saying we would, but the
only thing left you can really do from a liability perspective is tender any outstanding debt. We have not made a
decision to do any of that, but that's the only thing we'll have to. And then, as we aggressively push down deposit
rates, we will be good to our clients; but non-clients, we're going to push them down really, really low. And if they
leave, that's okay because we have huge balances at the Fed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Great. And then maybe just one, switching to credit; you have some acceleration of the pandemic in your
markets. Did you guys make any overlays in your CECL process for that, and what that can mean for the
reserving next quarter if you see that accelerate, or you're already assuming that in your base case, that you'll get
further acceleration?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clarke R. Starnes A
Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Hey, Dave. This is Clarke. We did consider that. And as we've gone through, I mentioned these deep dive reviews
by [ph] segments (00:57:48); that would include geographies as well and even things like individual property
levels and submarkets. So, we have considered that and tried to take that into consideration on our estimates,
which obviously did assume further deterioration.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Great. And then just maybe as a last follow-up to that, what are you guys hearing from business customers on the
ground on how they're feeling about the pandemic in the background; and is there any outside caution there?
Does that mean more deposit growth or less loan growth going forward? Just any thoughts there would be great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
So, from what we're hearing from clients, I would say pandemic-wise, our clients – for the most part, our small
business clients are probably the ones most impacted right now, because they just don't have the same reserves
that larger companies do. So, larger companies, depending on what scenarios you're in, some are under
stressed, some are actually doing really well. It's a really broad spectrum there from that perspective.
From a [indiscernible] (00:59:05) they've been actively grading down the more stressed credits, so you're seeing
that reflected and that showed up in our allowance numbers on that. But from a deposit, we have huge deposit

growth. The DDA growth that we got, the $20 billion that Kelly mentioned, 80% of that was coming from
businesses. That will probably moderate over time.
And if you look at the growth that we've gotten from our interest checking and MMDA, most of that is coming from
personal, and I think that, that will also get spent and moderate over time. It all depends on the government
comes up with more stimulus checks, then that might add back to the balances there.

One of the interesting things we're finding that, I must admit, I was a little bit positively surprised about is the
resiliency of our clients. When we talk to our regional presidents and our people that are dealing directly with
clients, in many, many cases, they're saying, well, the clients feel pretty good given the environment and the
reason is because they learned their lesson 10 years ago in the Great Recession, and when this hit, they acted
fast. They cut their expenses. They tried to be creative in terms of generating other revenues. And they're hanging
on much, much better than I might have expected.
Now, some of the very tiniest micros of businesses are having the hardest time because they don't have all – they
don't have any rainy day fund. They live kind of day-to-day. But for small – most of our small business clients,
they have some resiliency, but mostly they responded very fast. Now, if it hangs on a long time, it just will be hard.
But if this recovers reasonably quickly, I think we may be pleasantly surprised at how well our business
community actually performs.

Christopher L. Henson A
Head-Banking & Insurance, Truist Financial Corp.
And this is Chris, Kelly, just to reinforce your point; over half our 24 regions are actually on goal for the lending
business today. And what's really good to see is two of the top regions are – like West Virginia, Virginia West,
some of our core – corest of core regions, and so I absolutely agree with what you're saying.

Amanda Larsen Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, guys. This is Amanda Larsen on for Ken. You mentioned that the COVID-19-related deferred interest
reduced NIM by 5 basis points. Was that's just accounting or was that a choice that you guys made for prudence
to not accrue interest on customers that are experiencing duress?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, just based on our prior experience, Amanda, in the last crisis, we know that some of the people that are
on payment deferral are going to end up in charge-off, and we don't want to have any surprises. So we're using a
lot of metrics depending – portfolio-specific on what percentages people will carry through and might not be able

to make their payments, and it varies by each portfolio. But this quarter, it was around $50 million for us, and
that's what we backed out of our net interest income from an accrual basis.
So we did a little bit in the first quarter. Now, we're continuing to manage and monitor that. But we think it's
prudent accounting just to basically make sure that we are going to accrue what we think we're going to get paid
back on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Amanda Larsen Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Great. And then, separate question; can you provide updated thoughts on the capital stack? You guys
issued $2.5 billion of preferred, bringing your preferred to ROAs up to like 1.85%. Do you expect to continue to
run with this bucket kind of oversized relative to 1.5% sort of optimization level? Like, what's your thought process
here and how does it tie in with the strategy of the overall funding base?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, Amanda we are just taking it day by day, and as we know certain things, but right now we're still in a
stressed period. So, we're going to keep our capital stack pretty strong. We do have the ability to call some of the
preferred out over the next year or two if things were to lighten up. That would be about $1.5 billion or so. But,
right now, I think we want to keep our capital really strong.
We continue to evaluate and make sure that we have enough. We're managing the capital for stress and what
could come our way from that perspective. But we have a lot of flexibility and we'll make prudent decisions and
we'll let you know when we make those decisions right now. But, right now, we're happy with the capital that we
have.

Erika Najarian Q

Hi. Good morning. Just one follow-up question, if I may. As we think about $5.7 billion in terms of your loan loss
reserve, is the majority – is reserve building behind you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clarke R. Starnes A
Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Hey, Erika. This is Clarke. Obviously, I'm sure you've heard this from others, we follow our process, we look at our
models, our economic scenario assumptions, our client behaviors, and the deep dives around the specific
industries, and we do everything we can in the CECL process to estimate what we think those lifetime losses are.

So, obviously, if those scenarios play out differently, our clients perform differently than we had forecasted then
that would adjust what we would need to do in the future. So, for now, we think we've done the very best estimate
we can with the information that we've been able to evaluate.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Clarke, can you share with us, when you look at the portfolio today, and I know this is going to take some
guesswork, but 18 months from now when we're following through this crisis do you think the greater credit losses
may show up in the consumer side of the house or the promotional side? And when I think of commercial, where
in the commercial side of the house is the greater stress? Is commercial real estate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clarke R. Starnes A
Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Great question, Gerard, and we debate that every day. Certainly, for us right now, while we're concerned about
the consumer, we're watching it very closely; follow the stimulus support and the savings and different things. It's
holding up relatively well, even if you take out the forbearance benefit that we provided.
I think our concern right now is more on the commercial side. If you look at our reserve allocation even again for
this quarter, it was 80% plus on the wholesale side. So, I think that's what – we're looking at things like what does
– how does the hospitality or some of these sensitive areas or other structural changes in office or other property
types. So, I think the wholesale side, based on various certain industry segments and CRE types are where we're
putting most of our focus right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. Darryl, when we looked at the DFAST results, it seems like your results weren't as strong as they
should have been in PPNR and even some of the credit losses. Is there any way of addressing that with the Fed
or you just really have to just take what they give you and just work your way through it?

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2020
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Gerard, we did do a press release earlier that week when – after the numbers came out on Thursday. We said
that we thought potentially that our numbers on provision we thought should have been a little bit lower. It's hard
to know – when you're doing incurred method, you have to really know when the loans come off and when they
stay on the books and to know when it has to get reloaded with new originations. And if you don't have that data, I
think it's hard to actually forecast that. I think, in their model methodologies, they say they try to account for it, but
you really need to have good instruments and forecasting to know what loans are coming on and off.
Then, on fair value accounting, if you have PPNR models that are based upon historical results, this is probably
the worst time you could model PPNR because the company just came together in December, and we had maybe
three weeks of purchase accounting, so you really didn't have anything. You did have one year of noninterest
expense and that appropriately got loaded into our run rate, and we're going to have that for the next year or two
and that will fade away.
But fair value accounting is real. It's alive. We had over – almost $1 billion in the first two quarters of this year that
we basically were able to use that from an earnings perspective and we kind of think of it that it kind of helped
fund our allowance build. It wasn't exact, but it was like 90-plus percent what the amount was. It just happened
that way, but didn't really have any earnings impact off of our core earnings because of that.
So, we feel over time that our history will be loaded with fair value accounting and that will get done appropriately.
We are actively meeting with the Fed. They're here, as you know, constantly, and we're giving them all the
information, sharing everything that we have. And we hope, down the road, that we will get better results. And we
still think, long-term, our MOE, we should be top tier performing not just on the loss rate, but also on the PPNR
and on the capital resiliency. It might take two or three years to get the expenses out of our run rate but, hopefully,
by year three from now, we're going to be in the top quartile, if not the best, in our peer group.

Brian Klock Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. And thanks for going over the hour and taking my question. Just a real quick credit follow-up for Clarke. I
guess can you talk about the reserve build for the second quarter, and kind of how much of that could be related
to either the downgrades that you mentioned earlier? And then maybe you can talk about the change in
[indiscernible] (01:10:24) assets quarter-over-quarter, too, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clarke R. Starnes A
Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Great question. You'll see our [indiscernible] (01:10:31) assets when we file the Q. But I mentioned this deep dive
and re-grading process we went through. So, effectively, on the wholesale side, we've actually – in the sensitive
industry areas, we've done deep dives. And as an example, on the hospitality area, we covered 90% of our total
exposure there on a borrower-by-borrower basis and re-enter every one of those and done that through a similar
process for the other sensitive industries and then for any client that's had an accommodation. And so, we've
marshaled a ton of people to do that.
And so, we're getting real-time information. That has certainly impacted our grading. So, we proactively
downgraded a good number of credits. The biggest stress we've seen in the downgrades has been in hospitality
and things like CRE retail. So, all of that is baked in to our second quarter estimate. And as I mentioned, about
80%-plus of the additional increase is related to those – to wholesale and particularly to those sensitive industry
areas.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Thanks. Just a quick one for Daryl on the PPP forgiveness. Is that something that you can kind of have the
certainty about in terms of how it might impact the year-end and first part of next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
I can tell you our assumptions, Chris. This is obviously a new product and we'll see how it all plays out. But if you
look at the fees, obviously, we set them up on the loan system and they get amortized to go over a two-year time
period. But as they get the forgiveness and then get paid back, all of that left accretion to that loan would actually
come into earnings in that time period.
So our assumptions are that we believe 75% of our production in PPP will get forgiveness. We believe that – this
is the timing that we put in our models. In the fourth quarter, 30% of the 75% will get forgiven, 65% of the 70% will

get forgiven in the first quarter of 2021, and then the remaining 5% of the 75% in quarter two of 2021. The other
25% we think will go all the way to term from that perspective. That's our estimate. It's about our best guess. We
did modify it, so we pushed out a little bit. PPP is very fluid. It tends to change a lot. So we'll see how things would
react, but this is our best estimate right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got it. And that'll impact the margin when it happens, but I imagine you'll break that out. So, this would be a
onetime event [indiscernible] (01:13:29) quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. We'll mention that. I mean, it's in our run rate now a little bit because you're still amortizing basically the feel
over that two-year time period. So, like, for this quarter, it was worth about $49 million of our net interest income
for the second quarter.
