Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Today, we reported first quarter
earnings of $138 million or $0.98 per share. Although loan demand remained muted, we continue to see
improvement in customer sentiment, translating into increased pipelines and signaling opportunities for growth.
Our historically strong deposit franchise demonstrated resilience as deposits outperformed expectations and
normal seasonal patterns. These favorable trends enabled continued normalization of our liquidity even as we
reduced wholesale funding by over $5 billion throughout the quarter.
In fact, over the last four quarters, we repaid almost $12 billion in wholesale funding of reserving significant
available capacity. Beyond our financial results, we were incredibly proud of recognition received for our efforts to
prioritize our employees and communities. Greenwich award showcased our successful focus on small business
and we see great potential for continued growth in this space.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
Earlier this month, we hosted an event at our new collaborative workspace in North Texas and our second large
office transformation is underway in Michigan. As a product of our modernization efforts these business and
innovation hubs leverage advanced technology designed to meet the evolving needs of our colleagues and
customers through dedicated business centers. Immediate feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and we
feel this workplace strategy will be key to attracting and retaining talent while offering unique benefits to small
businesses and local communities.
First quarter financial highlights are on slide 4. Average loans were impacted by rationalization efforts from 2023,
including the exit of Mortgage Banker Finance, which is now substantially complete. Deposits outperformed
expectations and in fact would have been relatively flat, excluding the deliberate reduction in brokered time
deposits.
Net interest income was impacted by lower loans, slightly higher deposit costs and one less day in the quarter,
but overall performed better than projected. Credit remains strong as net charge offs moved even lower this
quarter. Both noninterest income and noninterest expenses were impacted by notable items and we saw a
discrete benefit to taxes. Prudent capital management and lower loans drove an increase in our estimated CET1
to 11.47%, even higher above our 10% strategic target. Stepping back, strong liquidity, credit and capital supports
our solid foundation and positions us to prioritize responsible growth in the second half of the year.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim to review our financial results in some more detail. Jim?

James J. Herzog
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Well, thanks Curt, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 5, impacts from intentional balance sheet
management efforts in 2023 carried over into the first quarter and when coupled with soft demand, drove
downward pressure on average loan balances. Lower utilization was a trend in both Middle Market, where
customers use deposits to repay debt and invest in their business. In Equity Fund Services, where we observed
continued softness in private equity activity. Conversely, Commercial Real Estate utilization continued to trend
higher as we funded multifamily and industrial construction projects while managing commitments lower. As we
look month-to-month throughout the quarter, we saw balances decrease only modestly and a steadily increasing
pipeline which together support our expectation for growth.
Slide 6 highlights the stability of our deposit base. Average deposit balances declined $700 million, but almost
$600 million was attributed to lowering brokered time deposits. Otherwise, declines in Technology and Life
Sciences, Equity Fund Services and Commercial Real Estate were largely offset by increases in general Middle
Market, entertainment and retail. In fact, retail balances are nearing pre-March 2023 levels, with growth in both
small business and consumer.
Our mix of noninterest bearing balances remained a competitive advantage, averaging 40% for the quarter, as
both interest bearing and noninterest bearing deposits exceeded expectations. As anticipated, elevated rates
continue to drive deposit pricing higher to 328 basis points in a cumulative beta of 62%. However, the pace of
increase continued to flatten, as it has for the past four quarters. Our deposit profile remains a competitive
strength and we were encouraged by this quarter's results.
As shown on slide 7, we normalized our liquidity position and in this quarter alone, we are able to repay over $5
billion in wholesale funding while retaining significant capacity. Over the last year, our liquidity strategy proved
effective as we added liquidity to navigate volatility and then methodically normalized our position as the market
stabilized. We were incredibly proud of our $1 billion debt issuance in late January, a record issuance for

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
Comerica, investor interest was high and the execution was effective, which to us signaled progress towards
more normal market activity and interest in our value proposition. At 80%, our loan-to-deposit ratio remained
below our 85% medium-term target, positioning us to prioritize high-return loan growth going forward.
Period-end balances in our securities portfolio on slide 8 declined with continued paydowns and maturities, in
addition to a $268 million negative mark-to-market adjustment from a higher forward curve. We expect continued
decline in this portfolio over the coming quarters.
Turning to slide 9. Net interest income decreased $36 million to $548 million, driven by lower loan balances and
higher deposit pricing, partially offset by fed deposits and lower wholesale funding. While lower noninterest-
bearing balances also contributed to the quarter-over-quarter decrease, deposits overall outperformed
expectations, with favorable deposit trends, lower FHLB advances, a moderating deposit beta, and a $3 million
noncash BSBY [ph] accretion (08:09), net interest income exceeded guidance.
As shown on slide 10, successful execution of our interest rate strategy and the composition of our balance sheet
positions us favorably for a gradual 100 basis points or 50 basis points on average decline in interest rates. By
strategically managing our swap and securities portfolio while considering balance sheet dynamics, we intend to
maintain our insulated position over time.
As a reminder, BSBY cessation does not impact the ongoing cash flow associated with the swap notionals listed
on the slide. While we took noncash losses in the fourth and first quarters, we will accrete them back with the
majority coming back into net interest income in 2025 and 2026. Now that we have fully redesignated the
remaining impacted swaps, we have included quarterly BSBY-related net interest income projections in the
appendix for your modeling.
Moving to slide 11. We expect the attrition of our swap and securities portfolio to create positive earnings
momentum. Scheduled swap maturities outpace the remaining forward starting swaps in 2024. By the end of
2025, we expect lower overall notional balances and a 14-basis-point increase in swap yields, creating a tailwind
for net interest income.
Within our securities portfolio, we expect approximately $4 billion in repayments and maturities by the end of
2025. Although some of this may be partially offset by reinvestments in the portfolio, we expect to redeploy that
liquidity at substantially higher rates. Altogether, we expect these portfolio trends to benefit our earnings
trajectory.
Credit quality remained strong, as highlighted on slide 12. Net charge-offs of 10 basis points declined from the
fourth quarter, which were already below our normal range. Elevated interest rates continued to pressure
customer profitability and debt service ratios, which drove migration in general Middle Market and Senior Housing.
Our Senior Housing exposure is limited by design; and with a geographically diverse new construction orientation,
recourse and potential for favorable macroeconomic and demographic tailwinds, we feel the risk is very
manageable.
Total portfolio normalization trends resulted in an increase in the allowance for credit losses to 1.43% of total
loans. Nonperforming assets also increased, but still remained well below historical averages. Overall, our trends
remained in line with expectations; and while we continue to monitor the portfolio very closely, we believe ongoing
migration will remain manageable.

On slide 13, first quarter noninterest income of $236 million, included a $39 million noncash loss related to the
BSBY loan hedges not yet to be designated. This compared to a $91 million BSBY impact in the fourth quarter.
And since we have now fully redesignated the remaining impacted swaps, we do not expect additional mark-to-
market volatility related to BSBY cessation.
Fiduciary income was impacted by accrual adjustments in trust and accounting changes associated with our
Ameriprise transition. Initial feedback on Ameriprise has been positive, and we continue to think this partnership
can drive meaningful revenue growth over time. First quarter capital markets income was seasonally light, as
higher syndication fees were offset by declines in interest rate and energy derivative products. We had a $5
million miscellaneous item in the first quarter related to a vendor contract, but we would not expect that benefit to
repeat.
Expenses on slide 14 included an estimated $16 million additional special FDIC assessment, incremental to the
$109 million charge taken in the fourth quarter. Excluding this assessment and deferred compensation, expenses
performed in line with expectations for the quarter. Generally, we saw a seasonal declines across most expense
categories with lower severance and temporary labor, offset partially by stock compensation.
Further, we saw the benefit of lower pension expense, which will be consistent throughout the year. Expense
recalibration actions announced last quarter are underway, and we expect the majority of identified colleague
separations and banking center closures to occur in the second quarter. We remain keenly focused on ongoing
expense management to support investments and enhance overall earnings.
Slide 15 highlights our conservative capital position as our estimated CET1 grew to 11.47%. Although we are
below $80 billion in assets, our estimated CET1, adjusting for the AOCI opt-out, was already above the required
regulatory minimums and buffers. Despite higher unrealized AOCI losses due to the rate movement tangible
common equity increased to 6.36%.
We expect unrealized losses to burn down over time as securities repay and swaps mature, but the rate curve
continued to create near-term volatility. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, we favor a conservative
approach to capital management and plan to monitor ongoing AOCI movement and regulations as they evolve.
Our outlook for 2024 is on slide 16. We project full year average loans to decline 3%, largely due to optimization
efforts in 2023. Despite soft first quarter demand and the higher rate curve. We still see constructive signs in
customer sentiment and pipeline supporting our projected 4% to 5% point-to-point growth. With average loans
expected to be flat to down 1% in the second quarter, we still anticipate broad-based growth in the second half of
the year.
Full year average deposits are expected to be down 2% to 3% from 2023 or down 1% to 2% point-to-point. This
assumes our new lower level of brokered time deposits remains flat from March 31 and represents an improved
average customer deposit outlook for the year. Excluding brokered time deposits, we expect year-end 2024
deposits to exceed year-end 2023.
Our year-over-year net interest income outlook down 11% remains unchanged despite movement in the rate
curve. Strong deposit performance as well as moderating deposit betas largely offset the reduction in the number
of rate cuts. As a point of clarity, we used the April 10 forward curve to reflect the most recently published CPI
number and market consensus, reflecting two rate cuts in the second half of the year.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
As I mentioned at a conference last month, movement in the rate curve since 12/31 does push our projected net
interest income trough into the second quarter, but as you can see in our guide, we do not expect the quarter-
over-quarter decline to be significant. Credit quality remained strong and we expect continued migration to be
manageable.
We forecast full year net charge-offs to move into the lower half of our normal 20 basis point to 40 basis point
range. We expect noninterest income to grow 1% to 2% on a reported basis, which would be down 1% year-to-
year, when adjusting for BSBY and Ameriprise as detailed on slide 39. With the higher forward curve, risk
management income is expected to remain strong and we project growth in most customer related fee income
categories in the second quarter and throughout the year.
Full year noninterest expenses are expected to decline 3% on a reported basis, but grow 3% after adjusting for
special FDIC assessments, expense recalibration and Ameriprise. As always, this assumes deferred
compensation of $0 for the remaining quarters. Projected second quarter expenses should come down from the
first quarter due in part to seasonal compensation and we expect to see the benefit of savings related to our
recalibration efforts throughout the year.
Continued strategic investment remains a priority and the bar for regulatory compliance and risk management
framework continues to rise. So we are working to offset and self-fund these increasing pressures. We saw a
discrete tax benefit in the first quarter, but excluding discrete items, we're projecting 24% tax rate for the full year.
Even with projected loan trends, we expect to maintain capital well in excess of our 10% target.
We will continue to monitor AOCI volatility and the evolving regulatory environment as we continue to take a
conservative approach to share repurchases. Overall, favorable deposit trends put us on the great path to start
the year, and we feel very good about the earnings trajectory of our business.
Now I'll turn the call back to Curt.

Curtis Chatman Farmer
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Thank you, Jim. We understand the heightened industry focus on the timing of rate cuts and what that means for
quarterly net interest income and we think we have a compelling earnings trajectory. However, as we think about
the true value in our business, we think it's important to take a step back and reinforce our differentiated value
proposition as shown on slide 17.
As a leading bank for business with strong wealth management and retail capabilities, our tenured colleague
deliver value-added expertise to our enviable customer base. Our highly regarded approach to credit, coupled
with our commitment to diversification, mitigates risk of loss and has historically outperformed peers. Customer
feedback reinforces our belief that we are the right size to deliver a tailored products while adding value to their
business and providing a high level of service. Product investment and strategic partnerships such as Ameriprise
that we entered into last year are designed to further enhance our core set of solutions.
The resilience of our operational deposit base was highlighted this quarter as we outperform normal seasonal
patterns and maintain a favorable deposit mix. We remain committed to managing the company for the long-term,
which means taking targeted expense actions like those announced last quarter while still prioritizing investments
in our future. With our strong capital base, proven approach to credit and commitment to risk management, we
see positive momentum for reasonable growth and enhanced profitability.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
I appreciate your time this morning and now we'd be happy to take some questions.
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question is
coming from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Ken.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
[audio gap] (19:21) about improving profitability and the implied improvement in NII throughout the year, just
wondering, I want to make sure that after this dip in the second quarter, then it seems like we could see quite a
sharp increase in the second half NII. Just – can you help us understand like what that cadence looks like? So if
it's down a little bit, is it up and even more up to exit or because the implied sequential feels like it could be like
570-ish kind of getting towards the end of the year. And I just want to make sure we understand, like, how that
looks as these deposit pricing and [ph] last (19:52) kind of things move through. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
All right, good morning, Ken. It's Jim, I'm happy to answer that question. Yeah, number one, we do see an
increasing rate of improvement quarter-to-quarter as we go through the year from second to third and third to
fourth. And frankly, I expect that trend to continue even beyond the fourth quarter of this year and we do have a
lot of momentum behind us.
If I look at some of the big drivers that are driving that momentum, probably at the top of the list would be the
maturing swaps and securities. And we do try to outline what that benefit could be on slide 11, showing those
various maturities and they do pick up momentum as we move through the year, and into next year. So I'd
probably list that as one of the biggest drivers, but I would also say loan volume is going to almost be an equally
large driver.
If you look at the guide that we gave, it implies a pretty significant hockey stick up in the last couple of quarters of
the year. And so we're certainly pick up some income there, probably on a lesser basis. Obviously, we'll get some
more days in the second half of the year. And then the liability sensitivity, which will not be as large but will be a
factor, will start to kick in in the second half of the year or two. So it will be a nice, smooth trajectory upward and
we do feel really good about that momentum.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great. Okay. And as a follow-up, just on the deposit side, you mentioned that you think deposits will end higher at
the end of the year. I think the mix is still important. How do you expect that DDA to total deposit mix to go? I
mean, granted, it's all good in a – the absolute range if it's still all moving up. But just can you help us understand
the mix? Thanks.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Happy to do that. And just to re-clarify that will be excluding brokered deposits, time brokered deposits,
since obviously we don't consider those customer related, those are down quite a bit even since the end of 2023.
So that guidance was excluding those. But putting that aside, we do expect the mix to stay somewhat consistent
right now. We'll continue to monitor it and as you know a little bit higher for longer environment, but it's been
holding up very good to-date.
And as we look out into the future, we do expect it to continue to hold up. To the extent it dips below 40%, which
we're not projecting at this time it's more likely to be – due to the success with interest bearing deposits as
opposed to any challenge with noninterest-bearing. So we think our – yeah, mix will continue to be peer leading
and a real competitive advantage for us.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Curtis Chatman Farmer A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. Also on the NII expectation, I know you indicated that the curve has essentially pushed the NII
trough into the second quarter, but you also mentioned some of the dynamics of an improving trajectory. Can you
maybe give us some color if we do not get a forward curve and we do not get cuts at all in 2024, what does that
mean for your NII, not only the timing of the trough, but the broader outlook? And then can you just remind us
what fed cut assumption do you have currently in your expectation?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, I mean, right now on the expectations, we follow the forward curve that came out right after the CPI reports,
so we're sticking pretty closely to that, which reflects just under two cuts in the second half of the year. If we don't
get those cuts, I did mention a liability sensitivity and that's a very slight sensitivity position. We're very close to
interest neutral. So I would not want to overplay that.
I think if we don't get the cuts because we are so close to interest neutral, it's not so much the sensitivity that
causes the challenge. But I think what causes the challenge for the whole industry is with flat rates, you still have
the potential for depositors to ask for higher pay rates. So I do think probably all banks will see slight increases in
pay rates if – over the course of the year and into next year, if rates weren't going to change. I do expect that to

be a slight impact. But those would be the two factors. We lose a tiny bit of liability sensitivity, which is more of a
minor factor for this year. But you also run the risk of continued rising pay rates as we move through the year
also.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay, great. That helps. Thank you. And then separately on the loan growth side, I know you revised your
average loan growth guide to down 3%. I mean, you cited some muted demand, but improving pipeline and the
expectation of a back half pickup in growth. Can you maybe talk about the confidence in that pickup. Where do
you see loan generation strengthening? What anecdotal data supports that expectation? Because, clearly, we're
seeing industry pressure at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Chief Banking Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Hey, John. This is Peter. So, yeah, when you say 3% down, that's the average year-over-year and our outlook
now is 4% or 5% point-to-point for 2024. And I would say, as we did in the comments here, it's pretty broad-
based. We've got some give and takes as we go throughout the year across our portfolio. I think, in general,
though, Middle Market is kind of where we feel probably the best about that. We did a lot of rationalization in
2023, coming into 2024 that, I think, is sort of affected us for the first quarter and will a little bit in the second. But
we're pretty much past that rationalization. And I think from here on, we feel good about being able to project the
4% to 5% point-to-point.
And again, I'd say it's pretty broad-based across really all of our businesses that you see in the deck that we
show. There are kind of some that, I would say, are probably more impacted by the interest rates higher for longer
than others, but I would say that that's mostly kind of in our small business, business banking, maybe private
banking space. But in general, Middle Market and up, I think, it seems like we're seeing really, really good
opportunities. And again, the pipeline has grown and really feel like that's going to be an opportunity throughout
the year.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thank you, guys. Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. So, Jim, was hoping – and a lot of good
detail on slide 11 regarding the swaps and the securities that'll be – become a pretty meaningful tailwind as we go
forward. Are you able to sort of help size just the way you sort of think about things internally, just order of
magnitude of how much NII could improve over the course of the next couple of years and some of your peers
have given sort of a longer out margin outlook. Just anything you're comfortable giving. I think there's sort of a
wide range of expectations for what earnings could look like at Comerica over the next couple of years. So just
anything that helps sort of narrow the cone a little would be great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, happy to do that, Scott. It's going to depend somewhat on how we redeploy that liquidity. So there is going
to be a range of outcomes there. But we do pick up increasing momentum as we move through this year, that'll
continue into next year. Next year, we are going to be pretty far north of $100 million of net benefit, netting out the
maturing securities and swaps versus what we might reinvested in.
And that benefit next year will also increase positive momentum upward as we move through 2025. And so, the
exit rate for 2025, going into 2026, will also be very substantial. So there is a pretty incredible tailwind coming our
direction as it relates to some of these maturities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, perfect. Thank you. And then maybe if you could speak in a bit more detail around thoughts on the capital
management. You've been very appropriately conservative. I think the rate moves in the first quarter in particular
kind of validated that. But just curious if there's a point where you just get more comfortable in resuming

repurchase in spite of kind of the volatility in the rate backdrop, just given what we know will be coming due and
sort of going away over the next couple of years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah, that is something we continue to monitor very closely. Obviously, the first – as we've said many times
before, the first use of capital for us is for our customers. And as you heard from Peter, we are expecting pretty
significant loan growth in the second half of the year. So we want to make sure we're there to support the
customers. And certainly, we're going to be in very good shape from that standpoint. In terms of turning on the
share repurchase, I think we're going to be in really strong shape from a capital ratio standpoint, even with that
loan growth.
But we continue to look at the interest rate environment and the AOCI and the new Endgame rules whenever they
should happen to come out. We want to make sure we're comfortable from that standpoint. And we have seen the
interest rate environment kind of shift on us in recent months. And the momentum seems to be a little more
upward than backwards, downwards. So, that gives us some pause in terms of turning on the share repurchase.
And we would like to see some stability in interest rates and the overall curve before we turn the share
repurchase back on. So that continues to be the number one factor that we're looking at.

Good morning, Steve.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, everyone. Good morning. So last quarter when the forward curve, I think, had six cuts in it,
Jim, you talked about NIM dipping down to bit in 1Q then a steady climb. I think you said by the end of 2024 we
could get to a NIM that was above the 4Q 2023 level, which was to 2.91%. It sounds now that the NIM will likely
bottom I think you're saying in 2Q. Do you think you could still get up to that 2.91% level by the end of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Hey, good morning, Steve. Yeah, I do. We never give a precise NIM percentage for the reasons I've talked about
in the past. But I will clarify, even though we see the dollars of net interest income troughing in the second quarter
I do think NIM percentage has troughed in the first quarter that we just saw and that's because the balance sheet

will continue to shrink a little bit as we on average have repaid some debt maturities and seeing cash come down.
And again, that's one of the reasons I never offer a precise percentage on NIM percentage...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
...because the two of them have two different answers. But we do see NIM percentage continuing to rise up as we
move through the year. I think we'll be closer to that to 2.90%, quite frankly, in the second quarter. If you exclude
the BSBY impact, you'll see that we're going to have a $3 million BSBY negative impact in the second quarter
compared to the positive $3 million we saw in the first quarter. You'll see that in the BSBY amortization slide. But
excluding that, we do expect to be approaching the 2.90% in the second quarter. And at this point, I would expect
to be near or slightly above 3% by the end of the year. So we are on a very positive trajectory as it relates to both
net interest income dollars and NIM percentage.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yes. That is helpful. It's interesting. The key to all of this seems to be this hockey stick you're talking about of loan
growth coming back in the back half of the year, it's interesting that you look like current GDP is fairly strong. Your
markets in particular, it's fairly strong. You have a general Middle Market balances still declining. And I feel like
we've been down this road before, not only with Comerica, with the industry where pipelines improve, but then we
don't see it translate into actual loan growth. What gives you that confidence like what is going to change with that
economic picture right now versus the second half where you will suddenly see so much more commercial loan
growth in the second half?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Chief Banking Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Steve, it's Peter. I mean, I guess that I would say, prior to the banking crisis, we were seeing pretty good loan
growth across all of our portfolio, particularly in Middle Market. You're right, our geographies, I mean I think the
diversity of our portfolio continues to show really, really well. And in Middle Market, in our geographies, we're
having really good results, believe it or not, in Michigan, in Texas, California is probably the most challenged, but
a lot of our national businesses are not necessarily geographic specific.
And so I think that sort of broad-based regular growth is what we would expect to see across a lot of our
businesses. And we've got different levers that we can pull on how much we want to do in one business at any
one time. And I think we feel really good about the overall trajectory in the second half of the year. So you're right.
I mean, the first quarter came in a little lower than we maybe had expected. But I think what we're seeing in the
pipeline growth and our customer sentiment continues to improve quarter-over-quarter. And so that's what gives
us the confidence that we expect to see that in the second half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. And Peter, do we need to see the fed cutting rates to get this loan growth story moving like if we don't get
rate cut this year, do you – are you guys still confident we'll see that improvement in the second half?

Peter Sefzik A
Chief Banking Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
That's a really good question. I would say that the last 45 days, that's probably a little bit of our factor in sort of
going from 5% to – 4% to 5%, I would say a little bit in some markets, that interest rate issue is bigger than others.
And in some businesses, as I said a little while ago, I think you see that in business banking, I think you see that
in small business. I would say California Middle Market is a little more interest rate sensitive, it seems like than
our other markets. But when you look at kind of our broader specialty businesses, I don't know that the interest
rate outlook is per se a headwind or tailwind really for that space. So again, I think the diversity of the portfolio
gives us some good tailwinds into whatever kind of interest rate environment we're going to see. But I guess I
would say the smaller, in more consumer-oriented businesses, smaller businesses probably have a little bit of an
interest rate headwind to them, but that's not a large, large percentage of our book overall.

Bernard von-Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hey, guys. Good morning. So you introduced the expense recalibration last quarter and I just want to get an
update on the optimization of the real estate footprint and head count reductions. I think head count declined
about 82 versus last quarter. And you noted the remaining will get done in Q2. So how do we think about that $45
million cost savings being realized throughout the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Bernard. It's Jim. We still feel very good about that $45 million. We're very much on track to what
we had expected. Relative to head count, we did recognize some of that change in head count in the first quarter.
Some colleagues have been notified but actually hadn't moved off the payroll yet. So we haven't seen all that
head count reduction yet, but we have seen a piece of it.
There is a much smaller portion of that head count that has been redeployed into other open positions. But we
were expected to fill those positions anyway. And so we will continue to see some attrition of talent just as we
continue to implement the savings ideas, but virtually all colleagues have been notified at this point and we're very
much on track.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
I had mentioned in the last call that we do plan on reinvesting, many of that savings and some of that investment,
a fair amount of it will be in risk management profile and the risk framework, and some of that will entail hiring
colleagues in that space. So you won't necessarily see the same drop on a net basis that we talked about on a
gross basis in the last call. But I would just summarize it to say that we are very much on track with that $45
million that we've talked about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard von-Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay, great. And then just, you've highlighted the nice progress obviously, on reducing that FHLB advances and
brokered deposits. How should we think about the opportunity to further reduce wholesale funding throughout the
rest of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Well, we've – at this point, we've done a large portion of what we plan to do. We don't have any near-term FHLB
maturities. We finished a lot of that up this quarter. And so we don't necessarily want to prepay that and incur the
penalty, so I think we're – where we're going to be in large part of that FHLB borrowings for right now. We do
have a lot of brokered deposits. Most of our brokered deposits on the books do mature this year and we will let
some of those roll off the books permanently and some of those we will roll over.
So it depends on the shape of the balance sheet at that point. We do have a senior debt issuance that matures
later this summer. And depending on the state of the capital markets, we've been love to go out and term out
more of our funding. So that's going to depend on market receptiveness and overall credit spreads. But you're not
going to see as significant of a change in summary, in the remaining nine months as what you've seen in recent
months and what you saw in the first quarter.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
Hey, good morning. So I wanted to ask on deposit, I can see that they're tracking relatively flat across the
commercial bank. But, I think rate expectations move more meaningfully in the back half of the quarter. And
again, more recently after the quarter ended, is there much of a headwind from commercial clients, maybe taking
a look like taking another look at their NIB balances in the higher for longer rate environment? Maybe if you can
talk about, what do you hearing from them, is that something they could do? Or do you think that's pretty much
that move from NIB to IB is pretty much done at this stage?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Sefzik A
Chief Banking Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Manan, it's a good question. This is Peter. I would say overall, we believe that that move from in NIB to IB is over.
But I think you'd probably still have some moving parts to Jim's point if interest rates stay higher for longer, that
conversation probably continues throughout the year. But I don't think it's at the pace that what we saw the last 18
months.
So, what we continue to hear is that our customers are really confident in Comerica. They're really happy with
what we're providing them, products and services for their liquidity. And we feel like the rates that we're putting
out are very competitive. So overall, the feedback that we're getting from our managers and our customers is, I
would tell you, it feels like the answer to that is yes that we think it's over.
But I think particularly in our larger businesses, that's going to be a regular dialogue throughout the year as we
kind of see what the interest rate outlook is. I would remind you though, when you look at the – you talk about the
commercial bank deposits, we've got a very healthy retail bank deposit base, very healthy wealth management
deposit base, both of which have really performed really well lately.
And so I think that when you look at the balance sheet for us, again, the diversity of our deposit base is terribly
powerful on a go forward basis. So there's a lot of levers that we can move when it comes to interest rates and
how we go out and attract deposits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah, appreciate that. Yeah, that didn't go unnoticed. Maybe just shifting over to credit – the NPLs and criticized
assets both increased Q-on-Q. I mean I know you mentioned that the migration should be manageable, but how
much of this is just a normalization in the level of NPAs and criticized assets versus the impact of higher for longer
rates on your borrowers? And also, if you can throw any more light on what you're seeing in specific industries.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Sure. This is Melinda. Thanks, Manan, appreciate the question. Yeah, I would characterize credit overall as being
in really good shape and I know the term normalization has been used a lot over the last couple of quarters, but I
would characterize our movement as definitely in that normalization phase. All of our metrics still are meaningfully
below kind of our long-term average, particularly the nonperforming assets are less than half of what our normal
range would be. So those are very, very well controlled.
The increase in the criticized category this quarter came almost exclusively from a portion of our large corporate
portfolio in – the services Senior Housing space. And so we've been watching this portfolio for a couple of
quarters. As Jim mentioned in his comments, we tend to focus on a newer construction type projects. These are
progressive living type facilities that are very, very appealing to an aging population, but they have elements that's

more real estate oriented, so very sensitive to high interest rates, but it's also an operating business in the
healthcare space. So they've had a lot of labor challenges coming out of COVID.
They've also had a lot of challenges just in getting back to a occupancy level that would allow them to get to
stabilization, impacted again by some of the inflationary pressures. So we – this quarter – over the last couple of
quarters, we've been diving deep into this portfolio. We did a 100% portfolio review and felt like we took a very
appropriately conservative posture around risk rating. We've been in the business for 30 years. We've got very
experienced colleagues on the line credit and our special assets team that is monitoring this portfolio. We have
one nonperforming asset. We have very strong customers and the majority of the portfolio has recourse.
So, I think the – I feel pretty good about what the outcome here is going to be, although headwinds will continue
to be a higher-for-longer rate environment. There's a lot of tailwinds for this space, including an aging population.
The demographic that this portfolio serves would tend to be a little bit more affluent because it is all private pay.
So again, the Senior Housing portfolio was the biggest mover in the quarter. Everything else is actually
performing quite well. I would call Commercial Real Estate very stable. And in fact, if you look in the slides, there's
some positive trends in Commercial Real Estate. Leveraged portfolio is very stable, Automotive is stable, and TLS
always has elevated criticized and losses there have been very manageable. So, I think we'll continue to see
some moderate level of migration, but our reserve levels are very appropriate for where we are in the cycle.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Good morning. I heard your credit is strong or "really good shape." You had lower charge-offs quarter-over-
quarter, criticized loans are below historical, loan loss reserves are flat. And you also added on slide 25, you've
had no big net charge-offs in Commercial Real Estate since 2014. So it's been a decade since anything major.
But I'm just trying to reconcile kind of a good environment today, based on your comments, with the headwinds
from external factors possibly in the future. So specifically, multifamily, what's that, about half of your total
Commercial Real Estate, 60% in California and Texas. And I think some of the issues out there, and correct me if
I'm wrong, but falling rental rates, higher interest rates, higher cap rates, and impending loan maturities. So the
question is, under what scenarios would Comerica feel the need to build reserves on multifamily or other CRE?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Mike, this is Melinda. Thanks for the question. So, let's talk just a little bit about our multifamily portfolio. You're
right, we do have a large portfolio there. We've been in this business for many, many decades. It is a product
category that we specifically leaned into post Great Recession because of its general resiliency. Our underwriting
criteria is very conservative in this space. We are a loan-to-cost lenders. So the amount of equity that goes into
these projects, generally, a 35% to 40%. We are having very successful exits when loans are ready to either
mature or properties are sold. Appraisals, although they are down from what we underwrote, are still well within
guidelines, in fact, below guidelines because of the amount of equity that we have on the front end.
So we are seeing a little bit of softness in rent growth. We underwrite to sensitize rent. So there's a tremendous
amount of leeway within the project. So we have – as you said, we have no criticized assets, we've had no
charge-offs, we have zero delinquencies. Where it's appropriate for exits that the borrower has decided to either
sell the property or move it into long-term financing, there is still that opportunity, plenty of equity in the projects to
make that happen.
So I feel very, very confident. The majority of this portfolio, the vast majority is floating rate. So it's already
absorbed kind of current rates. I mean, if rates were to continue to go up, if we had an upward trajectory, there
would be a little bit more downward pressure. But I don't see a scenario, honestly, where we have losses in this
portfolio, just given who we do business with, how we underwrite and where we stand from a collateral
perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
That's helpful. So when you say the appraisals are down from when you underwrote them, how much are the
appraisals down and what would be kind of a trigger point that would cause some concern?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
Appraisals, the recent appraisals, call it, in the last 90 days or so are down anywhere from 10% to 20%, which,
again, most of our loan-to-values are sub-60%. So we're still well within reasonable guidelines from a loan-to-
value perspective. So we're just not seeing – we're not seeing massive deterioration of value in the multifamily
space. There are some headwinds for multifamily, obviously, there's a lot of supply coming on line, but there's
also tailwinds. I mean, where our projects are tend to be in areas where employment and population growth is

strong. That would be Texas particularly. And again, because of the conservative underwriting, even with rent
growth declining and some amount of – small amount of concessions needed to get these projects to stabilization,
we just don't see any credit deterioration.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And one last pushback, again, you have the track record. You've been in the business decades. You've had a
decade of great performance. But when you said there's no scenarios where you'd have serious losses there, is
that a little bit – do you want to be a little bit more conservative with that statement? Because that seems pretty
strong. I mean, that's a high-level conviction, for sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Melinda A. Chausse A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Comerica, Inc.
So, I think if – if I think about what – if we go into a massive recession, is it possible? Yes, I think we're pretty
confident that the economy is on a reasonably good footing and the outlook for a soft landing is certainly what the
consensus is. So even if rates went up, call it, 50 basis points or 100 basis points, I think this portfolio would still
perform. So, yeah, I'm pretty confident that we're in really good footing. Now with all that said, we do have
reserves on this portfolio and we continue to build the reserve on our commercial loan – Commercial Real Estate
book, just in case, that's why the reserves are there. And so, again, even if we did have some losses we're well
reserved.

So, good morning. Good morning. Jim, I want to go back to the securities comments and you have a couple
comments in the deck. When do we think the security book troughs on a dollar basis, I know you're starting to
reinvest a little bit, but just conceptually, the mix of the balance sheet over the next couple of years, bonds, cash,
loans, loan to deposit, how do we think about this – the ultimate trough of the bond book.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Good morning, Chris. Yeah. Right now we still are carrying a little higher level securities than we typically would.
We do think we're going to get to the point somewhat of a trough, probably, let's call it in the first quarter of next

year give or take, where we will start to reinvest in our MBS portfolio. As we imply in the slides, we are doing
some very minor amounts of treasury reinvestments starting around now. But those are relatively small amounts.
In the past, if you look at our securities as a percentage of the balance sheet, it's going to vary and it should vary
based on the composition of the balance sheet and deposit levels and the types of deposits we have. But in the
past, we've carried securities on the balance sheet anywhere from mid-to-high teens of total assets. I would see
that probably going up a couple percentage points going forward just because we're hearing and putting
ourselves relatively against higher liquidity runoffs just to be that much more conservative, given what we saw
with the regional bank crisis last year and the higher regulatory bar. And so we probably won't carry relative to
history a little higher percentage than we have in the past, but we're still not there quite yet. But I suspect we will
be by the first quarter or so of next year.

My question is – good morning. My question is just on the NII guide, I think a key piece of that was on around the
beta assumptions. So I was wondering if you could provide any color on that and kind of like what are your
assumptions around the down beta compared to the upcycle beta. Thanks.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
James J. Herzog A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Comerica, Inc.
Yeah. Good morning, Zach. Yeah, we actually are assuming in the guide that we stick pretty close to that
sensitivity, [ph] alternate (51:33) sensitivity that we provided on the asset sensitivity slide, which is 60%. And
we're at a cumulative beta, of course, right now 62%. So we would expect initially to go down something close to
the current cumulative beta of 60%. We would expect probably up to a one month lag likely relative to fed cuts.
But I will emphasize that every cycle is a little bit different in terms of how quickly the industry is allowed to cut.
And I continue to say that it depends on, frankly, the reason for the fed cuts, if it's a very orderly take down and it's
a very soft landing, you might see a little bit more delay in those cuts.
And if it's due to some concern in the economy, makes it a lot easier to enforce some of those cuts. So it's going
to really depend on how the overall landscape of the economy lays out and the reason for those cuts. But, we feel
pretty confident that we can get some significant reductions from those customers that most recently pushed the
beta up. And I continue to say that we're on a little bit of a LIFO basis, last in, first out, some of the bigger
increases that we've seen came in the last few months from a beta standpoint. And those will probably be the
easiest ones to push back down since they were closer to that 100% beta level. So anyway, the short answer to
your question is we are assuming a 60% beta on the way down with about a one-month lag.
