Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
Michael George Rhodes
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Sean. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. I'll start by saying I'm so proud to
address you all for the first time as CEO of Ally. I feel privileged to have the opportunity to lead this incredible
company. Now, I want to start by acknowledging the horrific assassination attempt on former President Trump
and the innocent loss of life that occurred over the weekend. Political violence has no place in our democracy and
I hope we can all use this moment to put aside our differences and come together as a country to condemn this
senseless act of violence and commit to peacefully upholding our shared American values.
Now, recognizing there's no easy way to transition from such a serious topic, let's move to slide 4. So I believe
what this team has built and delivered over the years is remarkable. I would like to express my gratitude to the
entire Ally team and the board for placing trust in me to build on that momentum. One of the many things that
excites me about Ally was the strength and scale of our business. We have been in auto finance for more than
100 years and are the largest bank auto finance provider in the US, serving 22,000 dealers and decisioning $400
billion in application volume annually.
On the consumer bank side, it's amazing what we've done in just 15 years. Ally has built the largest all digital
direct bank, serving more than 3 million customers. In fact, Ally was recently named to the top three on TIME
magazine's list of the Best Midsize Companies of 2024 and number one in banking and financial services. I
believe this recognition reaffirms what this team has done here is unique and differentiates our leading franchises
in the marketplace.
A big part of the success of these franchises is our brand. It's one of the most relevant and differentiated brands in
banking. This has allowed us to create strong levels of preference among consumers. None of what this team has
done is possible without a strong culture, and that permeates throughout the organization. Before joining Ally, I
followed the story from a distance. I heard a lot about the culture and that was a key factor in my decision to join.
I learned quickly that everything I heard about the culture was true. The opportunity to lead Ally and do my part to
nurture our culture brings me immense pride. I'm convinced that one of the many things that truly sets Ally apart is
our extraordinary purpose-driven culture centered around our lead core values and our Do It Right approach to
serve customers, communities and employees.
Our culture isn't just a buzzword, it's the backbone of how we operate. It's about integrity, innovation, customer
obsession, and relentless focus on execution. At Ally, we foster an environment where diverse perspectives are
valued. I believe that this is a key driver to our success and that our people are our greatest assets. I've been
fortunate to spend time with many of my teammates and dealer customers in the first two months. My respect for
Ally's legacy has only deepened during that time.
It's clear to me that we are well-positioned to continue creating long-term shareholder value. We have great
market-leading franchises and consistent execution over the past several years has set up a uniquely compelling
financial trajectory. I could not be more thrilled to launch the next chapter of Ally's evolution with my 11,000
teammates. With that, let's turn to slide 5.
As an outsider, I admired Ally's auto business. When I got here, I realized it's even stronger than I appreciated.
Our Auto and Insurance franchises revolves around the dealer and our approach is simple, we help them sell as
many vehicles as possible and be successful in all areas of their business. Our products are comprehensive and
focused on serving our dealer partners. We deliver a differentiated value proposition that is both high-tech and
high-touch.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
We provide vehicle financing to nearly 4 million consumers across the credit spectrum, lending solutions for
dealer inventory and other dealer financing needs as well as specialty offerings. These are unique to Ally such as
SmartAuction and Passthrough products that enhance our overall dealer value proposition. Our Insurance
business is well-established as a leading consumer F&I provider and market-leading provider of commercial P&C
products to help protect dealer businesses.
Our Insurance products are highly complementary to our Auto Finance business. We provide all-in value to our
dealer partners. Insurance has steadily produced over $1 billion in annual written premiums, including $1.3 billion
in 2023. That's the highest since our IPO. Going forward, our Insurance teammates remain focused on leveraging
our broad dealer network to grow our leading position in the marketplace.
As I mentioned, I admire what this team has built over the years. The transformation from captive auto finance
company primarily supporting OEM new vehicle sales to the largest bank auto finance provider in the country has
been deliberate and remarkable. The investment Ally has made over the past decade has resulted in unique
scale, expertise in prime auto and mutually beneficial relationships with our dealer customers.
We have 4,500 teammates across the Auto Finance business with significant resources dedicated to fully serving
our $90 billion consumer portfolio. An experienced collection organization gives us the confidence to underwrite
across the credit spectrum and through the cycle.
On the origination side, we have more than 600 experienced underwriters committed to supporting our dealers
while remaining disciplined on where we put capital to work. And we've made significant investments to
modernize our technology platform, including the core operating system of the Auto Finance business and
ongoing investments in data and analytics. The technology and human capital investments required to win in
prime auto are significant. What this team has built is unique and has driven a remarkable transformation during
our time as a publicly-traded company.
We've grown dealers and applications, resulting in a robust application funnel from which we source origination
volume. We offer quick decision times to the dealer, a skilled team to evaluate and rework transactions where
appropriate, and options for a dealer when a credit doesn't fit our risk appetite. These efforts have led to some of
our most profitable originations we've ever seen and position us well to continue growing our market-leading
position in auto in the years to come.
Let's turn to slide 6 and talk about the bank. Everyone wants to build a digital bank and this team did it better than
anyone. Over the past 15 years, we've earned our customers' trust with leading customer service, consumer-
friendly product offerings including no overdraft fees, and a frictionless all-digital user experience. Our approach
has resulted in an engaged customer base. More than 1 million savings customers engage with core products
and we've consistently grown multiproduct relationships. Providing a comprehensive consumer value proposition
that extends beyond rates and being at the forefront of the shift to consumer preferences has proven to be our
competitive advantage.
Ally Invest and Ally Home are key components to the overall depositor value proposition. Customers are primarily
sourced from existing Ally depositors and we've built a solid foundation focused on strengthening the customer
experience. And Ally Credit Card provides an opportunity to add a floating rate product with attractive returns to
the balance sheet. Our Corporate Finance team is highly respected within the industry and has a long history of
generating compelling returns. In fact, I had the pleasure of celebrating Corporate Finance business's 25th
anniversary in June with the entire team. Fittingly, the team just delivered its highest quarterly earnings ever.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
Our success in Corporate Finance is driven by the same customer-focused approach we deliver across dealer
financial services and our direct consumer products at the bank. We have been a consistent provider of financing
solutions and relentless allies when it comes to helping our partners succeed. As a result, Corporate Finance has
built and maintained mutually beneficial relationships with our customers, the largest of which span decades. It's a
business we're proud of and we expect to continue growing, give us impressive risk-adjusted returns and the
team continues to deliver.
I'm energized by our market-leading position in our two dominant franchises. The opportunity in front of us is
inspiring. Our culture of customer obsession and focused execution position us well for continued success in our
respective markets. Now, let's turn to page 7 to cover second quarter highlights.
Second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.97 and $2 billion in revenue reflect solid financial results from consistent
operational execution. We saw strong improvements following the first quarter earnings trough that we've
messaged for some time. NIM excluding OID of 3.3% is up 14 basis points quarter-over-quarter driven by
momentum on both sides of the balance sheet, and we expect continued expansion from here.
On the capital front, we recently closed our first credit risk transfer transaction, which had strong investor demand
leading to strong pricing and execution. CRT's another tool in our tool kit to generate capital and better serve our
dealer customers. Last month, we received Fed's stress test results. Our preliminary stress capital buffer is 2.6%
effective October 1, 2024. As most of you are aware, we operate with a significant buffer to the SCB.
Moving to operational results, in Auto, we decisioned a Q2 record 3.7 million consumer auto applications and
generated $9.8 billion of originations. Retail auto originated yields of 10.6%, with 44% of the volume in our highest
credit tier. This reflects our strong pricing position and strategic underwriting approach. And 181 points of retail
auto net charge-offs were in line with recent investor guidance at a conference last month. Insurance written
premium of $344 million are up 15% year-over-year, driven by continued momentum in our F&I and P&C
products.
Turning to Ally Bank, deposits were down quarter-over-quarter and flat for the year, in line with our expectations
for seasonal tax outflows. In the quarter, we added 54,000 customers and now have 3.2 million depositors. We
are fully funded with deposits and given our outlook for a largely flat balance sheet, we are well-positioned to
continue leveraging our high-quality deposit portfolio to generate strong returns across our businesses.
We've been very measured on our growth in the Credit Card business, including curtailment actions over the past
18 months. Credit performance in this portfolio is in line with expectations. Corporate Finance balances remain
steady quarter-over-quarter and the portfolio, which is 100% first lien, continue to generate steady returns.
Second quarter ROE was north of 30% and we continue to provide resources to help our team serve our
customers.
We're pleased with the solid financial and operational results this quarter and we remain confident in our ability to
grow earnings from here. And with that, I'll turn it over to Russ.

Russell E. Hutchinson
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Michael. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin on slide 8. In the second quarter, net financing revenue
excluding OID of $1.5 billion was lower year-over-year driven by higher interest rates. Results were up $40 million
quarter-over-quarter as pricing actions on retail deposits drove cost of funds lower, while earning asset yields

continue to expand driven by the strength in fixed rate asset repricing. We expect asset yields to continue
expanding over the medium term as lower yielding assets run off and are replaced by new originations.
Adjusted other revenue of $533 million is up 11% from prior year as we benefit from the momentum within
Insurance and diversified fee revenue from our SmartAuction and Passthrough programs. Provision expense of
$457 million increased from the prior year driven by higher net charge-offs, and was down on a linked quarter
basis as 2Q is the seasonal low point for retail auto NCOs.
Retail auto NCOs were in line with guidance provided at an investor conference last month, decreasing 46 basis
points quarter-over-quarter. Retail auto losses continue to be pressured by the back book, specifically, the 2022
vintage. We expect losses from the 2022 vintage peaked in 2Q and we expect NCOs to moderate in the second
half of 2024 on a seasonally adjusted basis. I'll cover retail auto credit and vintage dynamics in more detail later.
Adjusted non-interest expense of $1.3 billion was up 3% year-over-year, primarily driven by growth in the
Insurance business and historically elevated weather losses, also in Insurance. Controllable non-interest expense
was down more than 1% year-over-year and reflects our continued focus on expense discipline.
Strong EV lease originations drove more than $90 million in EV tax credits within the period, resulting in a
negative tax rate for the quarter. We will provide more on our EV originations and tax implications later. GAAP
and adjusted EPS for the quarter were $0.86 and $0.97, respectively.
Moving to slide 9, net interest margin excluding OID of 3.3% increased 14 basis points quarter-over-quarter, in
line with the guidance provided last month. Earning asset yields expanded 9 basis points quarter-over-quarter,
while funding costs decreased 5 basis points, reflecting strength on both sides of the balance sheet.
As expected, average earning assets are down linked quarter, largely as a result of proactive capital actions
which include the sale of Ally Lending, recent retail auto loan sales, and the continued roll down of mortgage and
securities balances. Lease yields were up 43 basis points quarter-over-quarter driven by an expected increase in
lease termination volume.
On liabilities, cost of funds decreased 5 basis points within the quarter, driven by our pricing actions on deposit
products throughout the first half of the year. The momentum on both sides of our balance sheet is in line with
expectations. Our NIM outlook is unchanged. We expect to exit 2024 near 3.5% and continue the march to 4%
NIM as our lower-yielding back book continues to be replaced by higher-yielding originations. And as we've said
before, our 2024 exit rate is not dependent on Fed rate cuts. We expect a 4% NIM run rate to be reached by the
end of 2025 in a range of rate scenarios.
Slide 10 provides a look at the evolution of Ally's consumer deposits. We are pleased with the strength of the
deposit franchise. Retail deposits across all vintages since the inception of Ally Bank have been stable or grown,
reflecting a consistent retention rate above 95%. We have steadily grown customers by offering a comprehensive
value proposition that includes attractive deposit rates, our award-winning digital platform, high service levels, and
our range of no-fee products.
And our customer growth continued in the second quarter. We added 54,000 deposit customers in the quarter,
and are now relentless allies with 3.2 million customers. As expected, deposit balances declined by $3 billion
during the quarter to land flat for the first half of the year. The decline in balances in the second quarter was
driven by seasonality related to tax payments that was anticipated.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
The transformation of the bank over the past 15 years has positioned Ally to optimize for sustainable earnings
moving forward. Our balance sheet is fully funded with deposits and the $142 billion deposit portfolio is 90% FDIC
insured. We continue to target approximately flat deposit balances for the remainder of the year, based on our
balance sheet growth trajectory.
Turning to page 11. CET1 of 9.6% increased quarter-over-quarter. We operate with a significant buffer to required
CET1 minimums, with $4 billion of excess capital above our preliminary SCB minimum. As you know, our
preliminary SCB is up 10 basis points to 2.6% following this year's Fed run stress test. Given the size of our buffer
and the modest increase, this change in SCB does not impact the way we're managing capital.
Within the quarter, we issued $330 million in credit-linked notes against the $3 billion reference pool of prime auto
loans that generated 11 basis points of CET1 benefit at closing. We were pleased with the execution and I will
touch on credit risk transfer in more detail on the next slide. We recently announced our quarterly dividend of
$0.30 for the third quarter, which remains consistent with the prior quarter.
On the bottom of the slide, you can see the trend of tangible book value over time. Excluding the temporary
impact of OCI, we closed the quarter with adjusted tangible book value of $47. With the earnings trajectory in front
of us, and the natural pull to par on the securities portfolio, we're confident in our ability to drive solid book value
growth over the next several years.
On slide 12, we provide details on our first credit risk transfer transaction. Ally has a long history in the
securitization market with an established infrastructure and investor base, which supported our success in pricing
and overall execution. In conjunction with the transaction, we issued $330 million of credit-linked notes with a
coupon just over 7%. That is partially offset by our investment income on a corresponding cash collateral account.
The transaction reduces RWA on the reference portfolio of $3 billion of prime retail auto loans from 100% to 38%,
and introduces another lever for dynamic capital management. While we meaningfully reduced the risk weighting
on the pool, we retain 100% of the economics on the assets, and the net cost of the mezzanine notes equates to
less than 0.5 basis point of NIM. The transaction increased CET1 by 11 basis points at closing, and given the
amortizing nature of the underlying assets, the capital benefit will amortize as the loans pay down.
The CRT is another indication of strong market appetite for our loans and our ability to reduce RWA to free up
capital. Consistent with how we use other capital management levers, we'll remain opportunistic in the CRT space
going forward.
Let's turn to slide 13 to review asset quality trends. The consolidated net charge-off rate of 126 basis points was
down quarter-over-quarter, reflecting typical seasonality. Our commercial portfolios continue to demonstrate solid
credit performance, with no net charge-off activity in Corporate Finance and a net recovery in commercial auto.
The credit card portfolio is performing in line with expectations, and the net charge-off rate of 12.6% is consistent
with the prior quarter.
Based on what we are seeing in terms of delinquency, we believe credit card NCOs have peaked in line with the
guidance we provided in December. Retail auto net charge-offs of 181 basis points were down 46 basis points
quarter-over-quarter.
In the bottom right, 30-plus day delinquencies increased 45 basis points quarter-over-quarter due to seasonality
and were up 73 basis points on a year-over-year basis. The second quarter closed on a weekend, and as we
talked about last quarter that does have an impact on the spot delinquency rate we report externally.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
Looking throughout the month of June, the average delinquency rate was up less than 60 basis points on a year-
over-year basis. Delinquencies will increase through the second half of 2024 in line with seasonal patterns, but we
expect the year-over-year increase to moderate further. I'll cover retail auto credit trends in more detail on a
couple of slides.
Consolidated coverage was flat quarter-over-quarter, and total reserves remained steady at $3.6 billion. Retail
auto coverage was unchanged at 365 basis points. Our base case continues to assume no change in the retail
auto coverage rate. Corporate Finance continues to demonstrate solid credit performance and had no new
nonperforming loans in the quarter. We expect consistency in the coverage rates across the portfolio near term,
barring any shifts in the macro environment.
On slide 15, we provide further detail around retail auto credit. Retail NCOs of 181 basis points were consistent
with the preview provided in early June, but roughly 10 basis points higher than our expectations entering the
quarter. The current pressure on NCOs continues to come from the back book, particularly the 2022 vintage,
which accounted for 42% of retail auto NCOs in the first half of the year. That vintage has moved past the typical
point of peak loss for a vintage and will be a smaller contributor to losses going forward. The majority of our
prospective loss content will be driven by vintages originated in 2023 and later.
Given the meaningful shift up in credit in the second quarter of 2023, more specifically, the increase in our S-tier
credit mix for the past year, we expect loss content to be lower in the front book than what we've seen on the
2022 vintage. And we continue to see signs of that favorable performance when we compare delinquency rates of
those two vintages at various months on book.
After 18 months on book, the 2023 vintage has a 30-day delinquency rate that's 35 basis points below the 2022
vintage. That gap narrowed slightly from three months ago, but we don't expect it to be a straight line. Given the
day-of-the-week dynamics I touched on earlier, we've provided this chart using averages throughout the month,
which we think is a more accurate view of delinquency.
The traditional spot DQ comparison has also been provided. Delinquency is a key metric we use to assess
expected loss content, but there are other factors that give us confidence new originations will produce lower
losses than the 2022 vintage. We expect the front book to outperform from a flow to loss rate perspective given
the increasing credit quality across borrower dimensions like FICO and PTI. And we expect less severity pressure
given the front book was underwritten below the peak in collateral values and with lower LTVs.
On collateral values, we've seen a 3% decline on a year-to-date basis and we're anticipating another 2% decline
for the remainder of the year. The total change of 5% on a full year basis is unchanged from what we've provided
in January. Putting all the moving pieces together, we remain confident that our underwriting changes and shift in
mix have resulted in a front book that will produce lower losses going forward.
Turning to slide 16, we've provided an update on trends we're seeing in electric vehicles. EV originations in the
second quarter of $1 billion represented 10% of our total 2Q origination volume. Increased volume in the lease
channel has been concentrated in battery electric vehicles as we entered into a new OEM agreement in March.
Importantly, virtually all of our battery electric vehicle lease contracts come with residual guarantees from the
OEM that provide significant protection against declines in value.
While the expected economics of an EV lease are identical to an internal combustion engine vehicle, there are
some nuances that impact the timing and geography of the earnings stream. As the owner of leased vehicles, Ally
is entitled to the tax credit associated with the transaction. We pass that benefit to the customer in the form of a

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
lower monthly payment, reducing net interest income. Ally gets the full benefit of the tax credit, which flows
through the income statement as a reduction in tax expense. So, while the economics of EV and traditional
internal combustion or ICE leases are unchanged, EV leases drive accelerated income through the tax line that is
offset by lower net interest income over the full life of the lease.
Given the size of our originations in the quarter, that resulted in current tax benefits of approximately $92 million
and reduced the tax rate by approximately 35 percentage points. Relative to traditional lease volume, that creates
a modest NIM headwind going forward. We'll talk more about the financial outlook shortly, but we expect the
momentum we've seen in EV leasing to result in a negative tax rate for the year, but the lower revenue associated
with EV lease is not material enough to change our 2024 NIM outlook.
Stepping back from the accounting dynamics, this increase in volume is another example of how our auto
business is well-positioned for an evolving auto landscape. We're pleased with the risk-adjusted returns we're
getting in the channel, particularly with the residual value protection we have in place.
Moving to slide 17 to review the auto segment highlights. Pre-tax income of $407 million was down from the prior
year, driven by higher funding cost, provision expense, and noninterest expense. Provision expense was primarily
driven by elevated losses from the 2022 vintage. Noninterest expense was also up year-over-year as servicing-
related costs increased in connection with elevated loss content.
On the origination side, we continue to benefit from the strength and scale of our Auto Finance franchise. Robust
application volume enabled us to sustain pricing while originating 44% of our retail auto loan volume in our
highest credit tier. Average FICO of 712 is up from prior period and the highest in over a decade. Retail auto
originated yield of 10.59% was down quarter-over-quarter, driven entirely by changes in mix, as our pricing
remained very consistent across the credit spectrum. Portfolio yields continue to migrate towards originated
yields. Excluding the impact from hedges, yields are up 21 basis points quarter-over-quarter as newer vintages
make up a larger portion of the portfolio. Portfolio yields, including hedges, are on track for 9.5% by year-end,
consistent with prior expectations.
Lease trends are in the bottom right. Gains of $59 million in the second quarter reflect higher lease termination
volume. Terminations do have seasonality as we see elevated activity in the second quarter each year. And
termination volume is also impacted by how many contracts we wrote three years ago, given our average lease
term. So, results this quarter certainly had seasonality, but we also saw the impact of elevated lease volume in
the first half of 2021.
Lease volume was very strong in the industry and our 2Q 2021 volume was a high watermark. Since that time,
volumes have slowed, and as a result, we expect lower termination volumes going forward. Lower units,
combined with continued normalization of used values, will reduce lease gains for the remainder of 2024. The
lease termination and gain dynamics are a key reason we've guided to a range of 5 to 15 basis points of quarterly
NIM expansion for 2024 rather than a straight line.
Turning to Insurance on slide 18. We recorded a pre-tax loss of $14 million, as higher weather losses more than
offset strong growth in premium and investment revenue. Total written premiums of $344 million increased 15%
year-over-year. We continue to see great momentum across the business. Increased losses on a linked-quarter
and year-over-year basis were driven by weather activity. We saw the most active weather loss season in over a
decade, including the most severe hail activity in the past 20 years.

Our reinsurance program materially reduced our net exposure within the quarter. The team has been actively
monitoring the impacts of Hurricane Beryl. While claim activity can be filed on a lag, we do not expect any
material losses associated with the storm, another example of the team's ability to help dealers minimize loss for
named storms. Our focus in Insurance remains on leveraging relationships in Auto Finance and growing earned
premiums over time, a key driver of our fee revenue expansion.
Corporate Finance results are on slide 19. Core pre-tax income of $98 million is a record for Corporate Finance
and demonstrates another quarter of steady returns with a 2Q ROE of 34%. End-of-period HFI loans decreased
quarter-over-quarter as favorable capital markets conditions, including a strong CLO market, led to elevated
payoffs. Our portfolio remains well-diversified and is virtually all first lien. And we will remain well-positioned from
a credit standpoint with criticized assets and nonaccrual loans near historic lows and limited commercial real
estate exposure.
On the bottom of the page, we highlight the return since our IPO. Corporate Finance remains a steady and
meaningful contributor to Ally's earnings profile with an average return on equity of 22% since 2014. Our success
is driven by a relentless focus on our customers, through-the-cycle lending approach and mutually beneficial
sponsor relationships. While balances can be choppy quarter-to-quarter, we're committed to serving our
customers and being disciplined about deploying capital. And, over time, this is a business we'll continue to
prudently grow.
Turning to Mortgage on slide 20. Mortgage generated pre-tax income of $27 million and $261 million of DTC
originations. Held-for-investment assets continued to decrease as we continue to allocate resources to our
highest-returning businesses. We remain committed to providing a best-in-class digital experience and driving
operational efficiency within the business. I will provide an update on our 2024 outlook before heading into Q&A.
In terms of net interest margin, second quarter represented an inflection point and natural portfolio rollover will
drive expansion from here with or without rate cuts. We see third quarter expansion at the low end of our 5 to 15
basis point quarterly range given lease dynamics I talked about and expect to exit the year between 3.45% and
3.50%, resulting in a full year NIM of about 330 basis points.
So, relative to our last earnings call, we're increasing to the high end of our NIM guide. Similarly, we expect
adjusted other revenue to be at the top of the range provided last quarter, increasing 12% year-over-year.
Momentum within Insurance, P&C earned premiums through recent OEM relationships, and continued
momentum in our other revenue streams more broadly gives us confidence in the revised outlook. We have
narrowed the range of our expected consolidated loss rate to 1.45% to 1.5%, and we now see retail auto NCOs of
approximately 2.1%.
As I noted earlier, we continue to see pressure from the 2022 vintage but we remain pleased with what we're
seeing in the front book, which will be the largest driver of losses beyond 2024. Adjusted noninterest expense
guidance is unchanged with controllable expenses expected to be down more than 1% year-over-year and total
up less than 2%. We now expect average earning assets to be down 1% this year, reflecting the cumulative
impact of all of the actions we've taken to manage RWA and capital levels in anticipation of regulatory changes.
Last several quarters, we've deconsolidated $2.8 billion of lower-yielding retail auto loans, sold our point-of-sale
lending business and its $2 billion portfolio, and executed a credit risk transfer to create excess capital. These
actions not only create incremental capital, but also improve overall returns. On tax rate, we've adjusted our full
year guidance to a range of 0% to negative 5%, based on our outlook for EV lease volume in the back half of the
year.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
To wrap, this was a solid quarter in terms of operational execution and financial results, and we remain confident
in achieving a 4% NIM, $6 of EPS, and mid-teens return run rate by the end of 2025.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Sean for Q&A.

Sean Leary
Head-Investor Relations & Enterprise FP&A, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Russ. As we head into Q&A, we do ask that participants limit yourself to one question and one follow-
up. Elizabeth, please begin the Q&A.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning, everyone. So, Michael, you highlighted you've been in the role for about two months. Maybe
just give us your initial impressions of the company and the strategy. And as you think about the strategy this
company has pursued, any initial thoughts on potential changes to the strategy or the direction of the company?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael George Rhodes A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
So, Ryan, thanks for the question and nice to chat. So, as you mentioned, in the prepared remarks, I said a
couple of things, really reflect the fact how grateful I am to have inherited such a well-respected and well-
positioned company, and really a tremendous respect for what the team has built. And one of the things that really
drew me to Ally was the evolution we've had over the past many years, and I should underscore how well-
positioned we are for where banking is heading in the future.
And as you know, we talked about strategy as a CEO, an important part of my job is to constantly think about and
evolve the strategy. But, right now, my primary focus is to execute the plans we have in place. I am incredibly
fortunate to be walking into a situation with a strong several years ahead of us, and believe we're uniquely
positioned in our industry with a very attractive earnings ramp. And so, it's very important to me that we execute.
And so, I just want to underscore that, that I'm very much focused on execution.
Now, don't read this that we're on autopilot. Rather, we'll continue to optimize our use of capital and we will take a
hard look at everything. Just don't expect any significant near-term shifts [ph] as we get some way that we do it
(00:38:04).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. Maybe a question for Russ regarding credit. Russ, you gave a lot of color on credit regarding performance.
You talked about lower front book performance. I guess, given the tighter underwriting, the burn off of 2022, which
you showed on slide 15, and then the stronger 2026, I think you highlighted moderating – losses moderating on a
seasonal basis. But when do you think we start to see credit outperform seasonal expectations given all the

changes, then move up market? And can we make significant progress toward the 1.8% targeted charge-off level
in 2025? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. Hutchinson A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, no, thanks for the question, Ryan. Great to be on with you again. Look, okay, I think, as you think about
kind of seasonal trends, as we highlighted, second quarter is a seasonal trough. And so, our expectation is to see
kind of typical increase in NCOs over the remainder of this year as we go into third and fourth quarter. That being
said, that that kind of typical seasonal increase, we expect to be mitigated, as you pointed out, as that 2022
vintage has passed peak loss period and really starts to burn off. And so, we do expect some mitigation in the
normal seasonal increase that we'd see going into third and fourth quarter. And obviously our expectation is that
continues into 2025.
We're not providing guidance on 2025 NCOs yet. As usual, we'll kind of work through the remainder of the year
and look to provide that kind of guidance early next year. That being said, we do, as you pointed out, expect to
make progress towards NCOs that we think, over the kind of the medium term, auto settle out somewhere in call it
1.6% to 1.8% range based on kind of how we're underwriting today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Our next question comes from a line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning and, Michael, congratulations on your first call. Maybe just to follow-up on Ryan's
questions. Maybe, Michael, you could just talk about your opinion on the strategy of the company and sort of
being a monoline in auto. There's always been ideas to diversify into card. You obviously have a background
there. Can you just talk about philosophically like how you think about the composition of the asset base and sort
of the strategy going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael George Rhodes A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, no, thanks for the question and great question. So, coming in the role, I've obviously followed out Ally from
the outside and now being in the role, one of the questions you always have to ask yourself from a high-level
strategy is where are we going to compete and how are we going to win?
And in terms of where we're going to compete, we do find that the – I do find that the auto business is a very
attractive ecosystem for us. And I think ecosystem because it's more than just the consumer loans. We have
commercial lending to the dealers. We have Insurance product. We have some value-added services such as the
Passthrough programs, the SmartAuction. And so like we really have a compelling reason why we can win in the
auto space. And so, as you can imagine that that's – we want to double down on where you have a real reason to
win. And so, if you look at that and I'm just very pleased with where we are.
And then clearly, on the banking side of the business, what we've done with deposits is really quite remarkable.
Again, I said in my prepared comments, everybody wants to build a digital bank and we've done that better than

anyone, and that's great. And we've had some places where our diversification is really taking hold. I mean, you
see the commercial finance business and what that's done.
And then we have some emerging opportunities here. And you can see that we're being a little more slow in terms
of what we're trying to do in those emerging opportunities because the best use of capital right now is really in the
things that we do very well and have defensible reasons to win. And that's where you're going to see us allocating
our expenses and our capital in the near term.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, great. And then apologies if I missed this, but maybe, Russ, if you could just talk about the originated yield.
I know it declined because of the mix and you guys went up more up market, but was there anything else from a
competitive standpoint that was affecting that originated yield or is it simply just mix?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. Hutchinson A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
No, it's simply just mix. And, look, mix will vary on a quarter-to-quarter basis. I don't think we're looking at this as
any kind of a long-term trend. Our pricing was consistent across credit tiers. And we got hit to a higher quality
credit mix. This time, you see it most clearly obviously in the high percentage of the S-tier, but you also see it
more broadly with the FICO moving up to 712 for this quarter's origination. So, it's really just kind of normal
fluctuations and, again, we're not reading anything into it at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Thank you.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to clarify, Russ, I think you talked about the year-over-year delinquency 30-plus
day moderating going forward. Is that versus the 60 basis points or the 73 basis points perhaps, just want to
clarify that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. Hutchinson A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Great. No, I appreciate the clarification. The 73 basis points is kind of based on the end-of-quarter delinquencies.
And so, as we've pointed out earlier and we pointed this out last quarter as well, the day of the week has an
impact on overall delinquency levels. That is to say, over the course of a typical week, we see kind of different
outcomes for delinquency. So, we typically get our kind of lower delinquencies on Fridays and higher
delinquencies on Sundays. This quarter ended on a Sunday. The comparative quarter ended on a Friday. And so,
that was, in a sense, a bad guy in terms of that overall measure of delinquency.
When we look at it on a daily average basis, that 73-basis-point delta based on the last day of the quarter is more
like 60 basis points on a daily average basis. And so, you kind of get a kind of a more kind of a steady-state
13

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
reflection of the delinquency trends as you compare the two months, this month and – sorry, this quarter and the
quarter a year ago. And so, that's a little bit more kind of context on the 60 basis points and the 73 basis points.
I think kind of – given we've now had two quarters where we've had to talk about this day-of-the-week
phenomenon, I think you will see us, going forward, talk a little bit more about daily averages, where it's
applicable. That being said, of course, we know the industry and a lot of the reporting we do is on a kind of daily
kind of end-of-the-quarter basis, and so that's going to continue. But we'll try to provide a little bit more insight on
the daily average basis just to – basically just to mute that that day-of-the-week impact that we've been seeing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So, I guess we should think about you'd said it could moderate further. Would that be from like that 73 or 60 bps?
Like just trying to think because the 60 basis points was better than last quarter on a year-over-year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. Hutchinson A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, that's right. And so, I think our expectation is moderating, not necessarily in a straight line, but moderating
overall. And so, yes, we do expect to see continued moderation both in terms of the last day of the quarter as well
as the daily average. The only thing I'd point out is there is that kind of embedded volatility in the last day of the
quarter depending on which specific day of the week it falls on relative to the base quarter you're comparing it to.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with TD Cowen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, TD Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks. Hoping that you guys – that maybe, Russ, you could talk a little bit about the outperformance of
the 2023 vintage versus 2022. How much do you think of that as being driven by kind of industry performance?
How much of it is Ally? And then can you relate to that what you talked about in terms of seeing kind of tighter
underwriting for a lot of the period in 2023 and early 2024, and maybe some of those other factors that you talked
about as to how do we can think about that even as we go forward into the 2024 vintage?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. Hutchinson A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Sure. So, maybe I'll start with kind of the first question, the first part of your question, us versus the industry. And I
think probably kind of I think the clearest and most definitive way to look at it is I'll start maybe with the industry.
When you look at the trajectory of car prices, both kind of where dealers were selling and where MSRPs were
going as well as the used car prices, they really peaked in 2022. And so, from an industry perspective, we all kind
of get a tailwind from the fact that 2023 going forward were written – loans and leases were basically underwritten
14

at less than peak prices for both new and used vehicles. And so, I think that's helpful for us. It's helpful for the
industry.
Flipping gears and just talking about Ally specifically, we've been making – we've been tightening our underwriting
consistently over the course of – over the past – more than the past year. But in particular, you see it as you go
from first quarter of 2023 to second quarter of 2023. And that's where you really saw that step up in the proportion
of our originations that are in our top credit tier, the S-tier. And so I'd say from Q2 2023 onwards, you really see a
change in terms of our overall underwriting, and that's for us – obviously that's very much Ally specific. But that's
what I would point to as kind of the Ally-specific part in terms of the change in the way we've underwritten.
You see it most clearly in that percentage of S-tier, but you also see it kind of overall in just the overall way that
we've underwritten. We've effectively taken a microscope to our originations, looking at our performance on a very
discrete level, looking at vintages, and then looking at cuts within those vintages to understand how kind of
various subsegments are performing, and then calling underperforming segments and adjusting pricing as we
move forward. And so that, again, a lot of that kicked in the second quarter of 2023. And that's really where we
attribute a large chunk of the improvement in what we're seeing in the 2023 and forward vintages versus 2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, TD Securities (USA) LLC
Got it. Thanks. And maybe as kind of the follow-up question, and, Michael, wanted to add my welcome and
congratulations. So, just to talk a little bit about capital maybe and thoughts about capital levels. I saw the CRT,
but maybe given that the financial markets have been better, could you talk about the appetite for actual loan
sales or securitization and sales of loans and how you would think about that in terms of managing the – both
capital levels and origination levels into the back half of the year and into 2025?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. Hutchinson A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, maybe I'll start and Michael can kind of add to it. We have been very pleased with the market's receptivity
to our loans. It's given us additional levers that we can use in terms of managing our overall capital levels. And so
you've seen obviously the CRT, the reception on the CRT was fantastic. I think we were very pleased with the
outcome both in terms of pricing, in terms of size, in terms of the overall market demand for it.
You also saw us earlier in the first half and late last year in the ABS market actually selling deeper into the
residuals of our ABS in order to get deconsolidation of loans. So we'd sold about $2.8 billion of loans through the
ABS markets as well, so another example of capital market's receptivity to our loans. And so we've been very
pleased with that. We think that these capital levers give us additional flexibility that will allow us to both support
our dealers and then, ultimately, return capital to our shareholders.
As we said before and as you know very well, we continue to be very focused on capital build for now in
anticipation of the new B3 capital rules that we expect at some point.

Moshe – and, Moshe, this is Michael, great to chat with you again. It's been a while, but being the new guy in here
and just kind of seeing what we have, we have several very attractive tools that Russ has covered, and we are in
a bit of a wait and see mode as it relates to Basel and kind of what's going to happen there. But I'd say that we'd
be very opportunistic and we've got the appropriate tools and we're being very thoughtful about how we allocate
our capital certainly now and then as we go forward.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Adelson with Morgan Stanley.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Adelson Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to circle back on the credit a little bit. I know there a bit of a
timing issue on the spot rate, but if we look at the 60-plus days, the second derivative there does continue to
shrink. So just wondering, is that something that does give you more confidence in the outlook for your charge-off
trajectory from here?
And then as we think about the spot rate dynamic here, the weekend timing, next quarter, I'm sitting here looking
at my calendar, does end on a Monday, so is that something that could potentially help you guys next quarter,
reverse some of that spot dynamic you've been seeing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. Hutchinson A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, no, great questions, Jeff, and thanks and great to speak with you again. I'd say first, I think your
observation on the 30-plus versus the 60-plus is very astute. And I'd say just more broadly, we continue to see
very favorable trends in flow to loss, And that's – and part of that, we believe, is some of the changes that we've
made both on the underwriting that we talked about earlier but also on the servicing side in terms of just making
improvements to our overall servicing model to give our collectors a little bit more time to work the credits and to
give our customers a little bit more time to correct.
And so agree with you that as we just look at the overall book, as we look at flow to loss trends, all those things
are things that again give us confidence in terms of the credit outlook going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Adelson Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay, great. And then as my follow-up, just tax rate, I mean, is there any reason why we shouldn't start thinking
about this negative or really low tax rate as kind of the new norm here? I mean, it's starting to feel like this could
be a more of a recurring ongoing benefit even beyond 2024. Is there any reason why that might not be the case?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. Hutchinson A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Jeff, another great question, I'm glad you asked it. You look at the quarter and as we pointed out, a lot of the EV
lease volume was driven by an OEM relationship that we entered into in March. And so really this was the first
quarter where we had a full quarter of origination under this program.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 17-Jul-2024
And we did, obviously, as you saw, just over $600 million of lease EV originations during the quarter. Obviously,
we're pleased with that level of origination, but again it's – a large chunk of that was driven by new agreement.
There'll naturally be kind of ebbs and flows in that. I wouldn't necessarily count on that specific level of volume
each quarter, but certainly our expectation is that we're going to continue to originate these EV leases [ph] in size
(00:55:50).
And it's certainly our expectation that that's going to continue, obviously, through the remainder of 2024, driving
down to the revised tax rate guidance we provided, and that will also continue somewhat over the course of 2025.
I would just like to reiterate, while we're talking about the EV leases, the accounting for these leases, as we
pointed out, using this – the flow through method has the impact of – kind of impacting NIM to the negative. We've
considered that and, obviously, every quarter that we continue to do these EV leases, there's more kind of
downward pressure on NIM.
We've anticipated that downward pressure and again we remain confident in the NIM guidance that we've
provided in terms of the exit rate for 2024, and then ultimately getting to a 4% NIM run rate at the end of 2025.
And again, that's with the headwind of these EV leases.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks, guys, for taking my questions. Hey, Michael, welcome and congratulations and I share your hope in
terms of what you set up front. Look, I'd like to talk a little bit more about the EV originations and the residual
guarantees. I'm curious if there is a differential between your residual assumption and the guarantee level and if
that could impact NIM over time?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael George Rhodes A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yes, that's a good question. I'd say, maybe just to start, but the residual value guarantee provides real protection
against the decline in values. You probably noticed in our Q for the first quarter, we actually did provide a little bit
more discussion around this, [ph] a agreement (00:58:00) we've entered in March, and so there's a bit of more
description around that residual value protection.
That being said, as you think about lease gains on this particular portfolio going forward, we do expect them to be
muted. But again it's early days in terms of this agreement, and as we mentioned earlier, overall, we do have an
expectation of second quarter, the lease gains we saw were obviously driven by just a seasonality as well as the
– just the level of origination, lease originations we did three years ago back in the second quarter of 2021.
And our expectation, that lease terminations decline throughout the remainder this year as well as 2025 and so,
obviously, that has an impact on lease gains going forward. And again that is something that we've anticipated
and we've baked into our guidance around net interest margin going forward for 2024 and 2025.

Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Look, the reason the residual guarantees on battery – EV battery cars is so important is because of the
rapid evolution of the technology and the rapid obsolescence of prior cars. I'm curious if the OEM partnership also
is driving and increasing your mix of loan volume for battery-powered EVs and if that's something that we need to
think about in terms of residual values on a long-term basis as well in terms of recoveries?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael George Rhodes A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
I think the agreement is more focused around lease since I'd say it's certainly driving our origination of battery
electric vehicle leases. I don't believe it's having any meaningful impact on our retail lending overall. I would point
out, when we think about electric vehicles, obviously, we have a balance of hybrid electric as well as battery
electric, and the residual value performance on the hybrid electric is obviously quite a bit different versus the pure
battery electric vehicles.
And a lot of our volume is driven by the battery electric side, particularly when you look at the leased product and
outside of this OEM relationship.

Operator: Our last question today will come from Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Wildhack Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Morning, guys. We noticed that you took CD pricing up in at least a couple of the products during the quarter.
Wondering if there's anything to read into there on your ability to continue to push deposit costs lower? And then
what kind of deposit repricing are you baking into the expectation to exit the year with that 3.45% to 3.5% NIM?
And then same question, too, for the 4% in 2025 as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. Hutchinson A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Sure. Yeah, we have made selective changes to CD pricing. It's just basically a reaction to kind of specific
conditions as well as just looking at that kind of specific CD maturities in terms of just kind of managing our overall
CD maturity profile. All that being said, we don't anticipate any kind of broad changes to deposit pricing from
where we are in advance of any moves by the Federal Reserve.
As we've said before, as we think about just overall, our NIM trajectory for 2024, obviously, the deposit pricing will
depend to some extent on Fed rate moves but our NIM trajectory does not. And that is to say that we believe that
we've put hedging in place and we've managed our risk in such a way that our 2024 exit rate does not depend or
rely upon Fed rate cuts.
Similarly, as we look at 2025 and we look at our guidance to get to 4% NIM at the end of 2025, again, we've
looked at that under a variety of rate scenarios, and as you could imagine, our deposit pricing depends on, to
some extent, kind of broader moves in rates by the Fed. And again, looking at a broad range of scenarios, we feel

comfortable based on our hedging, based our overall asset mix between floating and fixed that we can hit the 4%

Okay, thanks. And then just one more. Appreciate the color on the credit risk transfer. Curious how big a tool you
think this could be for Ally going forward? Is it something you'd expect to do frequently to the extent that the
market appetite is there, or should we think of these as more one-off type transactions?

There's certainly an opportunistic nature to them. That being said, we were very pleased with market appetite and
demand, and so it's definitely a tool that we want to use. And so I think our expectation is that we'll continue to
use it. You'll see us print these from time to time. I certainly wouldn't expect them every quarter but it's certainly a
tool that we expect to reuse.
