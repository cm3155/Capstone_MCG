Ellen A. Taylor
Head-Investor Relations, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Hi, everyone. First, it's Ellen Taylor, I've got to do a little housekeeping. Thanks so much for joining us this
morning. We really greatly appreciate your support and interest. To start things off, our CEO, Bryan Jordan; and
CFO, BJ Losch will provide opening comments and an overview of our results. And then, of course, we'll be
happy to take your questions.
We're also pleased to have with us today our Chief Operating Officer, Anthony Restel, who will be taking on the
role of interim CFO; and our Chief Credit Officer, Susan Springfield. Our remarks today are going to reference the
earnings presentation which you may find at ir.fhnc.com. As always, I need to remind you that we will make
forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. And we ask that you review the factors that
may cause our results to differ from our expectations which you can find on page 2 of our presentation and in our
SEC filings.
We also will address adjusted results which exclude the impact of notable items. You should understand that
these are non-GAAP measures. So, it's really important for you to review the GAAP information in our earnings
release and on page 3 of our presentation. And then, of course, last but not least, our comments reflect our
current views, and you should understand that we aren't obligated to update them.
And now, with that, I'll give it to Bryan.

D. Bryan Jordan
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Thank you, Ellen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'm proud of the First Horizon team
as we continue to deliver solid performance. The economy continues to strengthen, loan demand and activity is
continuing to build, and our strong credit quality is performing well.
Liquidity and cash levels are strong broadly in the economy, which is leading the higher loan payoffs, more
competition for new lending opportunities and compressing loan spreads. Our diversified business model
including mortgage banking, mortgage warehouse lending and FHN Financial continue to provide an effective
offset to some of these headwinds.
We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.58 with a return on tangible common equity of 22% in the quarter. Our capital
levels remain healthy with a common equity Tier 1 ratio at 10.33%, and we grew tangible book value per share by
4% in the quarter to $10.74. Our revenues this quarter were down from strong first quarter levels. FHN Financial
and Mortgage remain strong but also with extraordinarily strong first quarter levels.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2021
Our results this quarter were bolstered by the impact of continued rapid improvement in the overall economy and
asset quality which resulted in a provision credit of $115 million. We're encouraged by the uptick in activity across
franchise as markets and sectors reopened. Our associates are having lots of constructive dialogue with clients
and prospects, and we feel we're at a relatively strong position to benefit from further economic improvement.
Loan pipeline certainly continue to reflect the strengthening economy in May and June. Still near term, the
industry is confronting continued lower rates, high levels of excess liquidity, and very little incremental loan
demand. Clients are still cautious about new investments and are still facing supply chain and labor force
constraints that are problematic.
We are also starting to see PPP loan forgiveness pick up. All of these translates to a fiercely competitive
landscape for loan outstandings.
We are continuing to focus on controlling the things that we can control, driving toward completing our merger
integration, capturing revenue synergies, being good risk managers, all while focusing on serving our clients and
anticipating their needs. We continue to do a great job of capturing revenue synergies across the markets and
product lines by leveraging our expanding suite of products, services, and expertise, all instrumental in retaining
and growing our client relationships.
At the same time, we are committed to continuing to drive enhanced efficiency by delivering $200 million in cost
savings and controlling cost while still making prudent investments in technology and products to drive future
revenue growth.
We also continue to opportunistically deploy capital through share repurchases. We bought back 3.1 million
shares this quarter. Including dividends, we returned a total of $141 million of capital through our common
shareholders.
We continue to be optimistic about the path of the economic recovery and the increased activity levels we are
seeing across our footprint as our markets continue to reopen. But like many, we are keeping a watchful eye on
supply chain and labor constraints as well as signs of inflation. I continue to be highly confident that our business
model and benefits of the merger of equals position us well to deliver top quartile return over the medium term.
And now, I'll turn it over to BJ for some comments on the results. BJ?

William C. Losch III
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Thanks, Bryan. Good morning, everybody. Let's start off on slide 6. As Bryan mentioned, we're really pleased with
the continued execution in the first half of the year. The merger is delivering the enhanced efficiencies that we
expected and we're capturing the benefits of the merger savings and really starting to see the additional revenue
synergies across the platform which we think will only ramp from here.
As Bryan said, we delivered GAAP EPS of $0.53 or $0.58 on an adjusted basis, reflecting the resiliency of our
balanced business model and exceptionally strong credit quality performance. Our results this quarter from a
revenue and expense perspective were in line with expectations. And as expected, net interest income headwinds
persist and we experienced continued strong fee income albeit lower than the outsized levels in the first quarter.
And we delivered continued improvement in expenses with an incremental $4 million of merger-related cost
saves.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2021
From a credit quality perspective, the combination of the improving macro environment and our own asset quality
including the benefit of upward grade migration in the loan portfolio exceeded expectations and drove a provision
credit of $115 million in the quarter with net recoveries, I repeat, net recoveries of $10 million. In fact, for the first
half of the year, we have an aggregate net recovery of $2 million on a $57 billion loan portfolio, outstanding
performance. We remain on track for our final systems conversion in the fall and continue to make progress
towards our $200 million net savings target with $92 million of those annualized savings in the quarter.
At the same time, we're making nice progress on those revenue synergies I talked about briefly via cross-sell and
leveraging our balance sheet to serve the broader customer base. We currently estimate that we're on track for
roughly $20 million of annualized revenue synergies across various commercial and consumer businesses with
more to come across all those platforms.
Turning to slide 7, I'll quickly review the notable and merger-related items in the quarter. As you can see, we had
$26 million after-tax or $0.05 a share of merger-related notable items. And as you know, in January, we raised our
expected net merger cost saves from $170 million to $200 million, consisting of gross cost saves of $250 million
and reinvestment of $50 million. We continue to be confident in achieving these savings.
In addition, we're now expecting our pre-tax merger costs to total about $500 million, and this increase is largely
driven by three components. First is tied to more recent developments related to product and capability
enhancements we've elected to make in connection with the integration. So, think of it as making the engine more
durable and powerful while the car is on the lift, so to speak, as we prepare for our systems conversion.
Secondly, we are seeing post-pandemic vendor and staffing constraints that have caused an increase in both the
level and the cost of estimated man hours required to complete our technology integration. And third, as we
finalized our decisions around accelerating our branch closures given the shift towards digital adoption, we still
have plans to close a total of 50 branches but now expect to see a higher level of impairment cost given the
ultimate mix of those branch closures that we've decided upon.
So, we believe spending an incremental 3 basis points of capital to position us far better for the future makes
good long-term business sense. And it's important to note that the payback period on the increased cost saves
and the addition of the revenue synergies we're already seeing is still well in line with our original estimate of
about two years.
Slide 8 provides an overview of our adjusted financials for the quarter. We generated PPNR of $321 million. As
expected, revenues decreased 3% from strong 1Q 2021 levels, given expected reductions, fixed income and
mortgage banking fees, along with continued NII pressure. Adjusted expense of $465 million remained relatively
stable in quarter, as the benefit of our incremental merger cost saves was muted by some higher long-term
incentive costs. And this quarter, the provision credit which we talked about at $115 million is compared to $45
million in the first. And as we sit here today, we see opportunity for more reserve releases in the future,
dependent of course upon several factors, including further macroeconomic improvement, low levels of net
charge-offs, and positive grade migration.
The pace of macroeconomic improvement is likely to be less pronounced that it was in Q2. But there's opportunity
for further positive grade migration as updated financial statements will be received from borrowers over the next
two quarters. Bottom line though, we expect the net impact of all those factors to be positive with further reserve
releases quite likely.

And as Bryan mentioned, we grew tangible book value per share by a strong 4% and generated an adjusted
ROTCE of 22% or 16% before the impact of that provision credit. Very, very strong performance.
Moving to slide 9, NII performed in line with expectations, declining $11 million linked-quarter on an FTE basis.
Both reported and core NIM were down 16 basis points linked-quarter, driven by about 12 basis points of impact
tied to higher excess cash. We ended the quarter with increasing levels of cash at about $12.7 billion, up from
$10.8 billion in the first quarter. We did also see pressure from lower loan balances; and given the competitive
landscape, experienced spread tightening on new originations compared to the runoff which collectively translated
to about 2 basis points on the NIM.
Given the change in rates and housing supply constraints, our mortgage warehouse outstandings decreased and
we saw increased pressure from premium amortization and lower LIBOR. In the face of these environmental
pressures, we are very, very focused on controlling what we can control and our continued deposit pricing
discipline is helping to mitigate the impact of those lower rates and overall muted loan demand. Interest-bearing
deposit costs of 20 basis points in the quarter remained stable and we're down 2 basis points excluding purchase
accounting.
And as we look forward, we continue to believe we're well positioned to benefit from an improving economy. At
quarter-end, our interest rate sensitivity or NII sensitivity to an up 100 shock was about 10% and about 6% on a
gradual basis.
Moving to slide 10, taking a look at fee income dynamics. Fixed income ADR came in at $1.4 million, compared to
the very strong first quarter of $1.9 million, reflecting continued favorable operating environment for the business
given high levels of cash in the banking system and immediate loan demand.
Mortgage banking and title fees came in at $38 million compared with higher first quarter levels. While fee income
was lower in our mortgage banking business, overall mortgage originations across our platform were very strong,
up 21% quarter-over-quarter with an intentional shift to on-balance sheet mortgages. The lower mortgage fee
income reflects the impacts of housing supply constraints, lower gain on sale spreads, and that intentional shift in
origination mix towards the portfolio. Our focus here is on customer-oriented relationships which we believe is a
better alternative for adding interest-earning assets as compared to securities purchases.
Importantly, given the overall economic momentum across our footprint, we saw a $4 million lift in card and digital
banking fees with a benefit of an increase in transaction volumes. And finally, I'd note that you'll see a $15 million
increase in other income which was driven by a nice $9 million securities gain largely related to a legacy
IBERIABANK equity investment.
Slide 11, taking a look at expenses, adjusted expense was $465 million and stable relative to the first quarter.
Personnel expense decreased $7 million linked-quarter, driven by a $6 million decline in incentives and
commissions, partially offset by increases in long-term revenue and performance-based incentives. In occupancy
and equipment, we saw a $3 million increase largely tied more to the equipment line which was related to some
strategic software investments. And finally, increased activity levels given the reopening of markets post
pandemic caused about a $2 million increase in our outside services line.
Slides 12 and 13, we take a look at our loan growth and our funding profile. You can see their average loan
balances were down about $1.4 billion in the quarter with commercial down about $800 million and consumer
down about $580 million. Commercial was impacted by about $1.1 billion decrease in our loans to mortgage
companies, partially offset by a $272 million increase in PPP balances.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2021
Last quarter, our mortgage warehouse volume was around 67% refi, and that's moderated in the second quarter
to 47%. And as we look forward, we do believe that some of our volume-related strategies in that business will
allow us to gain more share in mortgage warehouse lending with a net benefit to profitability. And outside of PPP
and mortgage warehouse, we did see a lift in overall commercial balances which we're hopeful will continue in the
second half of the year. As Bryan mentioned, we continue to be optimistic about the path of the economic
recovery and the increased activity levels as markets continue to reopen.
Quickly on the liability side, we saw a continued inflow of deposits driven by $2.1 billion average increase in non-
interest-bearing deposits with commercial balances including benefits from the second round of PPP. Total
deposit costs are at a very low 13 basis points with interest-bearing deposit costs at 20 bps.
On asset quality starting with slide 14, our overall credit quality continues to surprise to the upside. We had net
recoveries again of $10 million or 7 basis points, down 13 basis points from last quarter with non-performing loans
decreasing $50 million, 5-0.
Given the large provision credit, the allowance credit losses coverage ratio came in at 157 basis points compared
with 170 last quarter, driven by the continued improvement in the outlook, positive grade migration, those net
recoveries and lower loan balances. As you can see, our overall loss absorption capacity excluding mortgage
warehouse and PPP, as well as the unrecognized discount on our acquired loans, stands at a very healthy
2.23%.
Our credit quality is excellent. And while all peers are experiencing low levels of net charge-offs, our performance
is among the best-in-class, and we expect that to continue.
Turning to capital on slide 16, as Bryan mentioned, CET1 ratio is at a healthy 10.3%, up about 30 basis points or
so in the quarter, driven by growth in retained earnings and a reduction in risk-weighted assets. Increase was
partially offset by the capital return, Bryan talked about, through repurchases and dividends. We expect capital
levels to remain strong with flexibility to both deploy and optimize our capital structure.
Moving on to merger integration on slide 17. It's been a little more than a year since we closed our merger with
IBERIABANK, and we continue to make very good progress. We're focused on retaining and growing the client
base with our expanded products and services. As we talked about, we achieved $92 million in annualized run
rate savings. In early July, you see we successfully converted VirtualBank customers onto a new fully cloud-
based Finxact core. And in the coming months, as we prepare for our Fall 2021 core systems conversion, we plan
to complete our wealth, trust and credit card conversions as well, our first round of banking center consolidations,
and training for all associates on our new systems.
Turning to our outlook on slide 18. Our results this quarter were in line with the outlook we provided you in April
and we're providing an outlook for both the third quarter and the full year of 2021. You can see in the third quarter,
we do expect NII to decrease modestly given the outlook for lower PPP and the impacts of continued low rates
and reduced merger accretion. While we anticipate relatively resilient results in our fixed income business, we do
expect fee income to be down in the low-double digits to low-teens range due to lower mortgage banking fees.
We expect non-interest expense to decrease in the low single-digit range as our ongoing focus on efficiency and
merger costs saves comes through. We expect charge-offs to be in the range of 0 to 10 basis points, and it's
reasonable to see continued reserve outflows. We expect our CET1 to remain in the 10% to 10.5% range. We
now expect a mid-single-digit decrease in non-interest income with net charge-offs in the 0 to 10 basis-point

range and the CET1 10% and 10.5%. As Bryan mentioned, we feel good about the positioning and our ability to
perform well given the current economic environment.
Finally on slide 19, we are well positioned to capitalize on opportunities of our business model and franchise. Our
fee income businesses are performing just as we would have expected. We're controlling expenses. We're driving
down deposit costs. We're making good, prudent, long-term investments in talent and technology. We're seeing
good business activity as markets reopen. Credit quality is excellent. And we believe we'll continue to deliver
attractive returns near term and in the future.
Just a quick note, as many of you know, today is my 51st and final earnings call with First Horizon. In fact, it is
exactly 12.5 years since my first earnings call on January 16, 2009. That day, we reported a loss of $0.27,
whereas today we report a positive result of $0.58. It's been quite a ride and I started here at a time when the
company was arguably at its weakest, and I'm proud to say confidently I'm leaving here when it's at its strongest.
I've put my heart and soul into this place and it's returned to me so much more than I could have ever given it and
I'm forever grateful for that. I want to thank Bryan, the board, my executive team colleagues, my finance,
accounting, procurement, properties groups, and all my friends and colleagues at First Horizon that have been an
absolute pleasure to work with. And finally, thanks to the investor community for your support of our company. I've
enjoyed the performance, accountability, and intellectual challenge you provide to people fortunate enough to be
in my seat. I know I wasn't always right, but I always tried to do the right thing and I hope you experienced that.
So, with that, I'll turn it back over to Bryan.

D. Bryan Jordan
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Thank you, BJ. I'm exceptionally proud of the team's continued execution and the results we're delivering. We are
seeing activity levels pick up across our franchise and many of our specialty businesses. We're continuing to
execute well on our merger integration while making prudent investments to position us well for the future. Our
strong risk management posture is showcased by our asset quality metrics. I'm grateful to our associates for their
diligence around serving our customers and our communities. And I continue to be confident in our continued
progress towards becoming a top regional bank and our ability to drive long-term shareholder value.
And now, before I open it up for questions, I'll also make a couple of comments about BJ. As BJ just stated, he did
join us in 2009 in the midst of the financial crisis. Over the past 12, 12.5 years, he's been a key leader in helping
us reposition and position our business. He's been critical to developing our strategies, controlling our costs, and
many of the great accomplishments that we've had over the past 12 years. BJ is a trusted friend and a partner. I,
we will miss him. While I'm disappointed to see him leave, I fully support him in his new endeavors. You will be
missed.
So, with that, Betsy, we'll now take questions.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Maybe just starting on the expense side, with the additional $40 million investment, is there an opportunity to see
that $200 million ultimate cost save level increase from there or is that really more just the cost to get there has
gone up and that we should – that we'll probably see some additional negative operating leverage here in the next
few quarters as that gets rolled in?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Hey, Jared. It's BJ. I'll take that one. As you know, since you've known us for quite some time and followed us,
we're never done with cost saves and expense efficiencies. And so, we've started at $170 million, we're up to
$200 million. And in an environment like what we're operating in, I think we'll continue to look for additional
opportunities over time. Right now, we are all laser-focused on getting to our conversion in the fall, which is our
most important hurdle. The annualized $200 million is expected to be out of the run rate by the first half of 2022.
And between now and then, we'll continue building on additional expense opportunities beyond that to continue to
find more efficiencies in the expense line.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Hey, Jared. This is Bryan. I'll piggyback on BJ's comments. We feel very, very good about our ability to hit the
$200 million. And we think, if anything, there's very little of any downside to it. And we think there's a potential
upside as BJ said. We consistently look for opportunities to drive efficiency. And I think the nature of the business
is such that we've continually got to look for opportunities to reduce cost and changing our non-value-added areas
and put that into areas that require future investment in technology and infrastructure. So, we continue to use all
of our levers around expense control to make sure we position the business for the long term.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Great. Thanks. And then, as my – as a follow-up, maybe just on the mortgage side, what ultimately do you
think you could be retaining from that production as we go forward versus selling, and I guess the impact of that
on the gain on sale margin?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
So, I think what you'll see from us is a continued shift to on balance sheet portfolio originations. I do expect that
you'll see net increases in originations, maybe not as high as the 20% that we had seen. But the secondary
volume that we're seeing is still strong and we're capturing many opportunities. Our clients have seen more
opportunity in our portfolio originations, particularly around 7-year ARMs or a 15-year fixed, which we've seen
quite a bit of interest in. So, I think you'll see that continued shift with overall originations continuing to go up,
probably secondary continuing to moderate down and portfolio up. In terms of gain on sale, it is continuing to
moderate and we expect that to continue to come down over the next few quarters.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2021
Hi. Could you just talk about the revenue synergies you've seen today with IBERIA? And what's been kind of
better than expected and what's kind of lagged versus your expectations and where you see the biggest
opportunities in the next 12, 18 months or so?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Hey, Jennifer. This is Bryan. I'll start. We feel very, very good about the trend on revenue synergies. And I would
say, there are very few areas that we're concerned about lagging at this point. As you might expect, there's some
natural synergies that come from just being a larger organization, larger hold positions. But we're seeing very,
very good momentum across specialty lines of businesses where either organization may not have had an
opportunity in the past. Our equipment finance business, our asset-based lending business, our private client,
wealth management businesses, some of those take a little longer to build the infrastructure around it. But at the
end of the day, we feel very, very good about the progress that we're seeing. We're seeing opportunities continue
to multiply. And at this point, we feel very, very good that we're on track to exceed the $35 million that I've talked
about in the past. We think we're in that $20 million annualized area today in building momentum. Once we get
through this integration, we think it will pick up further momentum in the first and second quarters of next year.

Okay, great. And in terms of the loan loss reserve, you said more releases are likely assuming these credit trends

Hey, Jennifer. It's BJ. Likely not. I think day one CECL would have been around 110 basis points for us, I think, on
a combined basis. So, it's hard for me to think about it going much lower than that. It certainly could, but I don't
think that we would get there for a while. But with that said, if you exclude PPP and loans from mortgage
companies which carry very, very little, we've got 60 basis points or 70 basis points from where we're at today to
get down to those levels. So, again, we do believe that the macro environment will continue to improve. Credit
quality is excellent. The way we've managed both portfolios, both legacy portfolios, are really starting to shine
now. So, we do believe there's very healthy reserve releases to come over the next several quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Jennifer, I'll pick up on BJ's last comment, so Susan doesn't have to do it. A year ago, as we got into the
pandemic and not knowing how the economy was going to play out, there was a lot of concern industry-wide
about how credit would play out. And at that time, we said we felt that our portfolios would do as well or better
than most. And albeit admittedly the fiscal policy in the country reduced losses across the industry, we do believe
very strongly that our portfolios, both the legacy IBERIABANK portfolio and the First Horizon portfolio, and now
the combined portfolio, has performed in a very strong fashion. And we believe while it's top performance today,
we think that will continue given the way we approach credit and risk in the portfolio.
So, I'm very, very proud of the result. I can't say that I'm a big fan of CECL and the reserve methodologies and –
but I do believe that we will migrate back down towards as day one levels as quickly as anybody. And I think that
we will continue to deliver that very strong and consistent credit performance as a result of our efforts to manage
risk in appropriate way.

Wanted just to talk about the liquidity on the balance sheet. And if you think about the cash balances, they're now
16% of average earning assets and with the guidance for that – for the cash to continue to build. Obviously, not a
great environment for reinvesting cash and securities, but just how do you intend, if anything, to maybe manage
some of the liquidities, you might do some securities purchases from here and just thinking about trying to
manage – obviously, manage NII more than the margin, but just thinking about the margin and possible ways to
kind of offset the margin pressure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah, it's BJ. So, yeah, we're actively thinking about that and we are seeing accelerated levels of cash that we're
reinvesting in the securities portfolio. In aggregate, we have not materially increased it at this point. We're buying
mostly agencies, CMO, MBS with a little bit of high-quality municipal in it. And we can modestly look at something
there over time as well. But we're more focused on trying to create interest-earning assets on the portfolio that
have a customer relationship to it. And going back to our earlier comments on mortgage originations and finding
ways to give clients more opportunities from a portfolio usage perspective, it's likely where we're going to go.

We've also been a bit more active in owner-occupied commercial real estate on the commercial side and offering
some attractive opportunities across our footprint there. So, a little bit more fixed rate type lending opportunities
that we're looking to try to build upon. So, I think we're a little bit more focused there. So, I think – fortunately or
unfortunately, I think it's a high-class problem to have. But I think we'll have these deposit excess cash balances
for a while. But to your point, we're much more focused on NII and I think we're hopeful that the core NII is really
bottoming out at this level and we see going forward opportunity for growth in the core NII. So, that's what we're
planning on and executing upon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. I appreciate the color, BJ, on that. And then, I guess the other thing I wanted to address was just the
guidance around the 3Q non-interest income, low-double digit to low-teens decrease. Can you talk maybe about
the components of that, what percentage of that might be fixed income versus other segments that aren't fee
income?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Hey, Brett. It's BJ again. I think it's going to be mostly on the mortgage side. And again, it's related to some
comments I made earlier around the secondary originations probably continuing to trend lower plus continued
moderation in gain on sale. Fixed income, we still expect to be relatively strong around the levels that we're at,
maybe $100,000, $200,000, plus or minus where we're at. But it's mostly on the mortgage side.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I guess first just around loan growth, Bryan, some of the comments you made around the headwinds, be it
inventory – lack of inventory, labor shortage, et cetera, how should we think about – any chances of loan growth
picking up meaningfully this year for the bank? Like do you see this being a third quarter event, fourth quarter or
most likely a first half 2022 event that you actually see net loan growth coming in in a meaningful way?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. So, you use the term meaningful a couple of times. Some – that's a term of art. Some of – we try to avoid
defining meaningful. But we're pretty optimistic about the back half of the year in terms of our loan pipelines. As I
mentioned and BJ mentioned in his comments, we saw loan pipelines building in May and June when we look
across where we see those pipelines building, it's very broad-based. It's in our really high-growth markets that are
sort of a combination of IBERIA and First Horizon markets like Texas. We see strength in Louisiana, the
Carolinas, it's very broad-based there. And we also see very strong pipelines in in our specialty businesses,
particularly those specialty businesses like asset base lending, franchise finance, equipment finance, which in
many ways sort of lead our early signs of a strengthening economy. So, we're encouraged by that.
The other specialty businesses are mortgage warehouse lending business. Our balances came down a bit this
quarter. We expect that that will strengthen in the third and in the fourth quarter given that the pipelines that we
see there. So, we do see the signs of strengthening pipelines and loan growth.
On the converse side of that, we believe, based on what we know, that there's still going to be a relatively high
level of payoffs, paydown in certain sectors particularly real estate-oriented sectors, for example, where refinance
activity, taking stuff into the capital markets, or using significant liquidity is reducing the outstanding. But on the
whole, we feel good about we're positioned with broad markets. We feel well positioned with the pipelines that we
see, the specialty businesses that we have. And to the extent that there is growth in the overall economy that's
driving loan growth, we think we're going to get our fair share and maybe more.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
One thing I would add to that is, as you know, we were a big participant in the PPP program at both legacy banks.
And while that obviously the PPP is contributing to runoff, we've got really good feedback across our markets in
some of our specialty areas about the ability and we're working on all these to pick up additional business where
we were able to service both clients and prospects and help them with PPP when their – potentially their existing
bank could not. And what we're seeing is that could really be an additional benefit for us later this year and into
2022 as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q

Got it. And just as a follow-up, you talked about revenue synergies. In particular, Bryan, if you could address,
when we think about the mortgage business and the capital markets business, where do you see the greatest

synergies now that you had one year since the deal closed from the merger? And how quickly do you think you
can start monetizing on those opportunities in terms of its impact on revenue growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. So, if you take the mortgage business as an example, our team, [indiscernible] (42:31) and his team have
done a really good job of taking the mortgage products. We've integrated our systems. We're rolling out the
expanded capability across the First Horizon footprint. And I would say that over 12 years, if we developed a bad
habit, that bad habit would be we didn't really [indiscernible] (42:55) First Horizon legacy footprint view the
mortgage as a critical part of the consumer banking relationship simply because we were outsourced on the
delivery of that product.
Now, that we've got it in-source, we're seeing tremendous momentum pick up as people are leveraging that
muscle again to really ask for the mortgage and build out that capability. And as BJ alluded to in his comments a
few minutes ago, we're seeing our bankers originate more mortgages for customers and a lot of that is going on to
the balance sheet.
So, I'm optimistic that our FHN business will continue to see opportunities to grow. We've added debt capital
markets capabilities in our fixed income business which we're seeing significant momentum building over the last
two or three quarters. So, I'm optimistic that on the revenue synergy side that the goals we set which I think based
on Capital Bank integration were relatively modest and will lead to significant revenue growth down the road.

Yeah. From the systems perspective, you'll see that principally next year. We're implementing the incentive
system, for example, which is a complete rollout across the entire organization IBERIABANK used that we're
putting in a new installation, that momentum and the technology drivers of speed will really start to show up in the
fourth quarter and in the first and second quarters of next year.

Got it. And then, as you think about the continual buildout of the digital bank and what you talked about with
Finxact, will you do kind of more sort of public announcements on that and – or even have more visible examples
of sort of additional cost saves kind of beyond what you've already pledged on the $200 million? I'm just sort of
curious if we'll see some signs of that as you continue to go forward.

Sure, Bryan. So, Chris, what I'll tell you is certainly we are a big believer in technology being able to drive overall
efficiency for the corporation as we move forward. So, I think the simple answer to your question is our
expectation would be as we continue to invest in technology and then you overlay kind of the – I'll call it, the
shifting preference of our customer base, we should be able to drive more efficiency and leverage the technology
moving forward. So, I think you'll see that kind of bleed in continuously as we kind of cross the conversion period
into next year and then hopefully continue thereafter.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
On the margin, just wanted to see if you can give us your thoughts on the outlook for the margin from here. I know
you saw the impact of the liquidity drive a portion of the 16-basis-point compression this quarter. So, wanted to
see how you think about the NIM progression. And then, also I know you mentioned competition a couple times
and pressure on loan spreads, can you give us a little bit of color there, like, for example, where some of your new
money loan yields are coming in at this point? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Sure. It's a slippery slope trying to forecast the margin at this point, right? We've just seen continued buildup of
excess cash here and across the industry. And with $3.5 trillion infrastructure program and more child tax credit
payments come in, I mean, I think that buildup is going to continue. So, that's why we – we're more focused
obviously on NII and we do think that the core NII for us is bottoming out for a couple of different reasons. One is
we still think that there's opportunity to move deposit costs down modestly. We've got some exception price
deposits that are still at higher levels than we would want. And we'll continue to move those down. We do expect
that we're going to start to see a pickup in loan demand as markets reopen, so that's going to add to our NII. So,
we are optimistic that we're going to see some there.
In terms of what kind of loan yields we're seeing right now, from a commercial perspective, we're seeing new loan
yields in the regional bank just over 3% with average durations in the five-year range. Our specialty businesses
are probably a little bit lower than that, maybe 2.75% with slightly lower durations. So, those yields are probably
40 to 50 basis points lower than our portfolio yields across those portfolios right now. So, there is yield
compression and margin compression out there across the industry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Yeah. And then, secondly on the capital front. Just want to get updated thoughts on your CET1 target. I know
your internal target is about 9.5% to 10%. And I know you mentioned some [audio gap] (49:40) optimize your
capital structure. Any consideration around the potential reduction [audio gap] (49:45)?

D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. John, for some reason you were breaking up a bit. But I think you were asking about CET1 target and that
we're a little bit above where we've said, 9.5% to 10%. We are – we're not uncomfortable seeing it move up or
down a little bit around those areas as we pointed out a couple of different ways. We have been using capital to
repatriate shareholders through our stock repurchase program. We have plenty of capacity available in that and
we will continue to be opportunistic. And we think that today's valuations are very attractive vis-à-vis a long-term
value.
We are – as you know, and one of the great legacies that BJ will leave is the bonefish and our drive towards
capital efficiency. And we focus very much on excess capital in the organization and don't believe letting it build
up and being deployed for bad uses is a good thing. And that we'll use excess capital to repatriate to our
shareholders. So, at the end of the day, we still believe in that 9.5% to 10%. We think given some of the signs of
opportunistic growth, we will absorb it between growth, organic growth, and our share repurchase programs.

Hey, Ken.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Actually, I just want to go back to the net – into the net interest income guidance just a little bit. If I take your third
quarter guidance and sort of put it in with – kind of with the actual numbers in the first half, it still feels – actually,
numerically it looks like your net interest income has to decline in 3Q, and then it also has to decline even further
in 4Q to get to your full-year guidance, so sort of that mid-single-digit decline. I'm using 5% as sort of that
midpoint. But it just feels like that's a bit contradictory to your more optimistic outlook around, I think BJ just
mentioned, your core NII is stable because you expect to pick up in loan demand, presumably, you mean in the
second half, but – it's just unclear. And I was hoping you can clarify all that. Thank you.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2021
Hey, Ken. Thanks. Yeah, it's BJ. So, we've still had a healthy amount of PPP accretion. We've still had a very
healthy amount of loan accretion from the marks on the IBERIA loans. And if you look at kind of the walk forward
that we have for you on the NII page, you can kind of see that the moderation in our total NII is coming down. So,
while we do expect that core NII will continue to strengthen and increase, it's likely to be more than offset by lower
loan accretion and less PPP benefits than we have had in the first half of the year. So, that's really the dynamic
that is going on there. On our outlook slide, we gave you total NII outlook, but that's the underlying dynamics as to
why it looks the way it does.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. No, that is helpful. And just to go back to a prior question on loan growth in the back half of the year.
I think, Bryan, when you mentioned – when you were answering the question, it feels like you spoke a lot about
pipelines. And because I just want to make sure that you said you're optimistic about pipelines improving but as
we all know, pipeline and balances are sort of two different things. Are you also – and just to be clear on this, but
are you also optimistic that loan balances actually improve in the back half of the year or is it just pipelines?
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah, Ken. Again, I spoke about pipelines, but I also spoke about the outlook for payoffs and there's a significant
liquidity. And the short answer is we're optimistic about loan growth. I think in our mortgage warehouse business
and others, we should see some growth. But it's – in this part of the cycle with a significant amount of liquidity in
the markets, it's hard to know what payoffs might be. And so, that is the sort of the toggle factor that we just don't
know. So, our outlook is optimistic but we don't control what we don't control which is payoffs. The PPP balances
are clearly going to come down with forgiveness, et cetera. So, depending on what part is a little bit like the net
interest margin question that you asked BJ, it really depends on what line or what sector of the line item you're
looking at. But I think on the core business, we're reasonably optimistic about our ability to grow if we can retain
the balances that's set out every day.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
And Ken, we did – if you – looking at May and June in terms of new commitment production, now granted to your
point it doesn't necessarily translate into the balances yet, but very strong new commitment production in both
May and June, and really across the – many of the areas that Bryan mentioned in the earlier question, it was the
number of our specialty areas, ABL, equipment finance, franchise finance, health care. And then, the regional
banks Alabama, Texas, Louisiana, East Tennessee, North Carolinas, et cetera. So, I know the credit teams are
busy working with the line on looking at these opportunities to increase both for existing clients but also
opportunities that we have with prospects. So, the activity level has definitely picked up.

think we see in our business coming out of this integration. So, yeah, sure, we'll pick our spots, but we'll be
opportunistic and use the authorization to repurchase shares to manage our capital levels particularly our excess

another decent stepdown in fourth quarter. And I guess my question is you said earlier that a lot of that has to do
with mortgage, but obviously has probably to do with some fixed income headwinds to just of really high levels.
But that said, I mean do you think fourth quarter will be the trough? And do you think you can actually grow fee
income as you move into next year? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Hey, it's BJ, Michael. And, yeah, I actually am happy you brought that up because one thing I forgot to
mention when I was talking about that stepdown was don't forget that we had about $11 million or so of securities
gains in this quarter, which is kind of a part of the adjusted baseline, if you will. So, obviously, those security gains
on the legacy IBERIA investment and another smaller one aren't going to reoccur. So, that's part of the stepdown.
Then, the majority of the rest of it is related to mortgage.
And like I said, fixed income continues to remain strong with all the excess cash in the system. And what I said
earlier was we're at $1,450 million, I think, to put a fine point on it. And so, being somewhere around that range,
plus or minus, is likely where it will be, at least over the next quarter, if not through the rest of the year.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, everybody.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Hey, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Good morning, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Hi, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
So, I know that overall deposit levels continue to rise for the industry, right, just given stimulus and other factors.
But I'm curious, when you guys look at your typical bid market customer and your markets, are they starting to
draw down deposits to fund investments or are their deposit balances still also rising?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Like any generalization, it'll be wrong. But for the most part, their balances are still rising. There's still a fair
amount of cautiousness around new investments. And to pick an example, fiscal policy, and what a capital gains
rates look like, what the tax rate – corporate tax rates look like, what does a return on investment, all of those
things are still affecting people's psychology about making investments. This isn't an anecdote, but we had an
equipment lease that was actually repaid with cash in spite of prepaid penalties, et cetera.
So, people are taking cash and they're being fairly cautious with it, and reducing debt. And putting it on the
sidelines until they get a little bit more clarity about where the economy and the pandemic are headed, and things
like bluntly where we end up from a monetary, and more importantly, maybe a fiscal policy as we work through
this period of uncertainty around corporate tax rates, et cetera.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. But Bryan, regarding the optimism around loan growth resuming in the second half, all right, are the – your
customers signaling they plan to draw on credit lines despite that they're still sitting on excess liquidity
themselves?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. The credit line utilization hasn't changed. It might just sort of hang in there at that 45% area. And we see
customers – it's a mixed bag. We see some customers that are looking at things or they're booking new
commitments, and they're indicating that they're going to draw on these commitments and others that are being

more cautious about it. So, it is one of the things where I guess everybody, us included, has a little bit fuzzy
crystal ball about how things are going to play out. If you spun back 18 months ago or 15 months ago or even 6
months ago, we wouldn't have been able to predict how things have played out with a whole lot of certainty. And I
think we look at the next six months and say that there are a lot of things in motion. And on the whole, what we
see in terms of building pipelines, what we see in terms of customer acquisition and call-in efforts, we're more
optimistic than not. But there is still a certain amount of uncertainty – there is a fair amount of uncertainty.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks for that. And then, for my follow-up question, with the 10-year trending lower despite the firming
inflation data, the million-dollar question everybody has is outside of central banks, who is exactly purchasing
treasuries here? And you guys have a very unique vantage point into this, right? ADR is very strong again in the
quarter. So, maybe could you give us some color on what types of investors you guys see in your fixed income
business actively buying treasuries here and is it banks? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Hey, Steve. It's BJ. Yeah, it's interesting. What I think our fixed income people would tell us is that it's actually
predominantly the largest US banks. So, we haven't really seen any material change in how they're holding
liquidity. So, they are the ones that are buying up a lot of the treasuries. We're seeing a little bit of purchasing
from Japan and Europe, but predominantly it's being driven by the largest US banks which is interesting dynamic.

Steven Alexopoulos Q

Okay. That's great color. And congratulations, BJ. We'll talk to you soon. Thanks.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2021
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So, the mortgage warehouse was down, I think, a little more than people had expected. Linked-quarter was down
about 20%, which is kind of a big move. I know that has been very robust over the last year or so with COVID and
everything. But maybe just talk about the warehouse from here, do you expect it to recover at all? Is this – or is
this a good level or could we see maybe some additional weakness as mortgage continues to cool down?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. Brady, this is Bryan. As we sit here today, we're optimistic we'll see some recovery in those balances over
the next couple of quarters. There are a lot of things going on in the mortgage space right now. Some of it is just a
constraint around housing supply and the inability for new purchase money transactions to actually occur.
Refinance activity has leveled off. It's going to ebb and flow given the 10 years that Steve just pointed out. But
given some tweaks that we've been making which we think will allow us to pick up additional market share of our
existing customer base or warehouse share of our existing customer base, we're expecting that balances will
probably drift up over the next couple of quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. That's good to hear. And then, my second question is just on PPP fees. I think you guys had about $35
million of them this quarter which is a high watermark, so far. Just remind us what's the level of PPP fees that are
left and any thoughts on the timing of that realization.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Hey, Brady. It's BJ. At the end of the second quarter, we have about $27 million left, and we think that that will
continue to come down probably over the next 15 months or so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. Well, BJ, great working with you and good luck at Live Oak.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. If we could just go back to mortgage business in terms of the gain on sale and
the gain on sale trajectory, how should we think about that? I hear you, it's lower. But should we look at that as
lower for the duration that overall mortgage volume may be falling or is this – do you see this as more of a
shorter-term adjustment, deep driven by competition in the market?

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2021
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Hey, Brock. This is Bryan. I'll start. I tend to think that the gain on sale spreads are probably not going to expand
as much. Pricing was the leverage to slow down volumes and periods of peak volume where everybody was
having trouble meeting demand. And at that volume, particularly refinanced activities [ph] subsided (01:06:55). I'd
be surprised if gain on sale mortgage has expanded back out.
As – in our income statement, particularly in the fee income line, it's really a function of two things, the level of
secondary sales; and two, the gain on sale percentages. [indiscernible] (01:07:15) you made some real
simplifying assumptions and said, okay, we booked probably $350 million or so into our portfolio that might
otherwise have been sold in the secondary markets and assume that they were sold at the same gain on sale
spread which I know we're overly simplifying. And that's probably $12 million of pre-tax earnings that comes back
to us through enhanced yield over time.
So, we're looking at volumes and spreads and thinking about how it was the right mix of balance sheet, known
balance sheet. And we asked and answered earlier in the call about duration and expanding the size of our
securities and using excess cash. We clearly want to use our balance sheet to support customer activity. And
where that is is driven through duration and mortgage product, we'll look at it. But on the whole, we think as you
summarized earlier, you have the – directionally, mortgage gains will likely be down and that spreads in our view
are not going to expand out significantly from here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks for that. And just going back to your earlier comment on mortgage. My understanding was that that
is still primarily that the IBERIA part of the franchise and that once you knit together the systems, then you can
introduce it on legacy FHN side. Is that accurate or has that already happened?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
It's – and I would say that it's inaccurate in the sense that we have that product available across the broader
franchise. It is accurate in the sense that we are not practiced at originating the kinds of volumes we think we can
originate out of the First Horizon franchise. So, we believe that we have much more capacity in the legacy First
Horizon franchise because we have trained ourselves to not be in that business and have sort of indirect
fulfillment model. Given the direct fulfillment model and the success we're seeing with that, we think that we will
see much greater mortgage volume out of the legacy First Horizon franchise over time.

Good morning, Casey.

Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
I wanted to circle back on capital. So, the CET1 ratio, you're taking that up about 50 bps. I'm just curious why. I
mean, you sound like you're going to be pretty opportunistic on the buyback, just curious why you're taking up the
capital floor, when you feel good about credit and just some color there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William C. Losch III A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah, Casey. I wouldn't necessarily say we're taking up the capital for it, we're just giving you kind of our view of
where capital is likely to be. You know, as Bryan alluded to, we'll be opportunistic on share repurchases, and that
we'll use some capital wisely. RWA growth is going to continue to be muted. And so, the combination of those two
will – for a 10.3% today, we're giving you a range of 10% to 10.5%, if we start to see some RWA and loan growth
coupled with some share repurchases, it floats to the lower end. And conversely, if we don't, it goes towards to
the higher end. But I think Bryan's point earlier was ultimately, we're more comfortable from a balance sheet
perspective and a capital optimization perspective more in the 9.5% range. But just given kind of the dynamics of
the environment today, we'll likely be more in the 10% to 10.5%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Okay, got it. And then, on the M&A front, obviously, a pretty active environment still. Could you just give us
some updated thoughts on First Horizon's appetite today?

Yeah. I don't think very much has changed from our perspective. We're still very, very focused on getting our
integration completed and then really following that, delivering on what we think are the huge opportunities that
exist in our existing franchise with the significant growth markets that we have the opportunity to serve at our 12th
state footprint, our combined banking footprint, and what we think are the opportunities to just grow organically.
So, we don't – we're not thinking that M&A is critical to our strategy. It's not built into our strategy. Our strategy is
designed around let's execute in a very seamless and thoughtful way for our customers, delivering the breadth of
best products and technology to capitalize on the huge growth opportunities that we have in our footprint and
invest organically. And then, if something comes up along the way, we will certainly consider it. But at the end of
the day, it's not something that we're taking our eye off the ball in terms of execution. Today, we're really focused
on delivering the promise of the IBERIABANK-First Horizon merger of equals.
