Thomas Robert Cangemi
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Sal. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we go into the details of this
year's results, I would like to provide some commentary to put the past year into perspective. When I was
appointed President and CEO three years ago, we embarked upon transforming the legacy New York Community
Bank business model from a monoline thrift to a dynamic, diversified, full service commercial bank.
2023 was an important inflection point. We built on the momentum created by the Flagstar acquisition that closed
in December of 2022 and continue to successfully execute our transformation strategy while establishing a clear
path for future growth. We reported $2.3 billion of net income available to common stockholders, up from $617
million in 2022. We significantly diversified our balance sheet with commercial loans representing an increasingly
greater percentage of total loans. Similarly, the percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits to total deposits have
nearly quadrupled since just before we closed the Flagstar acquisition. We began the Flagstar integration
successfully meeting every milestone throughout the year, with the systems conversion set for mid-February. We
also unveiled a rebranding campaign that we'll launch shortly after the systems conversion is completed, which
has been well-received both internally and externally.
And we acquired select financially and strategically complementary assets and liabilities from Signature Bank,
which strengthened our balance sheet by adding a significant amount of low cost deposits and added a middle
market business supported by over 130 private banking teams. Importantly, the addition of Signature Bank

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 31-Jan-2024
catapulted us to over $100 billion in total assets, placing us firmly in the Category IV large bank class of banking
institutions in $100 billion and $250 billion in total assets. The last three years were all a build up at this moment.
And since the closing of the Flagstar acquisition in particular, we have been preparing to cross this important
threshold. When the opportunity to acquire Signature presented itself, and we were honored to be selected as the
winning bidder by the FDIC, the benefits were clear. This acquisition allowed us to advance our strategy while
strengthening and diversifying our balance sheet. However, this acquisition also meant we will become a $100
billion-plus bank sooner than we had anticipated, subjecting us to enhanced prudential standards, including risk-
based and leverage capital requirements, liquidity standards, and requirements for overall risk management and
stress testing.
Alongside the integration of three banks, NYCB, Signature, and Flagstar, and as we prepare for our first capital
plan submission in April of this year, we have pivoted quickly and accelerated some enhancements that come
with being a Category IV bank. Specifically, we are taking decisive actions to build capital, strengthen our balance
sheet and risk management processes, which better aligns us with the relevant peers for bank of our larger size
and complexity. These actions include investing to strengthen our risk management capabilities to align with the
enhanced prudential standards applicable to Cat IV banks as set forth on the Reg YY, building our reserve levels,
which brings our ACL coverage more in line with peer banks, including Category IV banks, and adding on balance
sheet liquidity as we prep for Regulation YY compliance. We believe these actions are another prudent step
enhancing our risk management infrastructure. I will go on to more details in a moment on how these actions
impacted our results in the fourth quarter.
We are also accelerating our capital build by reducing our common stock dividend to $0.05 per share. We
understand the importance and the impact of this decision to our stockholders. This was not made lightly. While
NCYB remains well-capitalized under all applicable regulatory requirements, resetting our capital allocation
priorities was a necessary step to accelerate the building of our capital. We are confident that these actions we
took in the fourth quarter and the continued execution of our strategy will position the company to deliver
enhanced value over the long term. We successfully grew into a $50 billion-plus bank in 2018, and we believe the
actions we are taking now are building the foundation to make our transition to a $100 billion-plus bank even more
successful.
Moving now to the results. The company reported $2.3 billion in net income available to common stockholders in
2023 or $3.24 per diluted share. On an operating basis which excludes merger related charges, a $2.2 billion
bargain purchase gain related to Signature transaction and a onetime special FDIC assessment of $39 million,
reported net income available to common stockholders was $609 million or $0.80 per diluted share. As I said
earlier, the actions we undertook impacted several items during the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2023,
we reported a net loss of $252 million or $0.36 per share. On an operating basis, the company reported a net loss
of $193 million or $0.27 per share. Our fourth quarter results were impacted by the actions we undertook including
a $552 million provision for credit losses.
Let's begin with asset quality. Non-performing loans were stable in the fourth quarter as compared to the third
quarter of the year, despite some continued weakness in the commercial real estate sector. At December 31,
2023, non-performing loans totaled $428 million and represented 37 basis points of total loans compared to $435
million or 40 basis points in the previous quarter. During the fourth quarter, we significantly built our reserves to
address office sector weakness and an expected increase in criticized loans due to repricing risk in the multifamily
portfolio, which better aligns NYCB with our relevant peer bank, including Category IV banks. At December 31,
2023, the allowance for credit losses was $992 million, up $373 million compared to the previous quarter and
represented 1.17% of total loans, up from 74 basis points compared to the previous quarter. Excluding loans with

government guarantees and lower risk mortgage warehouse loans, the ACL coverage was 1.26% in the fourth
quarter compared to 80 basis points in the previous quarter.
Since the third quarter of 2022, we have built our reserves by $774 million. Net charge-offs for the quarter were
$185 million or 22 basis points of average loans, driven by two loans. First, we had one co-op loan with a unique
feature that pre-funded capital expenditures. Although the borrower is not in default, we transferred the loan to
held for sale in the fourth quarter and expect it to be sold during the first quarter. Importantly, this loan is a one-off
and our review did not uncover any other co-op loans similar to this one. Second, we had an additional charge-off
of an office loan that became non-accrual in the third quarter, based on an updated valuation. This loan was more
than we originally expected. And we responded by recalibrating our qualitative factors in the office portfolio to
address the issue and increase the ACL coverage on the office portfolio. Collectively, these two loans accounted
for the bulk of the charges we took during the fourth quarter.
The other major action we took was regarding our on balance sheet liquidity. During the fourth quarter, we began
preparing to be Regulation YY compliant. Though this was earlier than we originally anticipated, we thought it
prudent to be ready to meet the enhanced liquidity requirements that apply to Category IV banks. Therefore, we
had monetized some of our contingent liquidity sources and started to build our on balance sheet liquidity during
the fourth quarter, which has continued into Q1. We realize that this will negatively impact our net interest margin
in the short term, but is essential that we, as a newly minted $100 billion bank, prudently manage our liquidity.
Moving next to net interest margin. The fourth quarter net interest margin came in at 2.82%, down 45 basis points
compared to the third quarter. This was 18 basis points lower than our guide of down 27 basis points. The 18
basis points variance to the guidance was largely due to actions related to increase our on balance sheet liquidity
and higher deposit costs. On the lending front, total loans held for investment were up $624 million or 3%
annualized compared to the third quarter of 2023 to $84.6 billion. Most of the growth occurred in the C&I portfolio,
partially offset by a decline in multifamily while the rest of the CRE portfolio remained unchanged. At December
31, 2023, total commercial loans represented 46% of total loans, while multifamily loans represented 44% of total
loans, representing significant diversification from a year ago.
Turning now to deposits. Total deposits at year end were $81.4 billion compared to $82.7 billion at the end of the
third quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by an expected $1.8 billion decrease in custodial deposits related
to the Signature transaction. Excluding these deposits, the total deposits increased $457 million or 2% annualized
compared to the third quarter, primarily driven by growth in CDs, partially offset by lower noninterest-bearing
deposits. The shift to higher cost CDs was due to increased competition and customer behavior. Deposits from
legacy Signature teams, excluding deposits to the loan portfolio we did not retain, increased $1.5 billion at the end
of March.
Moving now to expenses. The full year non-interest expense we – non-core expenses, which this quarter included
the FDIC special assessment of $39 million, total OpEx for the three months ended December 31, 2023 were
$557 million, down $28 million compared to $585 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The
decrease was primarily driven by compensation and benefits expense due to lower incentive compensation
expense, partially offset by higher professional fees.
Turning now to our full year 2024 guidance. In the past, we have typically provided just quarterly guidance.
However, in order to provide more transparency and to be more in line with industry peer practices, we are
providing standard full year guidance in which we had summarized in our investor presentation slides 36 and 37.
In 2024, we expect period ending total loans to decline 3% to 5% compared to December 31, 2023, period ending
total deposit to increase between 3% to 5%, cash and securities balances to increase $7.5 billion on a combined

basis, the net interest margin, 2.4% to 2.5% for the full year exclusive of – inclusive of actions to increase on
balance sheet liquidity for Regulation YY compliance, noninterest income in the range of $570 million to $620
million, which includes mortgage-related income of $220 million to $260 million, operating expenses in the range
of $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion due to a full year impact from Signature Bank, the full year impact of 13 private
banking teams from the former First Republic Bank, Signature Bank integration deferral to 2025 in order to
minimize customer impact and additional cost related to becoming a Category IV bank, normal compensation and
benefits expense increases and approximately $60 million of conversion related savings from Flagstar. We expect
our CET1 regulatory capital ratio for the holding company to be at 10% by year end 2024 and its 20 – and a 23%
full year tax rate.
We entered 2024 having taken prudent balance sheet actions as we become a Category IV bank. Importantly, the
bank has a solid foundation in place and a proven track record across business cycles. We believe we are
positioned well to navigate our growth and development as an organization and deliver for customers. And we are
confident that it will enable us to deliver long-term value for stockholders. Finally, I would like to say a special
thank you for all of our teammates. We have a fantastic team. And as always, we deeply appreciate the
dedication and commitment to our clients, customers, and communities.
With that, we'll be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, please open up the line for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of
America. Please go ahead.

Ebrahim Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities-Merrill Lynch
Hi. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Ebrahim.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities-Merrill Lynch
Good morning. I guess maybe if we can start on credit. So obviously, it took a huge reserve build this quarter.
Just talk to us in terms of your expectations around losses going forward. So one, what's the reserve build at the
end of the fourth quarter cover and what that imply for future reserve build through the course of 2024? And then
give us a sense relative to the charge-off you took in the fourth quarter, 22 basis points. Where do you see credit
losses migrating next year, and if you expect any losses to come from the multifamily book? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Hey there. Appreciate the question, Ebrahim. Let me just give you a general view of the fourth quarter and the
process on where we came in at. Obviously, we looked at the marketplace, looked at the office perspective and
the general office weaknesses throughout the country, and we really did a deep dive in the office portfolio as well

as thinking through payment shock and interest rate shock given the rise of interest rates that we've experienced
over the past few quarters, in particular the impact to our customers in respect to repricing. We took into account
that perspective and clearly had significant additions to our reserve build, where a lot of that reserve build went
into the office in particular. I believe the number went from 200 basis points reserve from Q3 to 800 basis points
reserve in particular for office. So given that we gave out the statistics on the actual performance of the portfolio,
there hasn't been a whole lot of change in respect to the NPAs and delinquencies. However, we had moved some
of these loans into a status of criticized position because of the nature of looking and thinking about the office
sector and the reserve build out with the anticipation of office still having difficulties within the marketplace.
That being said, 800 basis points, I believe, gets us very close to – in line with our current peer group, which is a
new peer group, Category IV banks, as I indicated in my previous remarks. And we're confident that we continue
to look at the portfolio at -in significant detail as we are now benchmarking ourselves into a marketplace that has
changed – no question has changed, and we've focused in on payment shock, interest rate shock, and the
development in the commercial space.
If you want – John, if you want to add some more comments back to the ACL and then the calculation there as
well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Sure, Tom. And besides the office portion of the ACL though, the other item that Tom mentioned earlier is around
the multifamily loan portfolio and the repricing risk in that portfolio. As we see our loans continue to hit their option
date and reprice higher, we want to make sure that that risk is captured in the qualitative factors as well this
quarter. So we were able to do that and increase the reserve on multi as well. So we saw increases specifically in
office and CRE and multi when you look at a coverage ratio from an ACL perspective.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities-Merrill Lynch
Right. But do you expect that – the coverage and the pressure on multi translating into losses on that portfolio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
On the multifamily portfolio, we have not seen significant losses in multifamily, with the exception, of course, of
the one loan that Tom mentioned, the multifamily co-op loan, which rolls up to the multifamily category. And
historically, if you look back at what we've had higher levels of substandard throughout the financial crisis,
throughout the pandemic, those that – just the rise in substandard loans does not lead directly to specific losses.
So we're still very comfortable in the quality of the multifamily portfolio. We're not seeing anything on the early
stage delinquency side yet either. We did see a little pop in 30 to 89 days, but a lot of those loans, we had about
$60 million that cleared right after 12/31 and the first couple of weeks of January. So we're not seeing any
significant trends in the multifamily portfolio besides the repricing risk that we spoke about.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, Ebrahim, [ph] in respect of that (00:18:15) comment, I would add that when you think about how we looked at
the forward curve, when we looked at the interest rate environment as of the fourth quarter, we did not take into
account changes in future interest rates when we shock the cash flow, both the payment shock and interest rate
shock. So we believe that's pretty punitive in the event of a potential side pivot, but we're assuming that rates stay

where they are and roll that out for a year. And what is the impact on future [ph] bars (00:18:38) that have to go
into [ph] year six (00:18:38) and it will go [ph] on a higher structure and (00:18:41) amortizing structure and we
shocked them. That put a lot of those loans closer to a 1:1 debt service coverage ratio, in some cases slightly
below on a pro forma basis. And that will be a substandard view of the asset, although they are in performance
status. And as you all know, last year, we had an abundance of customers take the SOFR option when SOFR
was much lower and obviously they ran through that. They're waiting on the sidelines. They feel very strongly that
they're going to exercise their ability to lock in longer-term financing when rates move the other way. So they are
sitting on the sidelines, paying the bank, go for closer spread, and they'll make the decisions when there's a
possibility of a rate change. That's what we're hearing from our customer base.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities-Merrill Lynch
Got it. And maybe, John, just on the net interest margin. So, fourth quarter is that 2.82%, just given the trajectory
of the 2.40% to 2.50%, like what do you expect the NIM to reset in the first quarter? And then what have – is that
guidance still hold if we get three or four rate cuts during the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. Yeah. On your second question, yes, the guidance would still hold with three rate cuts throughout the year.
And if you look at the full year, 2.40% to 2.50% margin, we're comfortable with that for the first quarter as well,
probably a little closer in the first quarter to the lower end of that spectrum. But we're comfortable with the guide
both for the year and for the first quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities-Merrill Lynch
Got it. I'll hop out. Thank you.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Steven.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, everybody. So I want to follow up on net interest income. So you guys gave us most of the
components for the 2024 guide. Without net interest income, you probably noticed your stock trading at $7 pre-
market, which I think is a 20- or 25-year low. And it's because all of us are running the math on earning asset
levels, applying the NIM guide, and you get earnings that are down like 40% if you do that. Is that what you guys
are guiding to for 2024?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So the guide we gave – when you look at net interest margin, you see where the loans come down. And with
deposits increasing, that is not exactly where the totals we're seeing, from down 40%. I'm not quite sure exactly
how you came up with that number, but you got to look at some of the security builds as well and the cash on the

balance sheet. So when you put all that together, from a earnings perspective, that sounds much lower than what
we would have anticipated that you'd be coming out with.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
And, Steven, I would just – I would also add to John's commentary that we are solving for Reg YY.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
It's a significant – it's a substantial cash build in the billions of dollars. I think our guide has an additional $7.5
billion on top of 12/31 numbers for 2024. And that's going to really impact until that we right-size our position on
liquidity where we need to be as a Category IV bank, have a negative impact on the margin in the short term.
Over the long term, we hope to normalize our cash positions as we right-size our businesses and focus on
relationship lending, where deposit base comes from the relationship and looking at lines of businesses that are
deposit rich, not deposit starved. That's the journey as we go into this Category IV peer group. And clearly, this is
impacting 2024 for sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. And there will be pressure, no doubt, as we transition from loans to lower yielding securities or cash. So
that absolutely you'll see in that guide on the net interest margin the – that's the transition that's going to happen
in 2024. And then we'll see that start to change as we can continue to grow the portfolio in 2025 and beyond.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
And I would also add, Steven, is that clearly we haven't seen any activity in multifamily CRE, so it's been about a
90% reduction in activity originations. There are no real property activities happening right now. So we have a
relatively low coupon on the book and some billions of dollars that have the possibility of moving either into a
higher coupon and off our balance sheet as we focus on relationship deposit lending. And that's clearly the focus
as we focus our commercial bank efforts, to focus on doing commercial lending, but more importantly, reallocating
our resources to businesses and lines of businesses that have a unique return perspective as a commercial bank
– full service commercial bank. So it's prudent to expect that a lot of these larger relationships that we have that
are not depository relationships will end up gravitating off the balance sheet, probably to the government over
time as rates reset themselves. And we have the ability to move on those low coupons off balance sheet as we
right-size our position as a full service commercial bank.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
So if I put together everything you guys just said, why not just give us what you think net interest income will be in
2024, so we're not all guessing and maybe your stock won't trade down to $7? Like, John, why don't you just tell
us where you – you might be wrong, because you said – basically, we do. We just took earning assets. We
applied your margin. We go – said, okay, this is where NII is, falling out with the other mid-points and it's down

substantially. You're saying it's not that, but you just cut the dividend. Maybe do your shareholders a favor and tell
us what do you think NII will be in 2024. You know better than we do because you know what was impacted fully
in the quarter. There's certain actions you took which didn't fully impact the quarter. So why not just...

Category IV bank strategy. We were well-positioned at the closing of Flagstar at the end of last year and an
opportunity came up to acquire Signature Bank. We took advantage of that opportunity. We're very grateful to
have the FDIC approve that transaction and we're in a different perspective when it comes to our peer group.
These necessary steps need to happen in respect to rightsizing ourselves around these category peers. And
clearly, going forward, we're focusing on building the bank in the market where we said itself fully understands the
strategy. We appreciate your commentary on guide. We wanted – we felt it was prudent for us to give some
guidance for the full year. As you know, Steven, you've been covering us for a long time. We will be giving
quarterly guide. We want to extend that. But as John indicated, a lot of this is significant cash balances at a slight
negative carry that's impacting the drag on the margin. And as we reset ourselves into the future, we believe that
the market will truly understand the expectations of our Category IV expectations both the capital build, which has
driven off the dividend adjustment, along with the guidance that we have, which is we feel it's something that we
felt more transparent as going out a full year, not just the quarter, to show where our CET1 expectations will be at
the end of 2024 and more importantly, right-size ourselves for the future as we build out a new Category IV
expectations.

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Hey. Good morning, guys. Just one on the expense side. Where do you guys anticipate finishing the year roughly
just on a quarterly basis? I know you talked about being elevated in the first part of the year as you go through
your integrations. And if you can talk about – and sorry if I missed it, but the updated timing on the Signature
integration would be great.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So the updated timing, we pushed the Signature integration into 2025 just to ensure we have minimal
customer impact and make sure that we've gone through the Flagstar integration process that we're still on track
for here in February, get through that integration. So that's why you'll see a little bit less of a cost save in 2024. So
your run rate at the end of 2024 will be a little bit higher. Yes, we've guided that the first quarter is typically a
higher quarter for us, especially in compensation and benefits, and as well as the systems conversion will happen
in February. So you will see the first quarter be the higher quarter. But from a trend perspective, the fourth
quarter, when you're going into 2025 will be in that lower end of the range that we gave on an annualized basis
with the start of the year at the higher end of the range.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then just on the credit analysis that you've done for this quarter, it sounds like you're
assuming stable rates through year end and I'm assuming that that incorporates all the repricing you're expecting

in the multifamily book through year end. So it's kind of a catch all for everything that you're looking at through
2024. Is that right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Dave, I want to be clear on that. We did a deep dive in Q4 and we assumed rates that are at the current level in
Q4. We did not anticipate the forward curve adjusting downwards. So we took that into account when we looked
at the ACL to establish the risk in respect of repricing. I believe we have about $3 billion, John, [indiscernible]
(00:27:47) $3 billion coming due to reprice in 2024.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Multifamily, $3.4 billion.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So when you take that into account, as far as what that impacts, these loans are going from a very low coupon to
the market. [ph] Most (00:27:59) customers decide to lock in at fixed rate versus keep the floating rate as they
make the decision. Last year, 80%, would be more like 90% were taking SOFR options. At the beginning of –
actually, towards the tail end of 2023, it was more like 75% and some of them were grabbing the fixed rate option.
So it's more compelling for them to take a fixed rate option now. But the rate is still high compared to the current
coupon that they're coming out of. I will tell you with specificity, customers are waiting on the sidelines. There's
not a lot of activity. I indicated that 90% reduction in the business, people are on the sidelines, they're expecting
that rates will move in the back half of 2024 and they'll make their long-term decisions in the next round of
refinancing.
And as I indicated very clearly, we anticipate the focus on relationship deposit lending. So in the event we have a
non-relationship loan coming at a 3% coupon coming off the books, they'll probably end up in the government,
unless they want to be a full service commercial bank client with the bank. That will gravitate our concentration to
multifamily down significantly assuming that there not going to be a full service relationship with the company.
That is the strategy going forward. It's going to be relationship lending. And clearly, we have an opportunity to
take a very low coupon off the portfolio, assuming there's a shift in customer sentiment to lock in the next round of
financing, which many of our customers are focusing in the second half of 2024.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
So with your bumped up classified loan balance, that assumes all the repricing that you're expecting for this year
and where you see those debt service coverage ratio is going based on the rates that you're seeing today. Is that
right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah. That's not on the forward curve. That's at this...

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
...fourth quarter, so...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
And those two options, the fixed option is still 2.50% over 5 and then the SOFR is 2.50% over SOFR. Is that right,
those two repricing options?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Just to be clear, we assumed they all went to the SOFR option, so the more punitive option, because there's
conservatism there. We do not take their fixed rate option as an option. So we went more conservative and
looked at [indiscernible] (00:29:57) everyone arrive at SOFR curve, but still they decide to lock in the next round
of refinancing, which also stress the debt service coverage ratio. So SOFR versus the fixed rate option is more
punitive.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
And more recently, they've been going into the fixed rate option, right, because that's the least punitive option?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. The activity has been very, very slow than what we've indicated. Probably towards the back end of the fourth
quarter of last year, more like 25% of them are locking in some fixed rate terms, but still a high percentage of
them going to [ph] roll (00:30:26) SOFR with the expectation rates are going to be projected to go low in 2024.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Got it. And where's the multifamily reserve now? How much provision went into the multifamily book versus the

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Casey Haire with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Casey.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So question on the 10% CET1 target. I kind of reiterate what Steve was
talking about with the PPNR guide relative to consensus. And I'm coming out at like [ph] $875 million (00:31:24)
for next year, which I know you guys are talking about the balance sheet loans down, so you get some
deleveraging on the risk weighted asset front. But basically, to get to that 10%, that 90 bps of CET1 build, credit is
going to – provision is going to have to be de minimis by my math. So kind of, again, want to address what are
you guys baking in for provision to get to that 10% level and is that aggressive?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, if you look at the provision that we took in the fourth quarter, we're not – we're expecting that that
covers the emerging risks and the portfolio that we have currently. As you know, through CECL, external factors,
changes in the portfolio, macroeconomic changes is going to impact what our provision is going forward. So
historically, if you look at where our provisions have been, they have not been as big as, of course, we took in the
fourth quarter. We are very comfortable with the early delinquencies that we're seeing. And those trends have not
dramatically jumped up. So when you look at that concept of where the provision can be, will flow through, of
course, our CECL models and go through that process. But yeah, there's not a – anywhere near as a significant
provision as we saw in the third and the fourth quarter combined in 2024 that we're expecting right now given
what we're seeing in the portfolio and in the portfolio dynamics. We do appreciate that substandard and criticized
loans, of course, could still increase from here. And that's something that we will manage through as we go
forward. But when we're looking at that potential, that's what we've tried to capture in our CECL modeling with the
facts that we know right now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Hey, Casey, it's Tom. [indiscernible] (00:33:12) obviously, the dividend adjustment getting back to accretive of

That's right. As well as the shrink in RWA as we're taking loans down and we're growing it with cash and 0%
securities to a lesser extent, of course, 20% securities in the Fannie and Freddie space.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. So of the criticized assets in office and in multifamily, it looks – collectively, it looks at about $4 billion. How
much of that is coming due in 2024?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
From a maturity perspective, it's a very, very low number. From an option perspective, it's a very manageable
amount because when you look kind of through why it would be substandard is it was coming through in that year
bucket that Tom mentioned, so when we're looking at repricing risk, a lot of the substandard category would be
the stuff that's coming through in the next 12 months from a repricing perspective. So when we look at –
especially on the multi side, those would be coming up to their option dates, a large portion of that number. And
that's due to the fact that that's how we're capturing that repricing risk, is that's getting to that 1.0% or – just over
or just under 1.0% coverage ratio.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Oh, good – hey. Good morning, Tom and John. The slide mentioned the goodwill impairment test. And I know in
the past when banks have had to write off goodwill, it's led to the dividend. I assume this is a little bit reverse order
where you cut the dividend first and may impair intangibles, the goodwill going forward, is that kind of the right
way to read it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, we're in the middle of evaluating the goodwill on our balance sheet and going through the process to see
and evaluate if there is any impairment of goodwill. As you know, that goodwill stems from transactions back to
2003. But we will evaluate that based on the facts in the fourth quarter and what we're looking at now as part of
our impairment analysis, and we'll make that decision.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. But if you were to impair it, would there be any subsequent action you think would need to happen, I guess
is the question.

John J. Pinto A

No, from a capital – from a regulatory capital ratio, the goodwill impairment wouldn't impact regulatory capital
ratios. So there's not anything else that I would expect.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then maybe, Tom, for you, whether it's at 50% or 40% cut to numbers, we can work through our
numbers. But the ROE is going to be, by my math, kind of mid to upper single digits. How do we think about just
the ROE construct of this company now that you're through [ph] $100 billion (00:36:08), understanding you've got
some near-term headwinds? But how do you think about ROE?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good question. I mean, obviously, 2024 is going to be the year of the Category IV [ph] comparisons (00:36:19) for
us. We have some heavy lifting to focus on regarding balance sheet metrics, the ACL, which we built up
significantly, the dividend adjustment [ph] with both (00:36:28) CET1. But going forward, we think about the long-
term prospects of the business model. The company is in a unique position to compete. We're focused on being
within the median peer group over time. And we're gravitating with a significant enhanced liquidity position as a
result of Reg YY. That's really driving the margins under pressure in 2024, as we reset the cost structure, as we
integrate the systems, the processes and build out the businesses, and we focus on businesses that have higher
returns to the company. We focus on relationship banking. We would like to be in the median peer group over
time. It's not going to happen in 2024, but that's the strategy over the longer term as the market understands the
longer-term strategy to be a Category IV bank, as our peer group has changed dramatically. Going from $90
billion prior to the acquisition of Signature in March into the right and catapulted into the $100 billion club, we have
some balance sheet items that we need to focus on.
And we believe we were focused in the Q4 to address some of those items. The capital build we talked about,
that was going to be about operating effectively as institution with enhanced financial standards and risk
governance framework that's necessary as we roll out this Category IV bank. And over time, if you think about the
median peer group over time, that's what we'll strive for. It's not going to be a 2024 story. It's going to be a long-
term story. And hopefully, the market will truly understand the long-term story as we reset ourselves as a
Category IV bank.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 31-Jan-2024
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Thanks. Good morning. John, I know you talked a little bit about the migration of criticized assets. What are your
thoughts that has to happen on those? And again, what did you recognize that could go wrong from here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So when you look – yeah. When you at the migration, a lot of it will do partially to interest rates. So depending on
what happens to the five-year part of the curve, that can change dramatically the trajectory of especially the
multifamily book. We're seeing the loans that hit their option date take that floating rate option. That is not the
typical spot that these borrowers want to be. So depending on what happens with rates, we can see some
movement pretty quickly in that portfolio from a paying off perspective, or just the rerating of that portfolio. As
rates start to drop and the payment shock gets less and less and we start to see more and more information on
2023 financials and how the cash flows and the net operating income is coming on, that'll start the trend of getting
these closer and closer to out of the criticized buckets. That's kind of the thought process we're looking at is it's
dependent on interest rates and where they're headed. Given the trend we're starting to see now, we're hoping
that that's abated and we could see less of that repricing risk on the customers.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I just want to reiterate, the magnitude of what we've seen historically with the customers is that running in place,
we were doing $8 billion a year in net originations as a company and we ran in place. The growth was in mid-
single-digits net loan growth and when we were standalone NYCB franchise focusing on multifamily lending. Last
year, our originations are, like I indicated, down 90%. We did about $100 million versus [ph] $800 million
(00:39:39), a very small number, $800 million.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
$800 million.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So that's a significant drop of activity. If things what you really focus on the next round of refinancing and locking
in your longer-term funding scenario as a client, they're on the sidelines and they're going to focus on what's the
next 5- to 10-year financing deal that they'll tend to look at. And we feel very strongly that many customers are
focusing on back half of 2024 to make that longer-term decision, with the expectation that the Fed is in a position
to pivot, which will have a position on our customers to take advantage of long-term financing. Right now, they
lock in a fixed rate coupon. It's more attractive than the SOFR option. And many customers still choose the SOFR
option as they're looking to make those decisions as we go into the back half of 2024. We talked about the $3
billion coming due. Last year, most of those loans are SOFR. We see a little bit of a shift to fixed rate. At the same
time, there's a significant appetite by the agencies to take these types of loans. And we're going to be very
focused to right-size our position to ensure that relationship lending stays on the book and non-relationship
lending will move outside of the portfolio as we reduce our exposure to this area and put our cash flows into
businesses that have higher returns as a firm.

Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Tom, thanks. That's helpful background. And just a follow-up, I guess, is do any of your borrowers have
alternatives outside of the banking industry? Could they go to alternative funds or is that interest rate simply too
great for them to consider?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Great point. I mean, look, the government is open for business. There are huge appetite for this product mix. The
agency is always one of our largest competitors. There's other bank and competition as well as some of the
largest banks in the country. We're pricing our risk accordingly. We feel very strongly that it's going to be a
relationship driven model that will focus on true customer relationships. And ultimately, our largest competitor is
Fannie and Freddie. And they have probably close to collectively $200 billion of an appetite on an annual basis.
There hasn't been any activity. Last year was the lowest activity we've seen – actually lower even during the
pandemic. So we're in a unique position given the fact that there's no activity. But when activity does pick up and
rates do tend to move, customers will find the best vehicle. And the government is very accommodative there.

Lee Matthew Smith A
Senior Executive Vice President & President-Mortgage, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Sure. I mean I think Tom is right. Yeah, from a warehouse lending point of view, as you know, we're the
second largest warehouse lender. If you look at the mortgage market in Q4, it was down 12%, but our warehouse
and MSR outstandings were flat. And I think we benefited from dislocation in the market. And we've grown market
share from a mortgage finance point of view. And we're also leveraging those relationships from a deposit point of
view. So as mentioned before, we picked up a cash and treasury management team as part of the Signature
acquisition. And they're working very closely with our warehouse team and our mortgage team to leverage
deposits from our [ph] TPOs (00:43:54), warehouse borrowers, MSR borrowers, and the MSR owners we
subservice for. And right now, we're probably generating anywhere from $9 billion to $11 billion of deposits from
that mortgage ecosystem that we touch.

So maybe let's put it this way. Is there a commercial real estate to total capital ratio you guys are targeting longer
term that we should think about going forward here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
No. I mean, look, if you carve out multifamily, I think our CRE ratio is probably in the mid – low hundreds. Is that
right, John, low hundreds? So, when you look at our legacy multifamily portfolio, which we've been doing for
multiple decades and we have a long track record of success there, we're going to look at, like I indicated very
specifically, relationship deposit lending. So as we look at the marketplace, we have the lowest interest rate we've
had in our public life. That's going to have to make a decision in the out quarters and out years ahead. We are
going to be very prudent to manage that risk and manage the CRE concentrations and move it into higher yielding
businesses assuming these customers are not depositors. It's going to be deposit driven. That's going to be a
significant shift on our concentration by that business strategy as becoming a full service commercial bank.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And maybe just one on office here. I mean, obviously a big driver of the reserve build. As you guys stress
test that portfolio, does it – is this – do we think about this as a true up to the office reserve allocation or do you –
should we expect further reserve build up this level?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So we did a really – as Tom mentioned earlier, really deep dive on the office portfolio and really took into account
some of the more recent appraisals we're seeing and what we're seeing in that sector and really tried to capture
that risk in that portfolio. So the 800% coverage – the 800 basis points of coverage that we have there, we're
comfortable with right now. We still have two loans that are the same loans we talked about in the third quarter
that are sitting in non-accrual. We haven't seen any other significant trends from a delinquency perspective yet in
that portfolio. So we're comfortable with where we are now. We'll continue to revisit it, of course, as we get
additional appraisals in for properties that have been rated, that have been criticized. But as of now, we're

comfortable with where that is. And at an 8% coverage ratio, I think we've captured a lot of the risk in that portfolio
that we've seen so far.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning. On the capital side, can you talk a little bit more about how we should think about RWA
migration from here? So I know you're bringing your loans down as we move through 2024. But at the same time,
as some of these criticized assets move into NPLs, is there another push on RWA, is there another denominator
effect for capital that we should be thinking about next year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, as – if non-accruals do increase, then, yeah, we will go to 150% from an RWA perspective. But the
big benefit that we're seeing from an RWA reduction is the actual loan portfolio reducing because the additions on
the asset side and cash and securities, as we mentioned earlier, are at 0% when we're looking at cash, of course,
Ginnie securities at 0% and to a much lesser extent, some Fannie and Freddies at 20%. So that's the major items
in the RWA walk, as you mentioned. It's the offset between any changes that we're estimating in non-accrual
compared to that more significant loan decline and RWA decline from the loan portfolio since there is no pickup
on the security side there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And then on the percentage of book that you've scrubbed, you're at current valuations. There haven't been
many transactions. There hasn't been much price discovery. So how hard do you think you've hit valuations here
as you build reserves in that multifamily as well as the office book?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
In the office book, I mean, we've looked at not only some transactions. As you mentioned, there's not a lot in the
marketplace, but we have looked at the actual appraisals that we're getting and looking at the percentage change
peak to trough and what those appraisals are and using that from a qualitative perspective to add to our office
reserves. On the multifamily portfolio, as we mentioned, we took rates where they are now, took the more punitive
structure that the option loans could turn into, which is the SOFR plus 2.50% and hit that along with any potential
amortization that can come in place. So we really think we hit the portfolio from a repricing perspective on the
multi side, especially for those loans coming over the next 12 months.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Dave.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Smith Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Good morning. The actions you're taking to tighten up from a regulatory perspective affect the pace of the private
banking build out at all or is there the earn backs you're expecting there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So obviously, we are highly regulated and we're focused on enhanced prudential standards. But in respect to
Signature and the teams that we built, they're doing a phenomenal job. As I indicated in my prepared remarks,
they've had a great year. They really had stability for March. We're very excited about the stability. And more
importantly, they had growth, $1.5 billion net growth, and the teams are geared up. The First Republic team
started onboarding and focusing on relationship and white glove service. Reggie Davis, do you want to expand on
some of the initiatives that we have working with the teams, if you want to expand upon that as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Reginald E. Davis A
Senior Executive Vice President & President-Consumer & Corporate Banking, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. And I actually want to speak more to the banking group because the private bank consists of the legacy
First Republic teams and legacy Signature teams, but we're now under one envelope. So I kind of want to talk
about the success and some of the progress that we've made in 2023. We've essentially taken four distinct teams
and created one highly focused banking organization. And as Tom mentioned earlier, we created a single brand
and we launched that brand internally in midyear. And that's something the teams have really rallied around. I
think the brand represents the current capabilities and future aspirations of the combined company. We've also
completed restructuring of the banking group in total. So the new structure has some synergies, quite frankly,
between the four legacy institutions, taking advantage of each other's strengths. And part of creating that new
structure was reducing the number of client coverage models from 10 to 3. So now, we operate as the private
bank, the commercial banking group, and the consumer banking group. And as a result of that, and I think Tom
mentioned this, we discontinued operations in several legacy businesses to further focus on relationship banking.
And so the translation of that is if we're going to use our balance sheet, we're going to use it to get deposits.
And so we combined – also combined two separate branch teams from legacy Flagstar and NYCB under one
leadership structure. We introduced common routines, common client engagement models, common tools across
the entire network. And we've also accelerated our – onto a common platform with common AI tools across the
entire branch network. We've also combined our retail investment business into one platform, one structure under
one leader. And then we've also combined our wealth management organization with a clear mandate around
teaming up with both the commercial bank and the private bank for greater relationship experienced. And so the
legacy First Republic teams and Signature teams are under one leader. And together, they comprise the private

banking group. And as Tom said, their performance has really been stellar this year. They've recaptured after all
the deposits that we lost in March and April timeframe, which is about $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion. In addition, the
DDA portion of that book has been rock solid at $11 billion. And that's essentially unchanged because that
represents the operating accounts that are very much reflective of the relationship nature of those deposits. And
then also our retail bank only lost 3% of the deposits in March and April timeframe. And quite frankly, we've
captured all of that back as well. So those two businesses, the private bank and the retail bank, are deposit
engines for the company.
And I might add from a Signature perspective, we haven't lost anything. And the addition of the Signature book
has actually helped us from a mix perspective in our deposit book. It shifted it from a 39% pre-Signature to 25%
CD, which is actually more in line with our peers. So we feel really good. Our deposits actually grew up 5%
quarter-over-quarter, and that's a lot – has a lot to do with the growth embedded in our retail bank and in the
legacy Signature book. And we expect that to continue, quite frankly. We're starting to see more and more
momentum and more success as those teams are part of our larger organization. So all good new stories.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Smith Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Okay. So not looking to really take your foot off the gas there yet?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I think the reality is that deposit, deposit, deposit. We have a great opportunity with an experienced bankers that
are welcome here. And the energy, as Reggie indicated in that long winded answer, which is a lot of the positive
momentum. It's a lot of positive momentum. The conversion is happening in a few weeks from now. We're excited
about that one platform, one bank, one brand. But what's exciting about is that they're focusing on their white
glove service, it's what they do. It's not really a lending model here. This is about deposit opportunity to service
the client specifically in the middle market position.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Smith Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Okay. And then on capital, do you view the 10% target at the end of this year to be an ending point? Or would you
be looking to ultimately get your capital ratios higher?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Ultimately, as we think about capital, we were very clear in our public announcement this morning along with our
views is that we want to be within the peer group. We have a new peer group that we have to attain to. And that's
clearly the focus here. So as we gravitate to that double-digit CET1, the dividend adjustment plus what we'll call a
conservative view of guidance with respect to our balance sheet, we'll generate increase in capital quarter-over-
quarter with the expectation over time to be within the peer group. That's the plan over the long term. Clearly, we
have a long history of strong payment and dividend. We have to go through the capital planning process. This is
our first submission under the Reg YY with the Fed that's going to happen in April. And we want to prepare for
that accordingly.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Brody.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning. I wanted just to ask within the deposit book how much of the increase in CDs was brokered
CDs this quarter. And then the uptick in the wholesale borrowings, I'm assuming that's all FHLB, what's the
remaining capacity that you have for FHLB borrowings at this point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So from a FHLB borrowing perspective, we have as of 12/31 significant capacity to borrow. And we'll use that to
continue to build our liquidity here in the first quarter to, as we mentioned earlier, prepare for Reg YY. So we're
very comfortable with the on balance sheet liquidity and the contingent liquidity we have behind that. From the
broker deposit question, broker deposits were up about $1 billion. Broker CDs were up about $1 billion quarter-
over-quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. So we can – the influx in the CD, so the rest came from the retail network.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. The rest came from the retail network. We actually raised about $2 billion over about two months. And that
– I mean – again, that reflects the strength of our retail franchise. About 72% of that were new to bank and about
28% were existing relationship. And we're able to cross sell about 15% in on checking accounts. And that's going
to set us up for next year in terms of converting some of those single product new clients into DDA accounts,
relationship accounts. And so it's not only – it's good for the balance sheet, obviously, but long term it also will add
to a cheaper funding base. We feel really good about that. Plus, 6,700 new clients.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Great. And then just on the deposit front again, I guess the 32.7% of the deposits are uninsured, but you
also have escrows down this quarter for seasonality. I guess I wanted to ask is the 32.7% uninsured a good read
on what percent of the deposit base is institutional clients at this point? If not, what percent of the deposit base is
institutional clients? And then secondarily, we saw at least one other bank that went through some stress on the
deposit front earlier this year, signed NDAs with some of its larger depositors. Did you guys consider doing

anything like that moving forward with some of your larger depositors so that they can feel good about the health
of the balance sheet?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. When you look at some of those uninsured deposits, they're not all institutional by any stretch. There's
customers in there. There's businesses in there. So that's not the escrow or entirely large balance institutional
deposits. But if you look at the organizations, we had some of – some of those balances from a 15c3 and that
type of money, those types of business, institutional type accounts, we don't have a lot of those deposits at all
anymore. I mean, that deposit base that's uninsured is primarily business type deposits and operating accounts.
And yeah, there's a lot of DDA in there as well.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey. So understanding some of the actions taken this quarter to course correct, there's $100 billion – over $100
billion bank versus some of your similar sized peers. Are there additional capital-related actions to be considered
apart from CET1? So I'm looking at total risk-based capital, 11.8%. Your peers are at 13.5%. Should we be
considering any sort of need for additional sub-debt to kind of get you to that peer range? And if so, when?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, Matt, I do appreciate the question. I will tell you that between forward guide along with the dividend
adjustment and our targets for CET1, we're focusing on that specific area in respect to building capital. Obviously,
we're waiting for the new rules on Basel III. That will come out and will apply to us as a Category IV bank over
time. But no question, the adjustment on our distribution to shareholders along with building out the business and
running a run rate based on our guidance is where we're focused on the capital build. So clearly, that's going to
put us slightly below the table, but with the expectation of building capital over time and accreting capital going
forward.

Okay. And again, understanding that this quarter you took some actions to course correct, could you give us
some balance sheet mix targets once you're done in terms of cash to assets, securities to assets? So where you
would like to be and by when?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Well, the main issue and thought process that we're talking through with this quarter on on-balance sheet
liquidity is just preparing for Reg YY. So if you look at where we were at 12/31 at 18%, with the peers at 25%,
we're going to be in that range. We'll be above 18%. So we're going to get to that 22%, 23% range and get closer
and closer to peers. As you know, our securities portfolio has historically been very small on percentage basis to
total assets. And that securities portfolio is really the main liquidity buffer that we need to keep in place here going
forward. So that's why when we look at that portfolio, it'll be significantly skewed towards zero and 20% risk
weighted assets, high quality liquid assets in order to ensure that we can meet our on-balance sheet liquidity
demands and regulation. So I think we'll be much closer to that 25% range of our peers over time. And we'll get
there in the first and the second quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And when you measure securities, are we talking securities to assets or total assets? Because I'm looking at
9%...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Total assets.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. So 9%...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q

...securities assets today, that's going to near triple by next quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
No, you have cash in there as well, right? So I'm looking at cash and securities as a combined basis as a
percentage of total assets, right? And that's how we manage it. So we manage on-balance sheet liquidity.
Normally, that will be more in the securities portfolio. Given the build-up here, it's starting in cash, and over time,
we'll be putting that out in the securities portfolio.

Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And you assume that the lion's share of whatever you need to do here will be completed by the end of the first
quarter, it's not going to drag out throughout the whole year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
That's right. That is correct.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then going back to the CRE concentration, so when you look at the CRE concentration versus peers,
is it still appropriate to exclude multifamily given the repricing risk? And do the regulators look at it that way? I
know for decade after decade, rent regulated multifamily has been virtually risk free. But post-2019, the rent law
changes and the new paradigm. In the release, in your commentary, you're discussing repricing and credit risk
here. It feels like the CRE concentration including multifamily is the right one to look at, with all due respect.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, it's a fair point. As you know, we're not going to speak specifically on regulatory conversations, but clearly,
we understand our business very well. We also have a focus on looking at CRE concentration as a much lesser
number as we focus on relationship banking. That is the mission of the new Flagstar. We are going to bank
customers that have deposits at the bank and they're full relationship deposits. We have an opportunity here to
significantly take advantage of market conditions and reduce [indiscernible] (01:02:30) concentration, putting into
higher yielding loans, higher margin businesses over time, which are focused on relationship deposit lending.
That is a meaningful statement as we have no activity in the marketplace. If you go back to when we're doing $8
billion, $9 billion a year in originations, we're running flat at 4% to 5% at best to stay flat. So when the market does
react to changes in interest rates and customers look for refinancing, we have a golden opportunity here to take
low yielding coupons off the books, reduce [ph] CRE (01:03:02) concentration materially here, and move that into
higher yielding assets, and obviously focus on our liquidity expectation.
But having a lower compensating balance to the asset is not the focus of the new Flagstar. It's going to be well-
balanced towards relationship deposit lending. That is the focus of the institution on a combined basis going
forward. And we think that given the activity last year, as I indicated, with 90% down, there's no activity in the
market. Although the customer activity that we speak to, they're waiting on the sidelines. And they're going to
react when they feel confident for the next 5 to 10 years of financing for us, that somebody indicated taking fixed

rate loans, some of loans go to the agency now. But the agency has a huge appetite. And when the customer
feels prudent that it's time to lock in the next 5 to 10 years of financing, they will make that decision. And we will
work with our customers for balance sheet purposes. And if it's not a true customer relationship, that will be a
significant reduction to our CRE concentration.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. Over time – I mean, there's a lot of peer comp going on this quarter. Over time, the CRE concentration
need to get to peer levels.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Look, that is a huge business model of ours. We have a great track, we have great customers, we have lots of
relationships on the deposit side who are obviously uniquely different. That's who we are and that goes back to
our roots, but ultimately, we're a new company. We're a commercial bank evolving from the monoline thrift. We're
excited about the lines of businesses we have. We're excited about the opportunity of mortgage ecosystem.
We're excited about what Reggie Davis is doing with his lines of businesses. And we have choices and it can be
based on a return on equity model, which is very different in history, where it was driven off of a monoline
business, which was multifamily CRE. So we're going to reallocate those resources, take advantage of market
conditions, and work with our customers. We feel very strongly that just by the mere fact that the coupon was
coming off the loans, we have an opportunity to move a lot of assets at low coupon to make our balance sheet
stronger and earnings profile better.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Last one from me, the language here around being over $100 billion feels far more urgent today than just a
few months ago. Has something changed on the regulatory front in terms of overall standing or time line to be
ready for new stress testing? Like I said, a lot of peer comparison here. If so, can you give us some updated
timeframe, milestones? I know you mentioned April submission, in terms of being prepared for the first stress test.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Matt, we are – obviously, we're not going to speak specifically about regulatory conversations. We're a highly
regulated institution in an industry that's highly regulated. But the reality is that we do have an April submission.
We've adjusted our capital position significantly as well as the ACL. Those are big steps as we forecast our
submission to the Reg YY. That's an important milestone. As John indicated, we're doing significant work on Reg
YY on balance sheet liquidity. We went into the – we catapulted into the $100 billion club post liquidity crisis in
March. We were preparing for that last year. So, it's [ph] totally (01:05:59) organically. And we – an opportunity
came and we thought it was a great opportunity for building out the conversion from a thrift model to a commercial
bank model. And we are in a unique benchmark now. We're in a different category. There's eight of us that we
benchmark to. And we want to get those ratios in line to a group that makes sense going forward as we run our
business. I think the market will understand what's in front of us.
But more importantly, as we build the new Flagstar, we're excited with the team and the energy as they gravitate
here to become – be part of the [indiscernible] (01:06:29) we made significant changes on the risk side, significant
changes on bringing people in-house as a larger institution. That's the journey that we're focusing on here. So it is
fluid given the situation in respect to the timing because it became a little bit unexpected in March of this year as

we opted to be able to [indiscernible] (01:06:46) and buy Signature Bank through receivership. And now, we have
to make sure that we're in place to be honorable of the fact that we are a Category IV bank. And that's a
regulatory obligation.

ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. So with the sales of the CRE multifamily loans from Signature [indiscernible] (01:07:11) that
basically now completed, how does that impact the expenses from the loss sharing and then the fees, some of
that loan administration income that you had and how we think about that for 2024?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So if you look at those transactions that hit the marketplace, we expect that those loans will transfer off our
servicing platform this quarter entirely. So we will see some loan servicing income a little less than we saw in the
fourth quarter. We'll see some of that come in in the first quarter. That's within the guide that we gave. And then
from a cost save perspective, that some of that information, once we get through the Flagstar integration, some of
those cost saves are in that – the noninterest expense walk that we put together in the slide deck. So that's
included in that number. So from a quarter-over-quarter perspective, we'll see a decline fourth quarter to first
quarter in income from the subservicing. And then by the second quarter, we expect that those loans will have
transferred out so that we will have some cost saves that come out of that and then the income will disappear
there.

Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And then just as a follow up, I know there haven't been many transactions and sounds like you're more focused
on appraisals, but did these sales potentially impact your decisions to add reserves for multifamily and office?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
This is a Signature sale.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 31-Jan-2024
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. No. We – no. A lot of the information we're getting, a lot of it specifically comes from the appraisal we're
seeing in our portfolio. We are looking at market – any market indications that we can get our hands around and
using that as well. So we're taking into account as much information as we can to develop the right qualitative
framework for the – for especially the office portfolio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
So those sales had no impact on the qualitative factor that you're mentioning?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, no, from a – we are looking at information in the marketplace, but specific sales from a portfolio perspective
would not be as important for us to look at as the individual appraised information and individual factors we're
getting on our books.

Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Got it. Thank you.

Operator: Our final question will come from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Thanks for sneaking me in. Just two questions, two important questions, I think. There's some confusion on
this, but did the dividend reduction have anything to do with your outlook for credit, or was it more about looking
peer like and adjusting for the new earnings run rate?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Great question. Let me be crystal clear on this. This is razor focused on looking at the company's long
term-plan and being part of the new Category IV banking institution and having a capital position as we grow it
into a level that were in our peer group. And clearly, the dividend significantly increases that capital position in
2024 and beyond. When you take all of the factors that we talked about between forward guidance and the
dividend adjustment, we get our CET1 to double-digits. That is primarily focused on the rationale there as well as
thinking about the future growth of this company as a Category IV bank. And there's no question that this was a
difficult decision as a firm, but clearly necessary as we re-establish our capital allocation story.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
So really not – it's more about the latter. It's not about your outlook for credit is what you're saying.
