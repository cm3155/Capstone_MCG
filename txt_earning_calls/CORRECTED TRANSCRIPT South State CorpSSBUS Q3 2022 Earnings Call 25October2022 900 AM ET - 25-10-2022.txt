Robert R. Hill Jr.
Executive Chairman, South State Corp.
Good morning. Thank you for the opportunity to kick off the call today. I have just a couple of comments before I
turn the call over to John.
I want to thank our shareholders for your patience the last two years as we have moved through significant
changes at SouthState. The timing to make major changes has turned out to be very good as we have enhanced
our size, our scale and great businesses, our efficiency, and rebuilt our technology platform. As the economy now
approaches a more uncertain and turbulent time ahead, these are the times when SouthState will really stand out.
The rebuilding of the company, along with our core funding, conservative credit culture, and great markets have
us well-positioned for the road ahead.
Thank you for your time today. I'll now turn the call over to John.

John C. Corbett
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Thanks, Robert. Good morning, everybody. I'll make some brief comments about the operating environment and
our third quarter results. Afterwards, Will can share more detail about the financials, and then we'll take your
questions.
Before we talk about the bank, it's important to take a step back and reflect on the macro environment. Over the
last two years, the United States government flooded the banking system with excess deposits and basically
provided a pandemic bailout with the PPP program and support for consumers. In that pandemic environment,
every bank in the country was deposit-rich and had near-perfect asset quality metrics. Now, suddenly, the tables
are turned as the Fed dramatically raises rates and embarks on QT, good old-fashioned relationship deposits,
liquidity, and credit discipline will drive the distinctions in bank performance over the next two years. This is an
environment where SouthState should shine.
Let me mention a few of our third quarter highlights. We're pleased to have two sequential quarters of very strong
revenue growth, operating leverage, and loan growth. Our earnings ramp has been steep, and the momentum is
obvious. Our PPNR per share is up 47% from the same period last year. In the third quarter, our NIM expanded
significantly, operating leverage improved 8%, and that drove our efficiency ratio down to 50%. We watched our
NIM expand 43 basis points in the third quarter after expanding 35 basis points in the second quarter. That's
pretty dramatic, 78 basis points of NIM expansion in just two quarters. And to be clear, that margin expansion is
not the result of actions we took in the last two quarters, but actions we took in 2021 to retain more cash on our
balance sheet than many others. We took the long view and held on to plenty of dry powder to put to work in this
higher rate environment.
As expected, the significant NIM expansion was partially offset by weakness in our capital markets and mortgage
business. Mortgage production remained strong with our focused on purchased mortgages in our growing
southeast markets. But with low gain on sale margins, we decided to hold 78% of the production on balance sheet
and only sold 22%. Total loans grew 13% on an annualized basis and were evenly split between the commercial
and retail bank. Despite the recession fears, our asset quality metrics remained very clean, and we had net
recoveries in the quarter.
Hurricane Ian hit Southwest Florida last month as a fierce Category 4 storm. Now, that's an area of the state
where we don't have branches. After the hurricane devastated Fort Myers, it moved slowly through our franchise

in Central Florida, Northern Florida and on up to Charleston as a Category 1 storm, dumping over a foot of rain in
some places.
So, the primary impact to our customers and employees were power outages and flooding in Central and
Northern Florida. We sustained very little structural damage, and the power was restored within a week. As we
examined our exposure to the hurricane, we determined that less than 1% of our loans are located in the hardest
hit areas of Lee, Collier and Charlotte counties. And so far, we've received very few requests for payment
deferrals.
As I mentioned, our granular deposits will be a differentiator for us in a rising rate environment. With an
abundance of cash on the balance sheet, we've lagged the Fed on the way up. Our deposit beta is 3% so far this
cycle, and our total deposit cost is only 11 basis points.
Average deposit balances declined about 4% annualized, but that still left us with about $2.5 billion in cash and
$5.5 billion in available for sale securities. So, that's about 18% of the balance sheet that's liquid. I'll point out
three areas that drove the end-of-period change to our deposits. First, we mentioned on our last earnings call the
predictable fluctuation of deposits in the payroll business. If the calendar quarter ends on a Friday, deposits
temporarily drop about $500 million. In this quarter, the third quarter did end on a Friday, so that's why it's better
to look at average deposit balances when comparing quarters. And secondly, as we previously announced, we
consolidated a number of branches in the third quarter which accounted for a portion of the reduction. And third,
with the increase in rates, we worked with some of our high net worth clients to purchase about $275 million of
treasuries through our Wealth Management division and we're going to continue to work one on one with our
valuable relationship clients while at the same time managing the appropriate amount of balance sheet liquidity.
As we look ahead, we are cautious about the economy in 2023, and we share the concern of many that a
recession may be around the corner. It's just hard to imagine a scenario where the Federal Reserve is moving this
fast and something, maybe something we don't see now, but something doesn't break in the economy. But even
with this uncertainty, we like the hand we've been dealt on a relative basis. We've got excellent funding, surplus
capital, and we operate in four of the six fastest growing states in the country.
Regardless of the environment, our team will show up to work each day and we're going to continue to deliver
exceptional client service and build franchise value one customer at a time.
With that, I'll turn it over to Will to give you more detail on the financial results.

Thanks, John. As you noted, it was another encouraging quarter for SouthState on several fronts. We had record
PPNR and PPNR per share, driven by another [ph] solid (08:21) margin increase. We had a low deposit beta with
a very moderate decline in balances. We had good expense control and solid growth, with some weakness in a
couple of our non-interest income business lines, not entirely unexpected in this rate environment. And credit
metrics had remained solid.
Slide 12 shows our net interest margin over the last five quarters. Net interest income of $358 million was up $44
million from Q2, with core net interest income of $349 million up $47 million from the prior quarter. Tax equivalent
NIM was $3.55 or $3.46 on a core basis, up 43 basis points from Q2. Total cost of deposits of 11 basis points was
up 5 basis points from the prior quarter. While we hope to continue to outperform in this metric, we do, of course,

expect our beta to rise over the cycle as deposit competition heats up. Non-interest income was down $11 million
from Q2, primarily driven by a $7 million decline in correspondent and a $3 million decline in mortgage revenue.
In the mortgage business, as shown on slide 14, we had production of almost $1.1 billion in the quarter, but only
22% of the volume was sold in the secondary market, leading to a decline in secondary income. I'll note that our
retail mortgage production year-to-date is down 6% from last year versus an industry decline of approximately
46%, according to [indiscernible] (09:54).
For the correspondent division, as noted on slide 16, the sizeable and rapid move in rates continues to pose a
challenge for demand for fixed income securities, in spite of the attractive rates now available relative to the last
couple of years. Interest rate swap demand was also down a bit in the quarter, with such revenues comparable to
last year's third quarter. Non-interest expense of $227 million was up $1 million from Q2, a bit better than
anticipated. With that revenue growth and relatively flat NIE, our efficiency ratio dropped to 50%.
On the balance sheet, loans were up 13.3% annualized from Q2. The highest percentage growth was in single
family residential, up 34% annualized, followed by C&I up 17% and investor CRE up 12% annualized. Line
utilization across various loan types remained flat with prior quarters and still below pre-pandemic levels by 5% or
more.
John discussed some of the items impacting our decline in ending deposits. On an average basis, our deposits
were down just under $400 million or approximately 4% annualized. I'll also note that our ending deposits are
slightly ahead of where we had budgeted them for September 30.
With respect to credit, we provisioned $24 million for the quarter in spite of two basis points in net recoveries. $1.9
million of our charge-offs were DDA losses. So, net loan recoveries were closer to 4 basis points or 5 basis
points.
In our CECL model, we continue to use a more negative economic scenario weighting than baseline or
consensus would indicate. Our asset quality metrics remain very good at this point, as noted on slide 24, but we
remain cautious about the economy. [indiscernible] (11:49) allowance plus reserve for unfunded commitments
moved up 5 basis points in the quarter to 1.31%.
With respect to capital on slide 25, our risk-based ratios remain strong with CET1 of 11% and total risk-based
capital of 12.9%. And our leverage ratio improved approximately 30 basis points with the quarter's capital
formation and slight reduction in the size of the balance sheet. The move in interest rate and resultant move in
AOCI continues to negatively impact our TCE ratio and our TBV per share. With our TCE ratio ending at 6.7%
and our TBV per share declining to $37.97. Excluding AOCI, our TCE ratio would have been 8.3% and our TBV
per share would have been $47.44.
John, I'll turn it back to you.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Michael Rose from
Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning. Maybe we could just start on the NIM and the kind of the rate sensitivity. Obviously, it's continued
to kind of come down here a little bit, and sorry if I missed this in the beginning, but just given the loan growth and
the low deposit betas, can you just kind of talk about maybe some near-term expectations for the NIM? And I'm
sorry if I missed this, but what outlook – what rate outlook you guys are – have assuming support curve or
something else just as we move through the next couple of quarters? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Hey, Michael. It's Steve. Let me walk you through a couple of those assumptions and how we're thinking about
the next 15 months or so. Really three major assumptions I'll walk through, and then sort of kind of give guidance
at the end.
The assumption number one is just the size of the deposits and interest-earning assets. I think this past quarter, it
was a little over $40 billion. Over the last several earnings call, you'll remember, we've given you guidance that
we want to try to keep deposits flat through the end of 2023, which would keep earning assets flat. We continue to
reiterate that same guidance and based on the loan growth forecast, our deposit forecast, our loan-to-deposit
ratio would probably climb from somewhere around 76%, 77% where it is today to the end of 2023 around 80%.
So, that's kind of how we think about from the size of the balance sheet management somewhere in the $40
billion earning asset range.
The second assumption is just around interest rates. Last earnings call we did in July, the Moody's consensus
forecast was for the Fed funds to peak out at 3.5%. Of course, there's been a big change there. The new Moody's
consensus forecast has the Fed funds peaking in 2023 at 4.75% so there was a large move in expectations in the
third quarter.

In our modeling – so, that's all that built in our modeling. The deposit beta, we've talked about this before, the
page 20 speaks to both our previous cycle beta, deposit beta, as well as our current cycle beta. And what it
shows on the Investor Deck on page 20 is that our deposit beta was 24% last cycle, cycle to-date. And so far, this
cycle at 3%. And our assumption continues to be that this cycle will play out the same way as last cycle, so a 24%
beta. So, as we think about deposit costs, when we think about our interest rate forecast, we would expect our
cost-to-deposits to get to around [ph] 110 to 120 (16:29) sometime by the same time next year. So, if you think
about that, that 4.5% increase in rates, 24% beta, and then our original deposit costs, that could – should get you
somewhere in there. And as we think about the next four quarters, really thinking about that ratably, that 1%
change or so over the next four quarters is sort of a radical change.
So, to kind of sum it all up, based on the assumptions of the balance sheet size, interest rate forecast, and our
deposit beta, we would expect margin expansion from here and this past quarter at $355 million, we would think
that the margin would range somewhere between $360 million and $380 million through the end of 2023. So,
hopefully, that tells you the assumptions and sort of the big picture of how we got to those assumptions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Perfect. A lot of details as usual, Steve. Maybe just this one follow-up question, [ph] probably sticking with you
(17:31). You guys have held the correspondent book revenue stream pretty consistent over the past couple of
quarters, but it did come off – again, this quarter, it did come off this quarter. Can you just give some greater color
there just on kind of how the business works? And then, maybe just as we move through this higher interest rate
environment, how the different pieces of the business you would expect to work over the next couple of quarters?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Sure. Let me take a big picture approach and then drill down on the correspondent, and maybe I'll tie all that
together. Fee income this quarter was $77 million or about 0.67% of average assets. Our prior guidance that we
had last quarter was between 0.7% and 0.8% of average assets. And we said that we'd probably be at the lower
end of the range until we got through some of this interest rate hiking till the end of 2022. At that point in time, we
gave the guidance for terminal Fed funds rate was 3.5%. But because we've had this large move in interest rates,
really expectation up another one in the quarter, some of these interest rate-sensitive businesses like mortgage
and correspondent have slowed down from a fee income generation perspective.
So, think about correspondent, our guidance was $24 million to $28 million a quarter. We're low in that guidance,
really the $20 million to $25 million a quarter, until really we get through the Fed stops raising rates. So, if you
think about the puts and takes, our interest rate swap revenue fell this quarter. Fixed income actually fell only
about $1 million, but I would expect fixed income to be more challenging as the Fed continues to raise rates and
that short-term rates and long-term rates all end up about the same. So, I think fixed income will be a little more
challenging. I think the interest rate swap business will get better, but our new guidance for that is somewhere
between $20 million and $25 million until the Fed stops raising rates and we get into a bit more normalized
environment.
So, just to kind of sum up all of that, yeah, so with the next several quarters and until the Fed stops raising rates,
we would expect our non-interest income to average assets to be between 0.6% and 0.7%. As the Fed stops
raising rates when we get into a more normal environment sometime in 2023, we'd expect the NII to average
assets to get back to 0.7% and 0.8%, and kind of act as the hedge as we talk about the net interest income. So,

hopefully, that's helpful guidance as you think through the puts and takes of correspondent and non-interest
income.

Operator: Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Kevin Fitzsimons from D.A. Davidson.
Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Hey. Good morning, everyone.

A
Hi, Kevin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Just wondering if you can talk a little bit about loan growth, how you – how the pipelines look, how you feel about
growth going forward in terms of both what you're seeing in demand, but maybe what you're also implementing in
terms of maybe raising the bar on underwriting or stepping back on certain kind of loan segments? Any color on
that front? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah. Sure. Kevin, it's John. Big picture, I would say that the Fed's rate increases are working. They're slowing
things down, but it takes time. There's a lag effect that's working through the psychology of our clients and our
borrowers. Our pipelines are coming down. From a C&I borrower standpoint, a lot of them are doing fine, but
they're taking kind of a wait-and-see approach. They're still borrowing money, but it's more to replace existing
equipment versus expanding.
On the CRE side, we're in a period here of price discovery. Cap rates are – have been very slow to adjust to the
yield curve, but we're starting to see that bid-ask spread on CRE property starting to widen out. I think there's a
number of folks that were in the development business, the merchant builders, that are preparing to become
owner-managers and what that's going to do, it's going to slow paydowns down.
On the residential side, I think the fundamental question is what kind of house can I buy with a $2,500 a month
payment? In January when rates were 3%, you could borrow $600,000. Today, you can borrow $380,000. So, I
think that is going to cause a real slowdown in the residential side, and we're seeing that in some of the rate loss.
I think the Fed is having and seen the desired effect of the rate increases. So, while loan originations are going to
slow, growth is going to be a little bit different. There are some cross-currents with growth in that number one
payoffs that we've been talking about for two years. I think payoffs are going to start slowing. And there's a
number of loans that we originated the last two years that are still in the fund-up scenario.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2022
So, I do think that growth is not going to slow down as fast as new loan origination slow. So, if we had to give
some guidance, we'd say our fourth quarter estimate would be that we'd be growing loans in the upper single
digits. If we enter into a mild recession in 2023, maybe mid-single digit growth. But ultimately, our goal by the end
of 2023 is probably to put on another $1.5 billion to $2 billion of net loan growth and that gets us to that 80% loan-
to-deposit ratio that Steve talked about if we hold the balance sheet and deposits flat, but that's the macro picture.
We're very, very bullish on the markets on the southeast. They're going to outperform the rest of the country. And
the in-migration that Will talked about, you could see it in the residential numbers. The nation mortgage origination
this year, year-to-date, is down 46%, 47%. We're only down about 6%. That speaks to the strength of the
southeastern job front and in-migration. But that a lot of it's not just retirees. It's just great jobs and great economic
activity in the southeast. I don't know that many people are as aware of what's going on over the last several
years and really in the last couple of years with the automobile industry in the southeast.
We've had just a ton of announcements. I mean, in Georgia, there's a new $5 billion Hyundai plant for electric
vehicles, 8,000 new jobs. The South Koreans just built a new battery plant for electric vehicles north of Atlanta,
2,000 jobs, $1.7 billion investment. Last week, BMW announced an expansion to their plant in Greenville, South
Carolina, $1.7 billion. And we've got a new assembly plant in Huntsville, Alabama with 4,000 new jobs for Mazda
and Toyota. So, the southeast is going to be just fine. And from an underwriting standpoint, we try not to be a
faucet-on, faucet-off lender. We are abiding by our policies right now. And we're stressing the loans we're making
with this new interest rate environment. So, hopefully, that gives you a flavor of what we're seeing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Yeah. That's great, John. Thanks. Just one quick follow-up. I was wondering if – I guess it's understandable we
wouldn't hear as much about it with the deal being closed for a while now. But if you can speak to any
observations on Atlanta Capital in terms of any remaining savings and/or contributions that you're seeing from
them, whether better or less than expected? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah. Yeah. This is John. Our pipeline and production in Georgia have been fantastic. So, we completed the
conversion in July. Conversion went extraordinarily well. We are still continuing to work through the normal
integration issues as the team members get accustomed to the new processes, but they haven't missed a beat
from a loan production growth standpoint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. And Kevin, I'll take it on the savings side. Maybe I'll go ahead and wrap this in the context of sort of the NIE
outlook, and certainly can take further questions on NIE as desired. But we have pretty much essentially gotten
most of the cost savings out through the third quarter. There's still a few that'll trickle in in subsequent quarters
including Q4. And that also goes for the branch consolidations we did. There'll be a little bit more in Q4 than Q3.
But I'd say our guidance for the Q4 NIE still would be where we thought it would be, and that's somewhere in the
low-230s and if we're lucky, maybe down below 230.
This quarter we had a few items moving positively and negatively and we did a little better than we thought in NIE.
One item, of course, is production in the correspondent business lower that drives down some of the commission
compensation expense there, and so depending upon the fluctuations in that business, that'll impact NIE as well.

But also in Q4, we expect there's probably continued incentive accruals that will drive that number up. So, still feel
like Q4, that number we've been guiding towards of low-230s, maybe high-220s, feels like a good number.
And then, looking ahead to next year, I'd say we're still in the process of our budgeting cycle, which is a very
thorough bottoms up process where we review requests for capital in the form of fixed asset dollars, as well as
technology dollars, as well as in terms of investment in people dollars, and make decisions about those requests
based on projected capital returns across the company. So, that's our normal cycle. We're in the middle of it now,
and we'll have better guidance we'll be able to give on NIE when we get to our January call.
But I'll just reiterate that we remain very focused on trying to manage our expenses in every environment,
including one that's got some inflationary pressures like this one. And we've done a good job, I think, this year
with our incentive plans of keeping that front of line with our teams, and hope to do so next year as well.

thinking about that in this rate environment, putting more of that on balance sheet and kind of around funding and
rate paid on the ready mortgage [indiscernible] (29:37).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Sure, Stephen. We talked about our residential portfolio on page 14 and 15 of the deck, and just a couple of
points to make there, and then I'll try to kind of frame all that up. Last quarter, in the third quarter, we produced
about $1.1 billion in production. 78% of that was portfolio. 22% was the secondary. And, of course, 92% was
purchase. So, a lot of this is the refi business is pretty much done.

On page 15, we show a historical look at the portfolio residential growth and shrinkage over the past two-and-a-
half years, and characterized that around gain-on-sale spreads and mortgage rates. The key takeaway, when you
look at that slide, is we've sort of used residential as a balance sheet management tool. When rates are low and
gain-on-sale margins were high back in 2020 and 2021, we sold most of the production and took the fee income.
Lately, when rates have risen and gain-on-sale margins have declined, we've run the portfolio balances over the
last couple of quarters. Since if you kind of take a [indiscernible] (30:57) look, since the December of 2019, we're
at only $450 million in total for 8% over that two-and-a-half-year period.
This quarter, we produced about $825 million of portfolio production. 47% of that was for our professional doctor
program, and we like that credit. We think that's an appropriate place to put – production to put on our balance
sheet. Having said all that, residential production will flow along with a lot of other production. This year, we'll
probably do somewhere in the $4.5 billion dollar range relative to production of which the entire period will be
about 70% of [indiscernible] (31:43) portfolio.
If you look at next year, our preliminary forecast, and we'll continue to get sharpened up, but it's probably more
like $3 billion, which is about what we did in 2019 before we had the pandemic. And so, we're thinking that's
probably more like 60% portfolio, 40% secondary. So, just if you think about the balance sheet, we're going to
probably produce more as we get into 2023 just because of the shock and rates, and we have to kind of work
through that period for the next 6 to 9, 12 months or whatever before rates start stabilizing and production get
back to where it might have been this year. Is that helpful?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
That's extremely helpful. Thanks, Steve. And then maybe a quick follow-up on Michael's earlier question around
kind of the reduction in asset sensitivity. Is that primarily a reduction just as you've deployed more of the excess
liquidity and you do expect betas to move higher from here? What's the main driver around that kind of quarter-
over-quarter change in the modeling?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. The main driver in that is our assumption around deposit beta. If you look at it from the first quarter, our
NIM was 2.77%. This quarter, 3.55%, so we're up 78 basis points. And our deposit beta is only at 3%. So, if you
just run the math and say, based on history, our deposit beta is going to be 24% in the entire cycle versus where
we are. That's really what's driving that. We've picked up a lot of asset sensitivity from here. The question really is
going to be difficult to answer for anybody is, what is deposit beta going to do over the next 12 months? The best
thing that we can model is our history. And that's the reason that that asset sensitivity comes down, and then we'll
see how everybody performs over the next year or so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. And I also remind you, Stephen, that is a static balance sheet model. So, it has no changes in the mix or
anything like that. So, it's ...

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Great. Good reminder, Will. Thank you. And then last question, I guess for me is just things have been trending
phenomenally well for you guys, I think, the last couple of years, really, obviously but for a longer period of time
as well. But the stock has outperformed significantly year-to-date. How does that make you all think about the
M&A environment, given the value of your currency, especially coupled with the rate environment marks, et
cetera? How should we think about the likelihood of you guys dipping your toe back into the M&A game?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
It feels like the M&A environment is going to be a little slow for the next few quarters, Stephen, just with PE
valuations where they are, uncertainty around inflation and a recession. So, I think we've got a little more work to
do internally to continue to refine our processes and our technology. So, M&A in the short term is not a high
priority.

please go ahead. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Bishop Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Yeah. Good morning. Yeah. Sticking with the [indiscernible] (35:22), Steve, but I appreciate all the guidance
there. As it pertains to the balance sheet, just curious, exiting the quarter, your view of excess cash. I'm just
curious maybe what you view as a floor for that. Does it get back to the pre-pandemic level of about $1.2 billion,
just maybe your view of sort of excess cash and liquidity at this standpoint? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Hey, David. It's a good question. This is Steve. Yeah. That's right, around 2.5% of assets, give or take, it's
probably sort of the floor for cash. As you know, we have very little in the way of wholesale, have drawn any of
that down, so I think our brokered CDs are about $150 million or so that we did during the pandemic. We did long-
term CDs. We have no Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing. So, we have quite a few levers relative to the
flexibility within our balance sheet to raise cash.
But yeah, I think that's a good way to think about the modeling. And that if you kind of run that out, that's probably
an 80% loan-to-deposit ratio at the end of 2023 and roughly around 2.5%, 3% of assets in the cash if we do what
we just spoke about.

David J. Bishop Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Got it. And one follow-up in terms of the loan loss provisions this quarter. Just curious how much of that was sort
of deterioration and maybe the model-driven inputs? Was that factoring higher unemployment rate outlook? Just
curious maybe what sort of drove that elevated provision and what we should think about that moving into 2023.
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah, David. That's exactly right. In our – and of course, as you know, with CECL, you have lost drivers that are
selected based on statistical correlation with prior loss events, and in our case dates back to 2000 – the year
2000 for every bank that makes up SouthState, with the exception of failed banks. And as we've looked at
Moody's forecasts each quarter, we do a pretty thorough analysis of not only the output they have in these various
economic things, but the underlying assumptions behind them. And from that, we make a judgment about whether
we believe Moody's is right on the money or maybe a little too optimistic or pessimistic.
For several quarters now, we have viewed Moody's as being more optimistic. And Moody's base - [indiscernible]
(37:47) baseline, and their baseline is pretty similar to consensus. And so, we have been waiting more
pessimistically. We did find Moody's did move more pessimistically between Q2 and Q3, which did drive some of
those loss drivers to be more indicative of higher losses. We continue to be weighed down the recession there
which is S3 and for a decent portion of our allowance. So, yeah, the loss driver was [indiscernible] (38:21) based
on that. You saw, in the quarter, we had net recoveries in the quarter and generally pretty consistent asset quality
metrics. So, really the loss drivers from – or the economic forecasts from Moody's will drove our provision
expense this quarter.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2022
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
One follow-up on the margin. We spent a lot of time talking about the deposit betas, but just wanted to get your
thoughts, Steve, on loan yields. You saw nice increase in your loan yields this quarter. What are you thinking
about for where new loans are coming on? And then, what ultimately loan betas maybe over the cycle as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Thanks, Catherine. Pretty much the same. We have a slide in our deck that speaks to, I think it's page 19, which
speaks to the loan repricing frequency and what that basically says is about 30% of our loan portfolio reprices on
a kind of daily basis. Whenever they raise rates, it goes up. And then we also have another 11% that reprices that
are adjustable that will reprice in the next year. So, total 41% of the portfolio will reprice in the next 12 months. So,
that's probably a good indication of sort of how we think about beta. On the short end, it's roughly 30% on that.
And then, over time, as you produce more and as those adjustments come in the adjustable rate book, there's
another 11% that we'll reprice.
As it relates to loan yield, obviously, we had a big shock in interest rates in the third quarter. And so, our loan yield
continued to move up, and I think by the end of the quarter was over 5% for new production. Of course, some of
that is floating, and then as they raise rates, it'll be over 6% just because it's floating. But anyway, hopefully that's
a good characterization of how we're thinking about loan betas from here.

William E. Matthews A

That's helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
...we benefit from a lag effect on the pricing side, there's a little bit of lag effect on the loan side, too, as the market
and lenders acclimate to the rising rates, particularly ones moving as fast as these have, and you have
commitments out there that take a little bit to close. So, there's a lag effect on both sides.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Okay. And do you have the rate at which loan – where loan yields were maybe for the month of
September?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. Catherine, I don't know exactly right in front of me, but it was just north of 5%. I don't have the number, but
it was just north of 5% for the month of September.

Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Okay. That's helpful. That's great. And then, wanted to just on the reserve. I noticed that your reserve for
unfunded commitment increased a little bit more this quarter. Do have any commentary on what drove that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Catherine, we did have some growth in our unfunded commitments in the quarter and just sort of how the math
worked out. When we think about the reserve in our allowance committee, we do sort of think about it as a whole
for the 131 basis point number versus 113 basis point number. And it'll fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. The
fluctuation in the portion that goes in the reserve for unfunded, i.e., the liability versus the allowance for credit
losses, the contract asset. It does swing quarter to quarter. But I kind of think of it in terms of the combination of
the two.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.

Hey, thanks very much. Will and John, I know you gave a lot of details on the reserve and prior questions. I
noticed that the CECL reserve for the unfunded commitments went up a pretty good amount this quarter and that
the unfunded commitments themselves grew a lot from June to September. Just want to get a little more
background on that. Is that unusual or is more of that sort of line growth possible in the future?

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 25-Oct-2022
Yeah. I don't think it's unusual, Chris, and dovetailing in with the question Catherine just asked, that drove – that
was some of the reasons for the growth in the total reserve being more towards unfunded commitments. But in
terms of our, I don't know [indiscernible] (43:37) go ahead, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah. I mean, other than just to say that the unfunded commitments really HELOCs and C&Is have been
relatively flat. We have not yet returned to the funding levels we had pre-pandemic. We're about 5% to 10% under
the funding we had before the pandemic.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah.
HELOCs It gives our clients the flexibility going into if there's a recession.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. It's interesting, Chris, as we see with some of our other releases, we are trying to see higher line utilization.
I'm sure we will at some point, but thus far, we're still below pre-pandemic levels across – pretty much across the
board.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. I'm just looking at the $9.9 billion that's up from the $8.2 billion from June to September so if I somehow
miss that, that's fine. And I guess my follow-up question just relates to kind of what you're seeing from your clients
on the fixed income side as it pertains to kind of their use of wholesale funds? Do you expect them to be net
borrowers, and does that possibly spill over in additional business? I know the guide that Steve gave earlier which
is very helpful, just kind of want to get more context in terms of their behavior changes that might be happening?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. Chris, yeah, very, very interesting move. To your point, there was a lot of liquidity out of the system
probably nine months ago. And because of the loan growth and maybe the Fed doing quantitative tightening, that
liquidity has definitely come down for our correspondent bank clients. And we are seeing – as opposed to more
fixed income, we are seeing some borrowers from the brokerage market and system sales from our [indiscernible]
(45:16) there.
But most of our clients, and I'll speak to the community bank clients, typically have lower loan-to-deposit ratios
and have really good funding bases. And so, most of them probably are much bigger users of fixed income
because they have access to liquidity and lower loan-to-deposit ratios than they are of buying brokered CD –
buying or issuing brokered CDs. But clearly, there's been an uptick on our debt, which I'm sure is true for
everybody just because certain clients are using it more than, call it, a year ago.
