President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Thanks Kathryn and good morning, everyone. Synchrony delivered strong results during the second quarter
reflecting the power of our technology enabled model, the durability of our partner-centric value proposition and
the early indications of a consumer resurgence. With now more than a year of the COVID-19 pandemic moving
into the rearview mirror, I am proud of how our team has continued to execute on our strategic priorities. Our
multiproduct, multi-capability strategy has enabled us to nimbly adapt and deliver best-in-class products and
services to address our partners' evolving needs while also generating appropriate risk-adjusted returns for all our
stakeholders.
Let's get things started by reviewing some of the key financial highlights from the quarter, net earnings reached a
record $1.2 billion or $2.12 per diluted share. This reflected an increase of $2.06 over last year, as we marked the
anniversary of the pandemic's initial impact on our business and, really, the world. We are deeply grateful for all of
the frontline workers, scientists and leaders have done to support our community and make progress toward an
eventual return to normalcy.
Purchase volume grew 35% over last year, reflecting a 33% increase in purchase volume per account. This
increased spend was broad-based across our five business platforms. This strength in purchase volume was
largely offset by the persistently elevated payment rate trends resulting from the government stimulus and
industry-wide forbearance actions, leading to a slight increase in loan receivables which were $78.4 billion for the
second quarter.
Average balances per account were down about 4% for the period while new accounts were up about 58%. Net
interest margin of 13.78% was 25 basis points higher than last year. Elevated payment rates and excess liquidity
levels continue to have an impact on receivables and yield. The efficiency ratio was 39.6% for the quarter,
primarily reflecting lower net interest income. Expenses were down about 4% compared to last year and down 5%
year-to-date as our cost efficiency initiatives continue as planned.
We remain on track to remove about $210 million from our expense base by year end even as we continue to
invest in our business. Credit continued to perform very well. Net charge-offs were 3.57% for the second quarter,
down almost 178 basis points from last year.
Turning to our balance sheet, deposits were down $4 billion or 7% versus last year, reflecting retail deposit rate
actions we took to manage our excess liquidity position. Deposits represented 81% of our funding mix at quarter
end, a slight increase versus last year due to the retirement of some of our debt during the second quarter of
2021.
During the quarter, we returned $521 million in capital through share repurchases of $393 million and $128 million
in common stock dividends. We also continue to reinvest in our business. One of our greatest competitive

differentiators remains our digital capabilities. We continue to invest in innovative products and services that
enable our partners to meet their customers wherever and however they want to be met.
That where and how, of course, can change fairly quickly as can the objectives that our partners seek to achieve,
so we need to stay nimble and ahead of the curve. We have continued to win and renew key partnerships
including our recent renewal with TJX Companies. This has been a very valuable partnership for over 10 years
now and we are excited to continue to provide innovative financing products to TJX customers. We also renewed
10 other programs during the quarter including Shop HQ, Daniels and Sutherlands, and added four new programs
including JCB and Ochsner Health.
Our go-to-market strategy utilizes innovative and scalable ways to reach and serve customers effectively across a
broad spectrum of industries and financing needs and over the course of their lifecycle. We have built a
technology platform that harnesses our proprietary data analytics, cutting edge digital capabilities to offer a
customized suite of products specifically designed with our partners and their customers in mind, all while
delivering appropriately aligned economic outcomes.
Our recent business reorganization, which included the creation of a growth organization and the redistribution of
our partners from three sales platforms into five, will allow us to better leverage these company resources and
deliver swifter, more optimized products and capabilities for our partners and sustainable profitable growth for our
business. In fact, the growth we expect to achieve within each platform will be driven by utilizing our suite of
products to expand lifetime value, deploying more of our digital capabilities to expand customer reach, or adapting
our value propositions to harness organic trends as the landscape evolves. In the case of our home and auto
platform, a combination of all three.
In particular, our home partnerships have been a focus of Synchrony's going back to our business inception when
we started providing financing for appliance purchases. Over the years, we've significantly broadened the scope
of this platform and expanded our customer reach. Today, Synchrony has penetrated across all distribution points
in each sector of the home market. From big retailers to independent merchants and contractors and OEMs and
dealers, our home platform provides financing solutions to about 60,000 merchants and locations across a broad
spectrum of industries, including furniture and accessories, mattresses and bedding, appliances, windows,
roofing, HVAC and flooring.
Our partnerships are deeply rooted in industry expertise, data-driven strategic objectives and mutually beneficial
economic outcomes. The average length of our top 20 partners is over 30 years because we are able to deliver a
breadth of financing products, innovative digital capabilities and seamless customer experiences that are
customized to each partner's needs as they evolve over time.
Our data insights and analytics expertise, when combined with the partners own data, empowers each merchant
as they seek to optimize their marketing, customer acquisition and sales strategies. And the value that our suite of
products provides to their customers is clear. About 58% of our sales are repeat purchases. Whether customers
are looking to upgrade their living room couch or suddenly find themselves in need of a new washing machine, we
enable our partners to consistently support those needs through a variety of financing options that are best suited
to the customer and the particular purchase they're considering.
So whether we've been entrusted to enhance customer loyalty, drive transaction volume or [ph] usher a (09:14)
retailers' adoption of digital assets, our strategy has enabled steady growth across the home market. For the four
years prior to the pandemic, Synchrony's home receivables grew at a 7% CAGR as consumer spend within home

improvement, furniture and decor and electronic and appliances sectors each grew by between 4% and 8%
annually.
Certainly the pandemic has brought with it both challenges and opportunities. As consumers quarantined in their
homes, the desire to renovate their homes or upgrade their furniture and decor intensified. As people start to
leave crowded metropolitan communities for suburban neighborhoods, home improvement spend increased. In
2020 alone, the home industry represented an approximate $600 billion market opportunity. Synchrony serves a
fraction of that today.
Even as we normalize toward a pre-pandemic cadence, the consumers desire to invest in their living space is as
strong as ever perhaps reflecting a secular shift in favor of more remote work. We have positioned our home
platform very well to capitalize on these trends. We have opportunities to deepen the scope and reach of existing
partnerships while also implementing a number of strategic initiatives to better leverage our core competencies
and deepen our market penetration. For example, we have begun using more data and advanced analytics to
enhance our acquisition marketing and drive higher repeat sales.
We've also launched our direct-to-device capability which puts the simplicity of our financing application and the
power of our underwriting in the hands of the contractors and customers as they seek to install a new HVAC
system, replace their windows or repair an oven. This direct-to-device technology is also being deployed in
retailer locations which helps shorten checkout lines and delivers a completely digital solution to apply and buy
when in store.
In short, we are excited about the opportunities for growth that we see in our home platform. There are certainly
some natural tailwinds in the industry that should feel home spend even as life normalizes in a post-pandemic
world. We are actually more excited about the ways in which we're leveraging our technological innovations to
extend our customer reach, enhance the value of the products and services we offer and deepen our competitive
differentiation.
As we continue to execute on our long-term strategy, we are driving even greater customer lifetime value for our
partners, better experiences for their customers and strong returns for our stakeholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Thanks Brian and good morning, everyone. As Brian mentioned earlier, the strong results we achieved during the
second quarter reflected a number of factors. First, healthy consumer with significant savings and pent-up
demand to spending leading to broad-based purchase volume growth. Second, continued strength in credit
quality across our portfolio, we continue to closely monitor our portfolio as industry-wide forbearance begins to
expire across the broader consumer finance landscape and for some customers as rental forbearance also
expires.
Finally, the strong positioning of our business, combined with consistent execution by our team while we maintain
focus on efficient delivery of customized financing solutions and digitally enabled customer experiences across
our diverse portfolio partners, merchants and providers. Focusing on the healthy consumer who has robust
savings and desire to spend in an environment with improving economic trends.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
During the second quarter, consumer savings rates remained strong, unemployment continued to improve and
consumer confidence reached a 16 month high. As a result, discretionary spend seems to be making gradual
return to pre-pandemic levels, in fact a Conference Board survey from June indicated that there is also healthy
interest among consumers to spend on long-lasting manufactured goods over the next six months, including
homes, cars and major household appliances which we expect to be a positive tailwind for our home and auto
platform in particular.
Across our diverse set of platforms, strong consumer spend trends contributed to 35% higher purchase volume
compared to last year, primarily reflecting 33% stronger purchase volume per account. When comparing these
trends to the more normalized operating environment of the second quarter 2019 and excluding the impact of
Walmart, purchase volume was 18% higher in the second quarter 2021 and purchase volume per account was
22% higher. This demonstrates strong consumer demand translating the higher spend relative to pre-pandemic
levels.
Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 39% of the purchase volume in the second quarter and increased 56%
from last year. On a loan receivables basis, they accounted for 23% of the portfolio and were flat to the prior year.
Average active accounts were up about 2% compared to last year and new accounts were 58% higher totaling
more than 6 million new accounts in the second quarter. And over 11 million new accounts year-to-date.
Loan receivables reached $78.4 billion in the second quarter, a slight increase year-over-year as the period's
strong purchase volume growth was largely offset by persistently elevated payment rate. This marks the first
quarter of the year-over-year growth since the start of the pandemic. Payment rate was almost 300 basis points
higher when compared to last year which primarily led to a 6% reduction in interest and fees on loans.
RSA has increased $233 million or 30% from last year and were 5.25% of average receivables. The increase
relative to last year's second quarter was primarily reflected in the significant improvement in net charge-offs.
As a reminder, our retailer share arrangements are designed to share in program's performance and when the
portfolios are performing better on a risk-adjusted basis, our partner share in this performance. So the RSA is
performing as it is designed and the elevated levels we've seen over the last few quarters are reflection of
Synchrony's particular financial strength through the pandemic.
We continue to expect RSAs to decline as net charge-offs begin to rise. With an improved credit performance and
a more optimistic macroeconomic environment, we reduced our loan loss reserves by $878 million this quarter.
Other income decreased $6 million, generally reflecting higher loyalty program costs from higher purchase
volume during the quarter.
Other expense decreased $38 million due to lower operational losses partially offset by an increase in employee,
marketing and business development and information processing costs. Moving to slide 8 and our platform
results. We saw a broad-based purchase volume growth across all five platforms as consumers have become
increasingly confident and remaining local restrictions are being lifted. Both our health and wellness and
diversified value platforms experienced more than 50% growth in purchase volume. In health and wellness, this
primarily reflected lifting of local restrictions on in-person interactions and consumers being more comfortable with
the environment and undergoing elective procedures.
The lifting of state restrictions was also a primary driver of the significant purchase volume growth in our
diversified value platform as consumers increased their discretionary spend in categories like clothing and

assorted household goods. Meanwhile purchase volume grew by 30% in our digital platform, 25% in home and
auto and 9% in lifestyle.
Loan receivable growth trends by platform generally reflected stabilization or modest growth versus the prior year
as the higher purchase volume was partially offset by the elevated payment rates. The one exception being our
diversified value platform which was also impacted by store closures in 2020.
Average active account trends were mixed on a platform basis, up by as much as 5% in digital and down by as
much as 6% in health and wellness. The active account growth in digital generally reflected the combination of a
shift in the timing of an annual promotional events and the ramp up of some of our recent partner launches. The
active account decline in health and wellness was primarily associated with the continued strength in consumer
balance sheets.
Interest and fees were generally down across the platforms with the exception of lifestyle due to lower yield as a
result of elevated payment trends we've been discussing. I'll move to slide 9 to discuss net interest income and
margin trends. During the quarter, the continued combined impacts of the market stimulus and high savings
balance built during the pandemic led to higher than the average payment rate across our portfolio.
As slide 9 shows, payment rate ran approximately 280 basis points higher than our five year historical average
and about 300 basis points higher relative to last year's second quarter. It's worth noting the gradual moderation
in payment rate from April to June at which point the payment rate was 18.5% and 90 basis point decrease for the
March monthly peak of 19.4%.
We expect continued gradual moderation in payment rate as consumers continue to spend the excess savings
they accumulated resulting from the combined impact of stimulus and slower discretionary spend during the
lockdown.
Interest and fees were down about 6% in the second quarter, reflecting lower financed charge yield from elevated
payment rate trends and continued lower delinquent accounts resulting from our strong credit performance. Net
interest income decreased 2% from last year. The net interest margin was 13.78% compared to last year's margin
of 13.53%, a 25 basis points year-over-year improvement driven by favorable interest-bearing liabilities cost and
mix of interest earning assets partially offset by the pandemic's impact on loan receivable yield.
More specifically, interest-bearing liabilities cost were 1.42%, a year-over-year improvement of 73 basis points
primarily due to lower benchmark rates. This provided 62 basis point increase in our net interest margin. The mix
of loan receivables as a percent of total earning assets increased by 170 basis points from 78% to 79.7% driven
by lower liquidity held during the quarter. This accounted for a 32 basis point increase in the margin.
The loan receivables yield was 18.62% during the second quarter, the 84 basis points year-over-year reduction
reflected the impact of higher payment rate and lower interest and fees which we discussed earlier and impacted
our net interest margin by 65 basis points.
We continue to believe that in the second half of the year, liquidity will continue to be deployed into asset growth
and slowing payment rates should result in a higher interest and fee yields leading to increasing net interest
margin.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on slide 10. In terms of specific dynamics for the quarter, I'll start with the
delinquency trends. Our 30 plus delinquency rate was 2.11% compared to 3.13% last year. Our 90 plus
delinquency rate was 1% compared to 1.77% last year.
Higher payment trends continue to drive delinquency improvements. Focusing on the net charge-off trends, our
net charge-off rate was 3.57% compared to 5.35% last year. Our reduction in net charge-off rate was primarily
driven by improving delinquency trends as customer behavior pattern improved over the last several quarters. Our
allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 11.51%. As far as our credit outlook is
concerned, we're monitoring trends in our portfolio closely as the accounts enrolls a multiple forbearance
programs roll-off, but have not seen any indication in our portfolio to-date.
Our best expectation at this time is that delinquencies should begin to rise sometime in the back half of 2021
leading to peak delinquencies in mid-2022. This would translate a net charge-off peak in late 2022. Moving to
slide 11, I'll cover expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses were down $38 million or 4% from last year to $948
million as we continue to execute on our strategic plan to reduce costs and remain disciplined in managing our
expense base. Specifically, the decrease was driven by lower operational losses, partially offset by increased
employee, marketing and business development and information processing costs.
The efficiency ratio for the second quarter was 39.6% compared to 36.3% last year. The main driver of the
increase of the efficiency ratio was a negative impact from lower revenue that resulted from a combination of
lower receivables and lower interest and fee yields. This is partially offset by a reduction in expenses.
Moving to slide 12. Given the reduction in our loan receivables in 2020 and early 2021 and the strength in our
deposit platform, we continue to carry a higher level of liquidity. While we believe it's prudent to maintain a higher
liquidity level during uncertain and volatile periods, we continue to actively manage our funding profile to mitigate
excess liquidity where appropriate.
As a result of this strategy, there was a shift in our mix of funding during the quarter. Our deposits declined $4.3
billion from last year. Our securitized and unsecured funding sources declined by $2.6 billion. This resulted in
deposits being 81% of our funding compared to 80% last year, with securitized funding comprising 10% and
unsecured funding comprising 9% of our funding sources at quarter end. Total liquidity, including undrawn credit
facilities, was $21.2 billion which equated to 23% of our total assets down from 29% last year.
Before I provide details on our capital position, it should be noted that we elected to take the benefit of the
transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies which had two primary benefits. First, it delays the
effect of the CECL transition adjustment for an incremental two years; and second, it allows for a portion of the
current period provisioning to be deferred and amortized with the transition adjustment.
With this framework, we ended the quarter at 17.8% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 250 basis points
above last year's level of 15.3%. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.7% under the CECL transition rules compared to
16.3% last year. The total capital ratio increased 250 basis points to 20.1%. And the Tier 1 capital plus reserves
ratio on a fully phased-in basis was 28% compared to 26.5% last year, reflecting the impact of the retained net
income.
During the quarter, we returned $521 million to shareholders, which included $393 million in share repurchases,
and paid a common stock dividend of $0.22 per share. During the quarter, we also announced the approval of a
$2.9 billion share repurchase program through June 2022 as well as our plans to maintain our regularly quarterly
dividend.

Our business generates a considerable amount of capital, thanks to the scalability of our digital capabilities, utility
of our diversified product suite, and the prioritization of growth at attractive risk adjusted returns. We will continue
to take an opportunistic approach to returning capital to shareholders as our business performance and market
conditions allow, subject to our capital plan and any regulatory restrictions.
As we exit the pandemic and the environment normalizes, we're confident in our capabilities and positioning of
our business. We are emerging from this period as a stronger and more dynamic company and we're excited

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first
question is from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW, please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks, good morning. So Brian Doubles, you mentioned an early indication of consumer resurgence, I'm just
curious which macro data points and micro ones give you the most encouragement? And then I guess, the
question I'm getting quite a bit is what the setup is for loan growth with us moving away from stimulus and there
being other benefits coming from the government like the tax credits and, obviously, infrastructure, maybe you
could just help us think through all of that. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, hey, Sanjay. So look, I think no matter where you look, we feel pretty bullish around what we're seeing in
the economy. Consumer confidence continues to build, the trends on retail sales and spending, all of that is
translating into really good spend on our card. So as we look across our five platforms, it really is broad-based.
35% purchase volume growth year-over-year, really strong across all five platforms. The fact that we were up
18% versus 2019, I think is a really good indication. So it's not just that we're comping against a weak 2020, it
really is broad-based growth across the company.
And then as you look at kind of per account purchase volume, per account was up 33%, so that's another positive
indicator. And then this is a little more anecdotal, but as we talked to our partners, no matter what segment we're
in, they're seeing a lot of pent-up demand to spend. The providers in CareCredit, they're booking appointments
now, three, four months out, they're opening the practices on Saturdays and Sundays to keep up with the volume.
So I know that's a little more anecdotal but as our teams are out every day, talking to the partners, they're in the
stores, they're just seeing and feeling a lot of pent-up demand to spend. And I don't know, Brian, if you want to
add to that a little bit on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, the only thing I would add, Sanjay, to that is, as we look at savings rates, you clearly see the consumer
who increased their savings in the beginning part of the pandemic when stimulus happened, that came back
down in line with historical averages towards the end of 2020. [ph] Egen (00:29:35) saw that lift here in the end of
the first quarter into the second quarter with the stimulus actions.
We begin – we see now across the 29 largest banks that beginning to trail down a little bit. So, some of those will
come back in line clearly with the spending behavior patterns as well as the increase in the financial obligations
as mortgage forbearance, auto forbearances and the enhanced unemployment benefits began to fade here in the
back half of the year.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
Yeah, I think Sanjay, you touched on receivables growth, that will absolutely come. We had four out of our five
platforms had receivables growth. The payment rate is a little bit tough to predict, but we don't see anything that is
permanent inside of the portfolio. So I do think we will see a reversion to the mean around payment rate. And
based on the spend that we're seeing on our cards, receivables growth will absolutely come and we're starting to
see some positive signs there in, like I said four out of our five platforms this quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, great. That's a perfect. And just a follow-up, there's a couple of portfolios that have been out there,
mentioned to be for RFP. I'm just curious how you are seeing your pipeline develop in terms of deal – portfolio
acquisition except from, maybe you could just touch on that. And just one clarification, Brian Wenzel, the
framework for key drivers from last quarter, I mean it sounds like most of them stand, but I just wanted to clarify
that they still stand? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, so let me start on the pipeline question, Sanjay. So I would say across all five platforms, we've got a good
pipeline of new opportunities. One of the benefits of the reorganization is our teams are getting even deeper and
aligned by industry. And we've got some fresh set of eyes on certain things and we're looking at opportunities for
new programs and start-ups, that are a little bit unconventional, a little bit creative and I think that's a great sign
and kind of part of what we are trying to achieve with the reorg.
I would tell you most of the opportunities that we're seeing in the pipeline are start-ups or new programs with a
couple exceptions of things that are out there that we're looking at that that have existing portfolios, but again
strong pipeline across all five platforms.

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Sanjay to your framework question, so the lack of the page I wouldn't confuse with the fact that we're
changing that framework again, I think when you look at what we put out in the first quarter, we highlighted the
continued high payment rates that will impact loan growth in the first half of the year, that's going to continue. We
do think it begins to abate in the back half of the year.
So I think from the purchase volume and receivable growth standpoint, it's the same. Clearly the elevated
payment rate and persistency of that will provide a little bit of headwind and net interest margin as we move into
the back half of the year.
From a credit perspective, the higher payment rate really has given us what I'd say almost pristine type credit. So
I think you'll see in the back half of the year and really for the full year for the company, we're going to be sub-4%
on a loss rate perspective which is remarkable for this business given the high margins.
And then the RSA, following those trends will be a little bit more elevated in the back half of the year, which again,
is working as it's designed to share in the upside performance of the company. So that's how I think about, it's
largely consistent with what we've said back in the first quarter so.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from John Hecht with Jefferies.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Good new customer activity, maybe can you tell us how
much of that was, say, from the new work channels like Venmo and Verizon. Maybe just give us kind of an update
on call it the maturation of those two new programs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah John, so we obviously can't break out any specific performance on the programs, but I can just talk
generally about both. Venmo is doing really well. We're in full launch mode. I would say performance is better
than our expectations so far. We are getting really great feedback from the customers around just the val prop
and the fact that we maximized rewards in those spend categories. They love the card design, they love the QR
code, the ability to split payments and share. And so that programs off to a great start. It's still early, but all of the
key indicators that we look at are performing really well.
And similarly on Verizon, this is another program for us that will be a top 10 program in the future. Performing
ahead of our expectations, I think great feedback on the val prop. It's definitely behaving like a top of wallet card
which is what we intended. That was the goal. And so we're seeing really good spend on Verizon products and
even – and outside as well. So, off to a great start on both and like I said I think these can both be top 10
programs for us in the future.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay, very good, thanks. And then Brian, I'm wondering just maybe if you could give us a high level kind of quick
discussion again on the state of the market and really what I'm kind of interested in is you've got some new kind
of emerging market participants in the buy now pay later product and so forth. And I'm kind of getting – wondering
what your sense is for kind of underwriting quality across the spectrum and kind of competitive factors across the
spectrum given the changing elements of the market?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah John, it's a great question I think. Obviously there are always new entrants in the buy now pay later space, I
think it's pretty clear at this point that every financial service provider out there will offer a buy now pay later

product. Equal pay financing is a big part of our business already. We highlighted, we do over $15 billion of
balances currently on equal pay products. We offer those products over 70,000 locations.
So our goal at the end of the day is to have a multi-product, multi-capability solution. I think ultimately that's what's
going to win. And that's what we're offering to our providers. In terms of the competitive dynamics, it's hard to tell
how others are underwriting. Like what I can tell you is we've been in this business a long time, it is really
important to stay disciplined which means you don't go a lot deeper in really good times and you try not to
contract too much in bad times, because we know that our partners really value that stability, the consistency of
our underwriting and they get used to a certain approval rate. And we try to protect that in both good times and
bad times.
And as we all know, if you've been in this business a long time, if you do take on substantially more risk and
you're winning business by lowering your underwriting standards and that's a losing strategy over the long-term.
And so that's not how we operate and we've got a very experienced, disciplined credit team. And look, we want to
win business based on our products and capabilities, based on our technology, our partnership model. We never
want to win business based on just going deeper and taking on more risk.

Operator: And we have our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yes. Brian, can you talk a little bit about the child tax credit, digging a little bit more, for example, do you think that
will lead to higher payment rates in July versus June. And how do you think about the overall materiality of it
versus prior stimulus?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Thanks, Don. Obviously an influx of $15 billion of cash on top of what's already out there is clearly not
going to be beneficial. That being said, being it's targeted to folks that earn less $150,000, that's a pull forward
really from 2022.
I'm not necessarily sure it will have a material impact necessarily on our payment rates. As we look in the
beginning part of July, we have not seen a real elevation of the payment rates are more consistent with what we
saw as we exited out of June. So I don't really see any data yet that says that that's going to be a potential

Hi good morning.

Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Hey, Betsy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Morning, Betsy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I've a couple questions just – the first one you talked through the NIM and the loan growth and how it's being
impacted by the payment rates et cetera, but could you speak to how much the loan growth and potentially NIM is
impacted by some of these new entrants that we've been seeing and discussing here, be it either BNPL or other
kinds of payment schemes that enable people to really shift some of their spending away from what might have
been their primary payment device. I'm just wondering if that's had any impact?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, Betsy, I'll let Brian chime in here. But what we're seeing is really attributed to the higher payment rate just
because consumers' balance sheets are stronger than they've ever been and I think that is the primary driver. I
don't think this is competitive pressure in any way. But I'll let Brian add some color to that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, I'll just point back to a couple of things, Betsy. First when you look at our new account origination, the 6.3
million new accounts, up 1% versus 2019, so we're not seeing and even when we look down at the providers that
may have alternative type of products at least buy now pay later products. We're not seeing a real impact relative
to new accounts.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
We also don't really see it in the payment rate where we're kind of going through, it really is as Brian pointed out
the accumulated savings rates that you've seen and stimulus that has flowed through the consumer that's really
driving the pressure against purchase volume and headwind on to net interest margin, which is producing
tremendous credit which we sometimes put in the back mirror. But the credit is really terrific right now. So we will
continue to monitor, but we don't see an impact from the alternative players.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great, okay. Now I got it. And clearly credit is a part of a mass here, so it's a little bit surprising when people only
look at like a PPOP instead of including the credit in there, I agree. I guess the other question I have on this is,
with regard to deposit products that you might be planning or thinking of offering, because when you think about
the BNPL, the pay in 4, the pure pay in 4. I know there is different BNPLs, but the pure pay in 4 should be
financed or funded with a checking account, right.
I mean you shouldn't be paying for your pay in 4 with a card balance. But I just wanted to understand how you're
thinking about that when you're developing your own products. And whether or not we should be anticipating
more in the way of deposit products coming out from you? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, no, I mean Betsy, it's a great question. And we agree, you shouldn't pay out one credit product with another
credit product, so we agree with that. I think we're looking at some alternative kind of savings products as part of
our broader product strategy. Buy now pay later is obviously top of mind right now across I think all issuers. Like I
said I think everybody will have a version of it. We have $15 billion of balances today as I said and we're rolling
out some new capabilities and features in the second half of the year. So nothing I can get too specific at this
point, but more to comment definitely part of our multiproduct strategy that I touched on earlier.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
Hey everybody, thanks for taking my questions this morning. Brian, you did a great job highlighting the impact of
home and auto on the portfolio. I'm curious with the changes in the composition over the last several years. How
important you think back-to-school is particularly in light of the challenges for back-to-school spending last year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, back-to-school hasn't been a big driver for us for a number of years, Rick, which is kind of surprising. We
just – we don't see a ton of volume there and I think it's not as much of an event as it was probably an event you
and I were growing up, it was more of an event I know even for my girls, they don't – there isn't a back-to-school
event where they all go get new clothes and stuff for school. So we tend to see that spend space out over a
longer period of time and it's less of a spike for us. So I think that trend will continue even in the new paradigm.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Operator: And we have our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great, thanks. Brian, I'm hoping that you could kind of talk a little bit about the kinds of conversations that you
have with your large retail partners about BNPL. In other words, I have to believe that they are quite invested in
the success of your programs given they earned a significant amount of money whereas on BNPL, they're kind of
paying a significant amount of money. And so kind of – maybe could you just – obviously, not asking about any
specific partner, but what are those conversations like?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, it's a great question, Moshe. I think a lot of our partners are still in kind of the evaluation phase where they
look at the buy now, pay later product and they obviously see a customer desire for that product right, and a
customer demand for it. But one of the big questions is as you pointed out, it's around economics. And it's still
early there. And I think some retailers are willing to pay what is a pretty steep merchant discount rate if they
believe that they are attracting new customers and they're getting sales that they wouldn't otherwise get.
But when they look at that comparison, they look at compared to some of our products where not only do we not
charge interchange, we're also paying them quite a bit through the RSA. And they look at that and they say, okay,
clearly, economically they would prefer that the purchase goes on the private label card or co-brand card because
it's much better for them financially. And so to the extent that they stop believing that they're actually getting
incremental purchases or new customers, then the economic trade-off is very clear. And so, I do think down the
road, there's an economic reckoning that will happen as this plays out and it's still early in terms of these products
and how they're offered.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
The other thing I would mention is that the other advantage and the things that we hear from our partners is they
like the lifetime relationship that a card provides, they can do lifecycle marketing, they can do promotions and
offers over number of years. And one of the things that we talk a lot about with our partners and one of the things
that we measure across all of our partners is repeat purchases. And we talked to you guys a lot about that as well
because that has been a big focus for us over the last five years.
And one of the things that, frankly, our partners look to us for is that ongoing customer loyalty. We measure that,
we look at it by customer, when was the last time, they made a purchase; okay, let's send them a customized
offer or promotion. So, they really like that ability to do that lifecycle marketing. So I think it's a combination of
economics and that's still kind of a TBD and how all this is going to shake out. But the other thing that we hear
across the board is they want to have a long-term relationship with the customer. They really value the loyalty that
a lot of our products provide.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Thank you. And my follow-up question for Brian Wenzel. I mean you kind of highlighted the impact of late fees
along with the payment rate, could you just talk a little bit about how that comes back like what is the timeframe?
Is it kind of early stage delinquencies? How should we think about that normalization of that factor?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, great question, Moshe. I think the way we kind of think about credit outlook now, delinquencies build
towards latter part of this year heading into 2022. So late fees will begin to come back as you see the entry rate in
delinquency begin to rise, so that will come first before you get into the charge-off. So if you believe that, the latter
part of this year, you'll begin to see the yield impact benefit coming from higher late fees in the portfolio.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark C. DeVries Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yeah, thanks. I had the question about the NIM. Can you help us think about the lift that you may get from both
the normalization of the payment rate to kind of the long-term historic average and also maybe the normalization
of liquidity as a percentage of assets?

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2021
Yeah. So the way I would think about, let's take liquidity first in the portfolio, so clearly we've been able to burn off
some of that liquidity here in the second quarter both through the $2 billion in asset growth that we had as well as
the acceleration of some of the maturities in the funding profile. So, we're running over $2 billion continued excess
liquidity as we enter into the back half of the year.
If you take out all the excess liquidity from here, there's probably another 40 basis points out to the net interest
margin that you'd see a lift from. Again, we've highlighted before, you probably have 20 to 30 basis points from
benchmark rates, so put that off to the side. The residual comes in probably two fashions: one is late fees which –
you're probably – 80 to 90 basis points of lift going back to a normalized late fee load, so not even at a [ph] loss
rate (00:49:35) higher than 5.5%, but your normal load. And then you have the residual which will be the revolve
when [ph] payment (00:49:42) rates come back in line.
So, the one thing I'd say is we do not see anything in the portfolio today that gives us any indication that the net
interest margin in that 16% realm is not going to be the mean that we go back to, and we'll be continue to watch it.
But there's nothing fundamentally or structurally that we think is different, it's just really the timing to get there,
given the excess liquidities that the consumer has and that they're going to deploy here in the short term.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark C. DeVries Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up question on – Brian, on your comments about your partners
really wanting to kind of stimulate the longer lifecycle with customers, do they find that using the revolving product
where they've got incentives on spend is the best way to do that as opposed to offering some type of or maybe a
lower rate, kind of fixed loan product on balances?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, Mark. I mean, it really does vary by partner, but I would say the majority, particularly the larger partners,
they see the value of the value prop, right, the rewards, the loyalty that that drives. When they go into one of our
large partners and a lot of times they're saving 5%, that is really meaningful. We do that at Amazon, we do at
Lowe's, we do at number of places now. And that's a great way to incent that repeat purchases.
I think the other thing that we've been doing for a number of years now is and most of partners we store the card
as the default payment type, right. And so you don't even have to think about it. It just goes right on the card, you
get your 5% and that's something that our partners have been very focused on as well to drive that, again, the
lifetime relationship with the cardholder and the loyalty that comes with it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark C. DeVries Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. And I assume they also get the fastest checkout using the revolving products, correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, I mean it's just incent, right, it's stored as – I know for Amazon, for me, it's stored as my default, I get my
5%, I don't even think about it, it just automatically goes on the card. So it's certainly the easiest, fastest way to
check out for most of our partners.

Hi, this is Nate Richam [ph] online (00:52:14) for Mihir Bhatia. Thanks for taking my question. I'm curious about
how program costs are trending, and I know you don't typically comment on specific portfolios. [ph] But are your
(00:52:25) rewards for consumers increasing for [ph] newer (00:52:24) portfolios like, for instance, I've noticed
what prominent rewards [ph] promotions (00:52:28) for Venmo. I'm just curious that's additive or representative
with a broader portfolio and trying to get new customers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathaniel Richam-odoi Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Right, is that increasing for the newer portfolios like I've seen Venmo had like more promotions and rewards, I'm
wondering if that's additive or representative with broader portfolio for new customer acquisitions?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, the way I would think about the loyalty cost, first, our volume is up significantly year-over-year and up
versus 2019, so you're going to see a general trend in loyalty cost higher. More certainly the new programs of
Verizon and Venmo will have those costs that are in there. It probably – slightly higher percent of the asset
because the assets just beginning to build, but it's not significantly different than our overall portfolio, not
necessarily the drivers really the increase purchase volume across the entire portfolio that's driving our value prop
and loyalty costs.

Dominick Gabriele Q
Director & Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Hey, thanks so much for taking my questions. Can you – we obviously have the new segments that you've broken
out the new platforms. Can you talk about the differences in each of the platforms that have made you decide to
break them up this way and as far as the marketing teams, the go-to-market strategy and if they are actually
running a software that's different among them? Thanks so much, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, sure so the reason to reorganize and align more by industry was a couple fold. First, in terms of – to your
point, the products and capabilities that we offer tend to align better by industry and even more important than
that how we integrate in the products and capabilities and how we integrate them into the digital environment or
the store footprint, tends to align as well by industry. So, one example, for our purely digital players, PayPal,
Venmo, Amazon, were integrating through our API technology or through SyPI technology right inside of their
app. And that's a different than what we would do in home and auto where for some of our larger partners were
integrating both in their digital environment, mobile, online, but we also have tools and technologies to apply and
buy in-store.
And so, because of the product suite tends to be catered more towards the industry because of the types of
products that they're selling as well as whether or not they are purely digital or have a store footprint, it just made
more sense to align by industry. I'd say the second piece of this and we saw this in CareCredit over the last 30
years. It really is an advantage to get really deep domain expertise in an industry. And one of the things that I
think has been a secret to our success in CareCredit is that domain expertise, our teams get – they build lifetime
relationships, they get really deep in the different domains that we support dental that et cetera. And we're trying
to replicate that in these other platforms.
So those were the two primary reasons. I can tell you it's been great just a couple of months in having these
teams in place, looking at these segments differently, it's seeing kind of natural synergies and ideas for new
products and capabilities, as we're out talking to partners and thinking about it more within industry than to it. So
far the progress has been really great.

Dominick Gabriele Q

Great. Thank you for that detail. And then this might be a longshot, but can you talk about the tender share by
each of those and if not specific numbers because I know that's unlikely maybe just perhaps which one of the
segments is at the average tender share below and above average of the whole company. And then when we
think about the RSA in the second quarter, is that the high watermark if you think about NCL rate stay roughly –
fairly in line with where they are for the rest of this year, is that the high watermark on a percentage basis for the
RSA? Thank you very much, I really appreciate it, guys.

Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, let me start on the kind of the penetration question. I would say across each of those platforms, we've got
significant room to grow penetration. Inside of each of those platforms we have – we have start-up programs
where were relatively small percentage of the payments inside of those programs and we have very mature
programs where we can be 30%, 40% pen.
What I can tell you is we measure our teams on increasing that penetration rate regardless of where they are at.
So, even for the more mature programs, our teams that are embedded inside of our partners, they get measured
based on growth and driving that incremental tender share. So even in our mature programs, we are very focused
on that – the penetration rate. I don't know Brian if you want to take the second piece of that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, so RSA, as you think about RSA in the back half, the two factors really to focus on is, one the purchase
volume, right, because as RSA is not only sharing, there is volume oriented purchases. So the strength in
purchases you see in the back half of the year and then how the net charge-off and provision line continues to
develop. I mentioned earlier in the call, we expect the NCL rate for the full year to be below 4%, but if there are
incremental ACL releases, that could impact it. So, we'll remain elevated in the back half of the year from where
we are historically. But it should be dramatically larger than what we saw in the second quarter.

Operator: And thank you. Our last question is from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Good morning. As you look to further out, do you see the normalization of the payment rates providing a tailwind
to the normalization of your revolve rates, such that we can see a loan growth starts to outpace your spending
growth, if you could speak to that dynamic?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, clearly we've said that we believe payment rate will move back to the mean, that will accelerate loan growth
and more certainly if you had a slowing purchase volume market, that could push the loan growth ahead of the

purchase volume growth. Again the way we've thought about the back half of the year and it hasn't really changed
– in the back half heading into 2022 that you are going to continue to see elevated purchase volume, one from
pent-up demand that we see and as we talk to our partners, merchants and providers that you're going to see the
consumer who has the wherewithal with the savings to continue to spend.
So I think over the next 18 months, you're going to continue to see elevated purchase volume, Bill, and then
you're going to combine that with a moderation of the payment rate to the mean over time, so the two will work in
concert.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Got it. And then separately on capital, there has been some skepticism around your ability to get on to pure levels
of capital. Can you speak to what gives you confidence that you can get there? And I might have missed this, but
any commentary on the potential for increasing the authorization above your current plan?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, Bill, I'm going to first point you back to a little bit of the history right. As we separated from GE, we had an
18% capital level, we had worked that down to 14% over a couple of years, three, four years. So we've
demonstrated the ability, we've demonstrated the ability just before the pandemic to take that capital I think $3.3
billion in the nine month period before the pandemic happened. So, I think we have the ability – and demonstrated
capability to do that.
So I think we're confident in our ability to get down there now. With regard to the current authorization right, we
talked about this a little bit in the first quarter, that is a backwards looking authorization, right. So the data which
we used through on our stress scenarios, under our processes and governance mechanisms were based off of
December and early January assumptions, right. So that's where we had the capital plan put together and
approved by our board.
If things continue to change, we'll evaluate whether or not there is a desire for the broad leadership team to
increase that authorization level and we'll revisit that, but right now we have $2.5 billion remaining. We've
executed $593 million so far this year which were slightly regulated by the restrictions put on by the fed. And we
will be aggressive with regard to our execution against the $2.5 billion and again if the environment warrants, we'll
revisit that.
