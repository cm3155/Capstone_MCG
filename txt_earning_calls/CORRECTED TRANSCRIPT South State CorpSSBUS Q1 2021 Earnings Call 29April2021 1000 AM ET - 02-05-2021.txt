Q1 2021 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2021
Robert R. Hill Jr.
Executive Chairman, South State Corp.
Thank you, Will, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today.
The SouthState team continues to make excellent progress in many areas and we are excited for the road ahead.
2021 will be the year where many significant events come together for SouthState. The integration is on track.
Vaccination speed and reopening of our markets are happening rapidly. And the differentiation for what we bring
to the market continues to grow. 2021 is a year that sets us up well to focus on the future for our team, our
customers and our shareholders. Do challenges exist? Certainly, they do. But our team is focused in tackling
these challenges very strategically and thoughtfully.
I'll now turn the call over to John for more insight into the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Good morning. I hope you and your families are doing well and staying healthy.
Each and every quarter over the past year, the economic backdrop changed considerably. With record levels of
fiscal and monetary stimulus and a successful vaccine program, it appears clear that the banking industry dodged
a bullet and will avoid a prolonged credit cycle. The industry and SouthState in particular are equipped with
enormous amounts of liquidity, capital and loan loss reserves. Our balance sheet has never been stronger.
Given these positive developments and four consecutive quarters with net charge-offs of either zero or 1 basis
point, we released $58 million in loan loss reserves, leaving us with ample reserves remaining of 1.8%. The
reserve release, coupled with another strong quarter in mortgage and correspondent banking and stable net
interest income, produced earnings per share of $2.06. Adjusting for merger expenses, earnings per share came
in at $2.17, resulting in a return on assets of 1.6% and a return on tangible common equity of 22%.
With over 1 million deposit account holders and the additional government stimulus, our core deposits surged by
30% in the quarter and our deposit cost fell to just 15 basis points. The result of the deposit surge is that we
currently have over $5 billion in excess cash to deploy. On a positive note, commercial and industrial loan
balances increased for the third consecutive quarter. But overall loan balances declined as the bulk of our
residential loan production was directed to the secondary market.
After a year and a half of dreaming, planning and working, the integration of CenterState and SouthState is
almost complete. Several of the departments and lines of business have already merged together and the main
system conversion will occur next month. The short-term tangible goal of the merger was to become more
efficient in a revenue challenged environment. But the longer term and the more important strategic goal was to
create a new Southeast regional bank that could successfully compete head-to-head with the largest banks in the
south, who control about two-thirds of the market share. By combining CenterState and SouthState, we've
created a $40 billion regional bank in the most desirable markets in the country.
In 2020, the pandemic allowed families the freedom to choose where they wanted to live and work, and
population in-migration accelerated in the Southeast. Of the 10 cities in the United States with the most in-
migration, 5 of the top 10 cities are core markets for SouthState. Both Orlando and Tampa on the I-4 corridor in
Florida, and then Atlanta, Greenville and Charlotte on the I-85 corridor.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2021
As further evidence that SouthState is becoming the preferred alternative to the national banks, we announced
last week the addition of 10 new commercial and middle-market bankers that were recruited from the large banks
during the quarter. This follows recruiting success in the fourth quarter as well. The quality of the bankers we are
attracting has never been better. Our competitors appreciate the strength of SouthState's balance sheet, our new
technology and capital market solutions, and most importantly, the entrepreneurial culture that sets us apart.
Our strategy is working. As we emerge later this summer from the recession, the pandemic and our systems
conversion, SouthState is poised to generate significant growth and shareholder value in the years ahead.
I'll now turn it over to Will to walk you through the first quarter results.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Thanks, John. I'll cover some highlights on margin, noninterest income and noninterest expense, as well as credit
and the provision for credit losses. Let's begin by talking about NIM.
Net interest income for the quarter totaled $262 million and comparing with Q4 of 2020, remember that we had
two fewer days in Q1, costing us approximately $6 million. I'll also note that we continue to operate with a
significant cash in fed funds sold position, ending the quarter at almost $6 billion and averaging $5.1 billion versus
the Q4 2020 average balance of $4.8 billion. Our net interest margin was 3.12% for Q1, down 2 basis points from
Q4's 3.14%.
On a core basis, excluding accretion and the impact of PPP loans, our NIM of 2.85% was down 7 basis points
from Q4's 2.92%. If you normalized for the buildup in cash and fed funds sold in the quarter, our reported NIM
would've improved about 0.5 basis point versus Q4. We began to see rates on new loans improved in the first
quarter, with first quarter new production weighted average coupons up 4 basis points from Q4 to 3.41%. We
were still adding loans at rates below the portfolio yield, but the difference improved from the fourth quarter. Our
non-PPP loan balances declined to $185 million, a 3% annualized rate in the quarter, with the decline
concentrated in single-family residential loans and HELOCs down $130 million.
Slide 18 in our presentation shows what we've done with our residential mortgage loan book in the last year. As
gain on sale margins expanded and long-term rates on mortgage loans declined, our portfolio of adjustable rate
loans shrank, but our servicing book increased. Our total residential mortgage loans under management
increased from $8.6 billion to $10 billion, or 16%, while our residential loans on balance sheet declined by $600
million, and our servicing for others increased approximately $2 billion. As gain-on-sale margins and loan yields
change, ARM rates are likely to become more attractive to borrowers and this portfolio trend is likely to reverse.
Purchased credit deteriorated loans also declined by $242 million during the quarter. Our C&I loans grew by $28
million, offset by declines in consumer and construction, and CRE. With our commercial pipeline building back up
to approximately $4.2 billion at quarter end, we feel encouraged about growth improving in the back half of the
year.
On the deposit side, we continued to show incremental reduction in the cost of deposits, down 2 basis points to
15 basis points for Q1, and our total cost of funds improved by 5 basis points. Deposit inflows continued to be
significant, growing $1.7 billion in the quarter, benefited by the most recent round of PPP lending and stimulus
payments received by customers.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2021
With the continuation of record levels of on-hand liquidity and the yield curve steepening in the quarter, we took
the opportunity to invest a small portion of our cash in the investment portfolio, which grew by approximately $820
million versus year-end. We were careful not to deploy much cash into investments when we were at rate
bottoms, with much of our investments in the quarter coming in the month of February and March after rates
backed up.
As you can see on slide 13, investments moved up to 13% of assets, but were still below our fed funds sold
balances, which were at 14% of assets. We remain below peer in securities to assets and well above peer in cash
to assets, so we continue to have extensive dry powder, giving us some leverage to additional earnings through
deployment as well as to higher rates.
Turning to noninterest income. Our noninterest income of $96.3 million was down slightly from Q4's $97.8 million.
Mortgage banking income was up $1.7 million. As noted on slide 15, we produced $1.3 billion in the quarter and
we remain purchase-focused at 63% of our volume again this quarter. We did complete the integration on the one
common mortgage loan origination system in mid-January. As we'd expected, our pipeline also improved after the
loan origination system conversion, growing to $945 million this quarter, up from $674 million at year-end.
Turning to slide 16, correspondent income was up $1 million, with lower interest rate swap revenue in our capital
markets business offset by higher fixed income revenue. Fixed income revenue grew due to better demand and
the move in the yield curve, and the addition of Duncan-Williams for two months of the quarter added $7.5 million
of noninterest revenue. We're glad to have acquired Duncan-Williams. The fixed income business was strong this
quarter and the outlook is good with the excess liquidity on bank balance sheets, including those of the over 1,000
correspondent banks we serve.
On noninterest expense, total NIE, excluding merger-related expenses, was $219 million, down approximately $1
million from Q4. Duncan-Williams represented approximately $6 million in NIE, a little over half of which was
commissions, for the two months it was in the company this quarter. Excluding Duncan-Williams, our NIE was
$212.5 million.
We continue to be on schedule with our cost save realization. With our late May conversion date, we'll begin to
see further expense savings in Q3 and Q4. At present, we expect Q4 NIE to be in the $210 million to $215 million
range. This includes Duncan-Williams for a full quarter and is after inflationary merit increases across the
company beginning July 1. However, I'll remind you of the expense variability inherent in commission-based
revenue. Our total merger-related expenses are still on track to be within our original modeling, with
approximately $75 million remaining, and most of that will occur in the second and third quarter of this year, with
some to trail in subsequent quarters.
I'll now discuss credit. With respect to CECL and the allowance, significant improvement in economic projections
impacting our loss drivers led to a meaningful reduction in the allowance for credit losses. These improved
economic forecasts caused us to record a negative provision for loan losses of $58 million. For this quarter's
weighting of Moody's economic scenarios and our CECL modeling, we rated baseline and the more pessimistic
S3 scenarios equally versus the two-thirds baseline, one-third S3 weighting in Q4. This quarter's weighting
reflects uncertainty in the economic forecast and vaccination penetration and success, which uncertainty should
lessen over time.
Looking ahead, as we obtain additional clarity and, therefore, confidence in the economic forecasts, we would
expect the weighting of the S3 scenario to reduce over time. Holding all other factors constant, that would result in
additional future reserve releases if that were to occur. That would be incremental to any reserve releases caused

by improvements in the economic forecasts themselves. It's, of course, hard to predict the speed and the
magnitude of such releases. We are pleased that our actual losses have, thus far, been well-below modeled
expectations, but the nature of the pandemic-driven recession and the fiscal response are not captured in the
historical data driving these models.
On that note, as shown on slide 19, we had another quarter of excellent loss results with a small net recovery.
Our past dues, criticized and classified assets, remained low, our NPAs declined for a third consecutive quarter,
and our referrals dropped below 1%. Our ending reserve levels, excluding PPP loans, were 1.96% or 1.8%
excluding the reserve for unfunded commitments, still well above the approximately 115-basis-point level at CECL
adoption.
Turning to capital. With a negative provision expense and higher net income, we formed capital at a higher rate
this quarter with a 22% ROTCE. If the negative provision were removed, our ROTCE would have been almost
16% on a balance sheet with a very strong CET1 ratio over 12%. Ending tangible book value per share grew to
$42.02, up $0.86 from Q4. Compared with a year ago, which was the last quarter prior to our MOE closing,
tangible book value per share is up over $4, which is 10.5% growth in a year of a pandemic and a significant
merger.
As noted in the release, we'll be calling $25 million and 6% sub debt when the call window opens in June.
Additionally, we will be in this quarter some older trust preferred securities we inherited in various acquisitions.
These TruPS have a weighted average cost slightly above 6.5% and a fair value mark of approximately $11
million that will be accelerated in Q2. The payback of this hit to earnings will be around four to five years.
Our strong capital position provides us with several opportunities for deployment, whether on organic growth,
capital returns to shareholders, fintech investments, line of business acquisitions or traditional M&A.
With that, I'll turn it back to you, John.

John C. Corbett
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
All right. Thank you, Will. Between the merger, CECL adoption and PPP, there are a lot of moving parts for you to
analyze. We're firm believers, however, that the simplest test of performance is the growth of tangible book value
per share over time. As Will said, we're pleased to have grown tangible book value per share by 10.5% during a
challenging year.
I'll now turn the call back to the operator, so we can open the line for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes
from Jennifer Demba with Truist. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Thank you. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Question, the thoughts on growing the securities book further while we're waiting for loan demand to improve. I
know rates are up, so it's a little more attractive now, but what are your thoughts on growing the securities book
more over the short term?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Dean Young Q
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yes, Jennifer. It's Steve. We have a couple slides in the deck that I'll point you to. Page 12 in our earnings deck
kind of describes the buildup of liquidity over the past five quarters of the combined company. And just a couple of
comments there before I answer your question. You can see that right before we announced our merger in
January 2020, we had about $4.7 billion of investable assets and the 10-year Treasury was sitting at 1.92%. If
you fast forward to today, we have $10.9 billion of investable assets and the 10-year Treasury, as it went through
the trial, is now back to the 1.74% range.
So, I think your question is a timely question. As we manage the securities book over the last year, remember,
when we put the two banks together, [ph] we have to have these (18:25) the fair market value accounting in the
second quarter when the 10-year was at its lowest level. And so, we sold off a portion of the old CenterState
securities just to wait until there was a better time to reinvest. So, I think we're really glad that we did that and
we're strategic in that.
So, if you look at our portfolio today, our portfolio is around $5 billion and we have about $5 billion of excess cash
over what we normally show. Page 13 shows where our peers are and our peers, as a percentage of the
investments/assets, are around 17% to 18%, but we're only at 14%. So, as we look forward over the next several
quarters, we would like to get somewhere in the 16% to 17% of assets range and just average it in over time,
knowing that rates continue to change and continue to move, and we want to be long-term focused. But we also
have, as we understand, more liquidity than we had originally thought and you can see that in that graph. So, that
16% to 17% of assets is roughly another – between $1 billion, $1.5 billion of securities as we think and we'll
continue to look at that every quarter.

Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Thank you. [ph] I have (19:50) one follow-up on asset quality. Your loan losses have been incredibly low recently
and over the longer term. Can you just talk about what you think the right range of net charge-offs is that we
should see for SouthState over a cycle? It looks like, I'm guessing, these losses have come in much better than
you have guessed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Hey, Jennifer, it's John. The level of charge-offs naturally is going to change in a cyclical business, depending
upon where we are in the cycle. I think if you look back at the history of CenterState and SouthState, you'll see a
consistency that both companies have been in the top quartile as it relates to charge-offs. And I do not see our
underwriting standards changing. I would anticipate that to be the case going forward as well.

Operator: The next question is from Michael Rose with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Will, I just wanted to get a sense for where we
stand in terms of the cost savings that you've realized. I think it was $80 million. How much of that has been
realized? And obviously, I understand your comments on the core expense base. I think you said $210 million to
$215 million for the second quarter. But it does seem like on the fee side, with Duncan and Williams, and kind of
strong activity in some of those fee lines of business, even mortgages, you talked about pipelines being up, might
you expect those expenses to maybe be a little bit higher? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Sure, Michael. Maybe I'll start by sort of giving you a reconcile, if you will. So, second quarter of last year, the
quarter we announced – or the quarter we merged, our noninterest expense was $222 million, $223 million. So, of
our $80 million cost save estimate, that'd be $20 million a quarter. And within that [ph] $8 million or $2 million
(22:05) a quarter is really an offset in the noninterest income line related to our debit card contracts that we
negotiated. So, it flows through up there as opposed to an NIE.
So, if we took that $222 million, $223 million drop of $18 million now, which is about $204 million, that's before the
addition of Duncan-Williams, which as you saw in this quarter, their two months NIE were about $6.1 million.
That's, of course, going to vary with the revenue and they had a good revenue quarter as they are likely to have in
this environment with the interest rates and liquidity where they are.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2021
And then also, we have in July will be annual merit increases for our staff, which is more an inflationary type.
That's about $2.5 million per quarter. So, just reconciling that fact that $222 million, $223 million minus $18 million
gets you to about the $204 million, $205 million. You [indiscernible] (23:07) merit increases gets you to, say, $207
million and then Duncan-Williams [indiscernible] (23:12) what their quarter looks like is somewhere in that range
of $210 million to $215 million for the fourth quarter. We'll have a little bit more in cost save recognition in the
second and third quarter, that gets you down to $210 million to $215 million and maybe it could be on the low end
of that if commissions revenue is not as high on the higher end if it's much better than our net interest income.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. I appreciate the reconciliation there. And maybe just on the margin front, obviously a lot of moving pieces
with PPP and the PAA. But if we exclude both those items, would you expect the margin, the kind of core margin
come down just given the securities purchases that you made, what appear to be later in the quarter, and then
future securities purchases and just repricing lower of loan yields as we move forward? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Dean Young Q
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Sure, Michael. It's Steve. And let me just take you through a couple of thoughts as we work through it. So, page
21 in our deck, we talk about our core deposit franchise and I just think it's important to highlight that particularly
as rates continue to move and they certainly are moving higher. That's going to be the really key for a long-term
success relative to our margin. But if you look at our core deposits, 33% of them are in DDA, 56% of them are in
checking accounts. And when you look at the graph to our peers, 56% versus our peers at 39%, that really should
outperform in a higher rate environment. So, as we think about the long term, that's where we think there's a ton
of value.
To get directly to your question, on page 10, we show our core margin accretion over the last several quarters.
And just the things I would point out to you there, in core margin dollars, which is really what we're focused on,
primarily just because of a growth in the balance sheet, but you'll see in the first quarter, it was $231.2 million,
with two fewer days in the fourth quarter. If you normalize the number of days for the fourth quarter, that core
margin or the core dollars would have been dead flat.
And so, as we think about the rest of the year, we're flattening off this quarter, next quarter in core margin dollars.
And then, as we think about deploying the cash into securities and cash [indiscernible] (25:50) more importantly
into loans over the next 6 to 12 months, that's going to provide some tailwind to the core margin dollars. So,
hopefully, that gives you the framework to help you model.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
It does. Thank you very much, Steve. And then maybe just finally for me, just on the M&A front, I know we got
systems conversion coming up. You guys are going to build capital here pretty nicely, especially if you do have
some more reserve releases when the PPP comes off. What would the combined organization now be looking for
in a transaction, maybe both in terms of size and markets? I assume would be in your expanded footprint, but
would just love any color there. Thanks.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2021
Yeah, Michael. It's John. I think we've been pretty consistent in our communication that 2021 is all about getting
the foundation in place for the future. So, we've been very internally focused on getting this MOE done right and I
believe we are. As we get past the conversion in the second quarter, we think about the future, there's a whole lot
more clarity now about the economy. And to your point, we are generating a fair amount of capital. So, the way
we look at it, Michael, is we just want to be positioned to be opportunistic in deploying that capital.
So, we think in our markets, with the way the economy is coming back, there's going to be strong organic growth
opportunities. We do think there's going to be M&A opportunities and our preference would be to expand in the
markets that we're currently already in. And then, there's also opportunities, we believe, to invest in ourselves
through buybacks. So, I think we've got all three options on the menu and so, we'll just have to see quarter-by-
quarter what's the best option for our company.

Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I was just kind of curious maybe if you could talk to the kind of expected pace of new hires from here, assuming
those expectations have been already built into kind of that expense guidance. But just wondering what you see
as the opportunity set as you look to continue to drive growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah. Thanks, Stephen. We've had good success in the fourth quarter and the first quarter in hiring. I mentioned
we hired 10 new middle market and commercial bankers in the first quarter. And wouldn't be surprised if that
doesn't continue in the 5 to 10 per quarter range for the next two or three quarters. There's just a lot of disruption
with some of the biggest banks in our market, and look for that to continue. Fortunately, we've been able to
continue to add and have not expanded the expense base greatly. So, I don't know if it's going to be a big needle
mover in terms of expense, but I'd love to see us continue at the current pace we're at 5 to 10.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. And then, John, as you mentioned, you guys are in some of the best markets in the country from an
in-migration perspective. So, I don't know that new markets are necessarily on the radar, but wondering if you're
considering team lift-outs or otherwise to expand into any new MSAs across the footprint.

John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
It's not a high focus right now, Stephen. Part of the rationale of SouthState and CenterState coming together is
the six-state footprint that we're currently in. So, you think about what's going on in Atlanta, Greenville, Charlotte,
Orlando, Tampa, there's plenty of opportunities in the markets we're in. We've got some scale in those markets,
but would love to continue to have greater density in those markets and we're really going to focus on hiring
efforts in those markets.

Good morning.

Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Wanted just to circle back, maybe first on the expense conversation, Will, and wanted to clarify about mortgage
expenses that you have, mortgage commissions are net in fees. And so, a decline in mortgage revenue perhaps
won't necessarily result in a big change in the expense base. Is that the correct way to think about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. I mean, as you and I have talked before, we do net identifiable costs associated with the mortgage
production against revenue produced [ph] properly we think (30:33). But we do have – the fixed income business,
for example, is one that has commission base. The same is true with our ARC business, those are both
commission-based business lines as well. And so, if the fixed income demand changes, that's going to change
the commission expense base there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Okay. So more kind of thinking about the fixed income [ph] bend (30:57) and mortgage. That makes sense.
Okay. And then, how about on loan growth? I know that loans declined a little bit this quarter. It seems like you're
optimistic about growth to improve in the back half of the year. John, are you still kind of thinking about a low- to
mid-single-digit growth rate or do you think that could be even better in the back half of the year, particularly just
given the kind of population growth and economic trends you're seeing in some of your markets?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2021
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah. Catherine, I met with the board yesterday and I told them that I feel like we're operating an eight-cylinder
engine that's been fired on about six cylinders because of the pandemic, the conversion, the MOE. Once we get
the conversion behind us in the second quarter, I really feel like we're going to be back to running on all eight
cylinders. We're encouraged to see in the last three quarters consecutive growth in C&I, although total
commercial has been somewhat flat.
The main headwind for loan growth has really been in the residential mortgage and HELOC area, not because of
a lack of volume. We did $1.3 billion in residential last quarter. We just felt like it was a better use of capital to
direct those loans to the secondary market, where we had record-high gain on sales and low long-term rate.
That's changing now. And as rates start to move up, it's more likely that we're going to pull more of those ARM
loans onto the balance sheet.
But looking ahead, once we get past the conversion in the second quarter, our expectations in the second half of
the year are for loan growth to return back to mid-single-digit growth. You think about the companies historically
have been 5% to 10% growers through the cycle. We're going to put more residential on the loan portfolio in the
second half. We've had all these new hires that are building their pipeline and they're going to start putting that
production on the books in the second half. And there's been a lot of construction lending in the first half of the
year that will fund up in the second half of the year.
So, you think about the future of the second half of this year, you go into 2022, the economy's reopening,
consumers and businesses, we believe, are going to start spending their cash, and we think that loan growth
could really accelerate from here.

come away from this deal, looking at the scale you have now, because that – we've seen a lot of merger activity

about all the growth opportunity you have in your footprint? Or would you ever entertain doing something like this
again with the thought that, hey, if increased scale was this beneficial, it's even more beneficial to be that much
bigger, or is that just really out of the realm of possibilities? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah. Let me take it a step back and if I think through the last decade, I think it was very critical that we built the
company the way we did to build the scale that we have today in the markets that we're in. Now, having said that,
I don't feel like there's the same urgency in the next decade to have to grow through M&A the way we felt that
urgency in the last decade. I think where we're positioned now, we're just positioned in the [indiscernible] (34:59).
We can grow organically. There are M&A opportunities. There's opportunities to invest in our own stock.
So, I don't feel the urgency that we felt in the last decade, but we do feel like there will be opportunities. It's just
not necessary for us to compete anymore with the big banks. We can compete today with the platform that we
built.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Great. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up. Will, you mentioned during your prepared comments the ACL ratio
and I just want to make sure I'm thinking about that correctly. So, is that where we're at ex-PPP about 1.8% today
and that can come down – day one was about 1.15%? Is that what you said? Just want to make sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. Yeah, Kevin. And keep in mind, the two companies were not combined when we both adopted CECL. So
that's an approximation. I mean, I guess the way to think about it is we are at levels well above where we were
when we adopted CECL. The economy changed a lot over the last year. We're still about [indiscernible] (36:02) in
the economic forecasts that we had an appropriately conservative economic forecast mix in our provision model
this quarter. But if – there's a lot of ifs there. But if one were to assume that the economy were to return back to
the levels it was when the industry adopted CECL, absent other changes in portfolios and whatnot, it's reasonable
to expect that the industry would return back to levels about where it was when it adopted CECL on an allowance
perspective and we're still well north of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Great. And I would just assume, given the uncertainties you talked about, you would go out of your way to maybe
make that a more measured return as opposed to a fast return.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
I don't want to [indiscernible] (36:54) we're managing because that's not what we're doing, but there is enough
uncertainty in the economic picture and that's changing. Now, if you look at the forecast changes from Q3 to Q4,
Q4 to Q1, they're very large magnitude in a short period of time and the models are [ph] trained (37:14) on an
economic scenario that's really unlike any – unlike what we experience today and a fiscal response, something
like that.

So, we're being thoughtful about that and making sure that we do see greater clarity. But it looks like everyday
things do seem to be improving. So, we'll have more information as time goes on and hope it will allow us to feel
more comfortable as the economy really is getting back where we like it to be.

Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. There have been a few questions about bank M&A. But taking a step back, looking at like the Duncan-
Williams deal, are there businesses that you would really be interested in doing, kind of business line or fee
income-related acquisitions like that as they become available?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Dean Young Q
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah, Kevin. This is Steve. We're always on the lookout for those things that would bolt on to businesses we
understand. And I think, for us, Duncan-Williams was a great complement to both our correspondent business
and our fixed income business that gave us several hundred more clients. So now we have over 1,000 new client
banks, which just gives us more products to sell, more clients to talk to. We would also look for wealth
management opportunities, things that we're already in. But from a standpoint of deploying capital, that's just one
of the levers we're always looking for.

flattish quarter-over-quarter.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2021
Sure, Brody. We referenced page 15 in our deck and I'll – maybe I can just take that and give you kind of the
overall picture. We went through our systems conversion in January. And remember, we intentionally slowed
down the pipeline in December in order to get that accomplished. And that's exactly what happened. Our pipeline
went down to $674 million at the end of the fourth quarter and grew up to $945 million, so significant growth in the
pipeline.
Production this quarter was $1.3 billion. If you go back a year ago the same quarter, just to take some of the
seasonality, it was about $1 billion. So, it's up 30%. So, again, the production is really working there. And as you
think about the comment around secondary versus portfolio, we had about two-thirds of our production was sold
and then about a third of it was portfolio lending, and a lot of that portfolio lending was construction that will fund
up over time.
As we go through this change of rates, we're very – we're continuing to be bullish on the actual production just
because we do 60% the last quarter, 63% purchase. But as we think about the mix, it might be, and we'll just have
to see, that we get a little bit more into the portfolio and a little less with secondary. So, as you look at the seesaw
between noninterest income and loan growth, that's the thing you've got to look at. And for us, we're just trying to
produce at the level where we've been producing at and we're pretty bullish about that. But from a standpoint of
where that production goes, I would think that over the next several quarters, we might see a little bit more in the
portfolio and a little less to the secondary, if I had to guess.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Got it. And I guess, just then as I think about the fee guidance that you gave last quarter, I think you've
guided down about 10% from that [ph] 4.20% (41:23) combined level for the year. But with mortgage presumably
getting tougher for everybody throughout the year and it sounds like you're going to portfolio a little bit more of it,
could you maybe help me better understand how you're going to get to that 10%, that, call it, I think it's like [ph]
3.80% or so, 3.75% to 3.80% (41:43), how you get there via other fee income lines?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Dean Young Q
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Sure, Brody. I mean, I guess, you take this quarter and annualize it, that's probably a little higher than that [ph]
3.80% (41:58). It's probably closer to [ph] 3.90% (42:00) number for the year. But the way we think about it and
the way we've always thought about it is we want to make sure that our target, our goal is to have 1% of our fee
income to average assets. And, of course, we've had a lot of bloating in the average assets over the last quarter,
we had about $2 billion worth of growth. But if you look at that during normal times, that's where we want to be,
where we think that between service charges, between correspondent, between mortgage, all of those things
average out around 1%. And in times when it's volatile and rates are moving all over the place, you'll see our
percentage noninterest income to average asset be much higher. And I think last year, we probably hit
somewhere between 1.15% and 1.20%. But in a more normal environment, we would look to see that number to
manage towards a 1% over a long period of time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Understood. And then, just on the margin, I wanted to ask – I'm sorry if I missed what you said earlier –
what new origination yields were for the loan portfolio?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2021
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah, Brody. They were 3.41% and that's coupon only, 3.41% in the first quarter. And that's up 4 basis points
from Q4's 3.37%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Understood. So, when I back out the PPP, the PAA, the core loan yield was down about 8 basis points or
so in this quarter. And so, I just wanted to get a sense for what you thought the quarterly rate of compression on
the loan yield would be moving forward at core number?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. Brody, this is Steve. To your point, our loan yield ex-PPP, ex-accretion is right around 4%. I think it might
be 3.99%. So, we did have 8 basis points or 9 basis points of compression. And I would expect that probably to
continue until we get the equilibrium between loan yield and loan production, and that's where the – and the
excess cash.
Just as you all think about modeling maybe from a longer-term perspective, John mentioned this in his opening
comments, but we have this $5 billion of excess liquidity that's sitting on our balance sheet more than we would
normally use. And as we think about the deployment of that excess liquidity, we already spoke about the
securities that we would move that up over time closer to peer levels, maybe $1.5 billion. And then, by the end of
2022, maybe there's a couple of billion dollars that we've deployed in loans. And so, that leaves us still $1.5 billion
to $2 billion worth of just dry powder that gives us the ability to – if some of the deposits shrink a little bit or we
have faster loan growth that we can deploy. So, that's kind of how we're thinking kind of medium to long term
about this excess liquidity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Understood that. And to that point, just with the capital you're building, the excess liquidity you have, I can
appreciate what you're doing in the second quarter with some of the sub debt and the TruPS redemptions. I just
wanted to maybe better understand, when can you call the rest of the sub debt and, I guess, what's stopping you
from just taking down the whole 3.90% just because it's costing you about $5 million a quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. So, the sub debt issues, in general, and the biggest one that we did last year, yeah, it's not callable for five
years from issuance. And then, once you – so within five years of maturity, 10-year maturity, 5-year non-call, the
capital treatment begins to amortize radically within five years of maturity. That's when you generally want to call
sub debt just because you start to lose the capital treatment. So, the $25 million [ph] fees (45:56) I referenced is
one that we inherited in the [ph] Incom (46:00) acquisition that was issued back in 2016.
The others are smaller pieces, I mean we got a handful of them, that were inherent in acquisitions that really
weren't issued as sub debt but were actually issued as trust preferreds, but they have Tier 2 capital treatment
given our size. And they were marked at the fair value at purchase in our June fair value marks and those were
yielding north of 6.5%. So, we took the ones that looked to be the obvious ones where the paybacks seem

reasonable to go ahead and wipe those out this quarter. But the others, like the large piece sub debt, it will be – it
was issued last year in May. So, May of 2020, so five years from there would be our call date there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Got it. And then, just on the capital front, I hear you on the bank M&A. But John, you have mentioned
investing in SouthState and buying back stock. And so, I know you got the new authorization from last quarter and
so, I wanted to ask. I know the multiple is higher than sum, but it sounds like you think it should be even higher
from here. So, I guess, when should we expect you to start buying back stock?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah. We think the stock is attractive buy where it is today. So, as we get more clarity about the economy, more
clarity about tax code, look for us to be more bullish on ourselves and we'll have to evaluate that every quarter
with other opportunities, but we're feeling much more bullish about investing in ourselves than we have when
there was less clarity.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Got it. And then, just on the loan growth, the pipeline was up to $4.2 billion I heard you say on the
commercial front and that's up from $3.3 billion last quarter's call. And so, it sounds like that's up nicely. What
should we expect from a pull-through rate on that? I'm just trying to better understand when we should expect to
see CRE growth return and C&I growth pickup from this quarter's run rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, South State Corp.
Yeah. So, the pull-through rate the last two or three quarters has been about 35% and it fluctuates naturally up
and down from there. So, we've been seeing commercial loan. This is commercial loan-only production in the $1.3
billion, $1.4 billion range. So, as the pipeline grows, we're up to $4.2 billion. It's likely that we'll see a third or more
of that convert to commercial loan production in the second quarter. The variable here that's uncontrollable is
payoffs and we have had some payoffs in April, but we think that pipeline continues to grow as the economy
reopens. And with that pull-through rate, we think we could easily see mid-single digits in the back half of the
year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
All right. And then last one for me, I heard the Duncan-Williams expense number. Did you guys give a revenue
number for what they did this quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A

Well, it's like any business where you have some component of fixed expenses and some component of
variables, so that as revenue moves up, the percentage of expenses will go down, and then conversely, the
opposite is true [ph] it's been down (49:37). A little over half of that $6.1 million was commissioned, though. So,

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, FIG Partners LLC
Hey, thanks. Good morning. Steve answered one of my questions just about the percentage of assets on the fee
income side. But if we kind of take that another step, Steven or John, and look at the spread relative to average
assets, you're roughly, I think, 280 basis points. As you put the liquidity to work, does that spread naturally rise or
is there an issue with just having overall margins and spreads getting wider to kind of affect that? I'm just trying to
break down the pre-tax ROA and kind of where it's going to go over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Dean Young Q
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Sure, Chris. This is Steve. I think as it relates to the margin, it's really difficult because of all the excess liquidity.
At the end of the first quarter, our average earnings are [indiscernible] (50:40) interest earning assets were
significantly higher than the average earning assets for the quarter because all the liquidity piled in, in February
and March. So, I would expect this from a margin perspective for the actual percentage to go down from this past
quarter just because we ended up with such an influx in liquidity toward the end of the quarter.
But what you'll see over time is that margin will bottom-out. And as we deploy the cash and the loans and we
deploy the cash into securities, assuming that rates don't fall from here, they'll start gradually increasing from that
level. So, I would expect that as we continue to do that toward the end of the year, you would start seeing that
inflecting in the third quarter, fourth quarter, and hopefully as it goes into 2022 at a higher level.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, FIG Partners LLC
Okay. Great. And then, back to the fees, we know the volatility in the mortgage business over time, but do you
think the capital markets business will be as volatile or do you think you'll be able to manage that to where it's
more steady, maybe more wealth management-like in terms of the returns and just building that over time?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2021
Steven Dean Young Q
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Sure. Page 16, we've put in the deck this time, that showed sort of where the revenue came from and it's kind of
interesting to look at. On the top right graph, it shows the difference between sort of our – what we call our ARC
revenues, our interest rate swap revenues and our fixed income revenues. And you can see in 2020, it was much
more weighted towards our interest rate swap revenues and that was because of the shape of the yield curve was
flat and it's low.
What you saw in the first quarter was the curve got steeper and so, our ARC revenue fell a little bit just because
it's not as advantageous to hedge. But because all the liquidity, it really – the fixed income revenue went up. And
so, the way I kind of think about that business, just particularly because we've been talking about it, is there's
been a massive liquidity put into the banking system and a lot of deposit growth. We're seeing this not only for
ourselves, our peers, but also for our correspondent banks.
So, as you think over the next two years, what's going to happen to that liquidity, either we're going to loan it or
they're going to invest it. And so, for us, I think we're positioned well in the correspondent bank to help them do
both. When they invest it, we'll do it on the fixed income revenue side. And when they loan it, there'll be certain
amount of hedging that we do for our clients as they continue the loan growth because they already have the
deposit growth.

John, one last one, just on the efficiency ratio. If you kind of back out purchase accounting accretion and PPP
from the efficiency ratio, it was, maybe this quarter, I think on the mid [audio gap] (53:59). As we think about PPP
going away and maybe in 2022, as the PAA continues to wind down, how do you get that sort of efficiency ratio
once you get past the core conversion? How do you get that trending back more closer to [audio gap] (54:19)?

Steven Dean Young Q
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corp.
Brody, this is Steve. I'll follow up with just a portion of the PPP before I turn it over to Will on that efficiency piece. I
think you all caught this from the release, but just from a more technical perspective, there's $33 million worth of
PPP accretion left in the book. We think that, rough number, 75% of that will come in this year, depending on the
forgiveness, but that's kind of how we're thinking about it. And then 2022, we'll get the remainder, so that'll maybe
help you in your modeling.

And then, also on the on the loan accretion, just because you mentioned it, in the release, we have $87 million of
that left in the release. But as we think about efficiency ratio, we've always thought about it in terms of core. And
so much of this is driven by the yield curve. I mean, we just talked about it. As we continue to grow core net
interest income, that efficiency ratio will naturally fall. It's really a revenue issue, more than it is expense issue.

William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corp.
Yeah. I'd also say the same thing, Brody. To me, the efficiency ratio story is much more about our revenue. And
obviously, we've got $5 billion on our balance sheet that earned 8 basis points last quarter. And doing something
with that will do far more for our efficiency ratio going forward.
