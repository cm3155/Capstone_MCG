Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings
Conference Call. My name is Alan, and I'll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only
mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event
is being recorded.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may
begin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kristin Silberberg
Head-Investor Relations, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and
CEO, Bruce van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of third quarter results referencing our
presentation, which you can find on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we'll be happy to take
questions. Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking; and Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking, are
also here to provide additional color.
Our comments today will include forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may
cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on page 2 of the
presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures. So, it's important to review our GAAP results on
page 3 of the presentation and the reconciliation in the appendix.
And with that, I will hand over to Bruce.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Thanks, Kristin. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We had a successful and busy third
quarter featuring continued strong execution of our strategic initiatives, good financial performance with positive
operating leverage and 7% sequential PPNR growth and the announcement of three acquisitions. We are playing
offense, and we feel that we are taking the steps to position us for solid growth and franchise value in earnings
and in returns.
Our financial performance in Q3 reflects strong revenue growth up 3% sequentially as both net interest income
and fees grew nicely. NII benefited from a pickup in spot loan growth with retail up 3% and commercial up 1%,
excluding PPP impact from loan forgiveness. The gradual improvement in loan volumes we have expected is
materializing though held back a modest amount in Q3 by impacts from the Delta variant on the recovery, as well
as by supply chain issues and labor shortages. These impacts should continue to abate going forward, and we
expect even faster loan growth in Q4.
Interestingly, the amount of PPP forgiveness is roughly equivalent in the first and second halves of 2021, though
Q3 saw a meaningful pull forward, which benefits Q3 at the expense of Q4. Nonetheless, the faster loan growth
we expect in Q4 should largely offset the lower PPP impact on Q4 net interest income.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
Strong sequential fee growth once again demonstrated the diversity of our business model. Mortgage had a
bounce back quarter, which helped offset some seasonality in Capital Markets fees, while Wealth hit a new record
and consumer fees continued their recovery towards pre-pandemic levels. We expect this diversification to play
out again in Q4, with Capital Markets poised for a strong quarter given exceptional pipeline and Mortgage set for
a seasonally softer quarter. We kept expenses under control given our efficiency initiatives which led to positive
sequential operating leverage of around 2.5%.
And credit continues to be in great shape, with NCOs of 14 basis points in the quarter, well below our guidance
range for the quarter of 20 to 25 basis points. The strong results across expenses and credit should continue into
Q4. The strategic initiatives we're focused on across consumer and commercial continue to go well, and there's
more on that in the presentation. We feel we are focused on prioritizing the areas where we can differentiate
ourselves and where we have a right to win.
The acquisitions we've announced year-to-date are all attractive from a strategic and financial standpoint and
present only modest execution risk. The Investors of HSBC transactions give us a top 10 deposit market share in
New York City Metro and over 1 million new customers who collectively we feel we can do more for. We also
gained a big augmentation to our digital bank customer base from HSBC's online bank and we gained a 10-
branch network in Washington, D.C. and Miami. Our integration efforts so far are progressing nicely.
Our JMP acquisition is also strategically compelling. Upon closing the deal in mid Q4, we'll have a much broader
and deeper corporate finance coverage in technology, healthcare and financial services plus we gained an
equities business that is very well run, focused and highly regarded. As non-bank lenders continue to take lending
market share from banks and private equity ownership of companies continues to increase, it's important that we
broaden our capabilities to be able to compete successfully in this new landscape. We will increasingly generate
more fee revenue across our customer base given these expanded capabilities.
Also worth noting is that the Willamette transaction dramatically expands our valuation services business with a
prestigious outfit. This capability is highly synergistic with our M&A and broader capital markets effort.
So to sum up, we're taking serious strides forward as an organization in 2021 and we feel very good about our
positioning and our future outlook.
With that, I'll turn it over to John.

Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. First, I'll start with the headlines for the quarter. We reported
underlying net income of $546 million and EPS of $1.22. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 14.2% which
includes the impact of a modest credit provision benefit. Revenue at $1.7 billion was up 3% linked-quarter given
growth in both fee income and net interest income. Period-end loans were up 1% in the quarter with strong
originations in retail and commercial. Loans were up 2% excluding PPP forgiveness, giving us good momentum
heading into the fourth quarter.
Key highlights include strong results in Capital Markets notwithstanding seasonality, another strong quarter for
Wealth, and a rebound in Mortgage fees. And we delivered positive sequential operating leverage of over 2% this
quarter with well-controlled expenses. We recorded a credit provision benefit of $33 million, which reflects strong
credit performance with lower charge-offs. Our ACL ratio is now at 1.65%, excluding PPP loans. We are in a very
strong capital position with CET1 at 10.3% after returning $167 million to shareholders in dividends during the

quarter. And, finally, we continue to grow our tangible book value per share, which was $34.44 at quarter-end, up
7% compared with a year ago.
Next, I'll provide some key takeaways for the third quarter while referring to the presentation slides. Net interest
income on slide 6 was up 2% linked quarter, given interest-earning asset growth, stable net interest margin and
higher day count. The net interest margin was 2.72%, flat sequentially as the benefit of accelerated PPP
forgiveness and improved funding costs were offset by the impact of higher cash balances as well as lower
earning-asset yields given low rates.
One highlight is our continued progress on lowering interest-bearing deposit costs, which are down 2 basis points
to 14 basis points. Our asset sensitivity decreased to about 9.8% from 10.7% at the end of the second quarter.
The decrease primarily reflects loan and deposit exchanges and the addition of $2.5 billion in received-fixed
swaps in the quarter. We saw good entry points for the swaps given some steepening in the yield curve. So, far in
the fourth quarter, we have added another $1.25 billion. The hedging actions we've executed to-date in 2021 are
one of the levers we are pulling to address headwinds from swap run off and other impacts of a low rate
environment.
We expect to continue adding to the received-fixed swap portfolio and further moderate our asset sensitivity
[indiscernible] (08:43) while maintaining meaningful upside benefit to higher short-term rates.
Referring to slide 7, we delivered solid fee results this quarter, demonstrating the strength and diversity of our fee
income with strong results in Capital Markets and Wealth. Mortgage fees rebounded in the quarter, up $23 million
as production fees benefited from lower agency fees, and we saw improvement in MSR hedge results.
Diving further into this performance, production revenue was up $12 million linked quarter, benefiting from a
modest improvement in gain on sale margins across channels given improved agency pricing and favorable
execution. This was partially offset by a decline in [indiscernible] (09:27) down sequentially about 10%, which is
broadly in line with industry level trends. As expected, we continue to see a shift towards purchase originations,
which increased from about 48% of the total in second quarter to about 54% in the third quarter.
The contribution from servicing operations decreased $4 million linked quarter, reflecting higher MSR
amortization. Our third-party servicing book grew to $87 billion, up 3% linked quarter and 8% year-over-year.
Lastly, our MSR hedging results improved $15 million linked quarter, given an unusually large negative result in
Q2. Capital markets were down a bit from record levels, reflecting seasonality, particularly in syndication fees.
However, M&A advisory fees were higher and our pipeline heading into the fourth quarter is exceptionally strong.
Wealth fees were up slightly continuing to build on record levels, reflecting an increase in assets under
management from net inflows.
Moving on to other positive fee contributors, we saw improvements in service charges and fee and card fees,
which benefited from a strengthening economy as debit transactions and credit card spend continued to exceed
pre-pandemic levels.
On slide 8, expenses were well-controlled, up 1% linked quarter as good expense discipline and the benefit of
efficiency initiatives largely offset higher operational and travel costs. Period-end loans on slide 9 were up 1%
linked quarter or 2% excluding PPP. Retail loans were growing, up 3% and commercial loans were up 1%
excluding PPP in a tough operating environment. Average loans were down 1%, but still up 1% excluding PPP.

Diving into drivers a bit more; the diversity of our retail lending business produced another quarter of record
originations, but we continue to see high payoffs. Strength was noteworthy in mortgage, auto and education.
Commercial is seeing strong underlying activity with spot loans up 1% in the quarter, excluding PPP. We had a
very robust origination quarter led by commercial real estate, asset backed lending and subscription line
financing, supporting deal-related activity. This was largely offset by continued elevated payoff activity, which in
part reflects favorable conditions for commercial companies to access the debt capital markets.
Line utilization levels were up around 50 basis points, still near historic lows. We foresee a gradual recovery in
coming quarters as some of the issues holding back investment such as supply chain challenges and labor
shortages resolve themselves. In addition, our period end commitments are up around 2%, which will benefit us
down the road once investment picks up. Overall, spot loan growth of 2% for the quarter ex-PPP provides good
underlying momentum for loan growth in the fourth quarter.
On slide 10, deposit flows continue to be robust especially in low-cost categories and our liquidity ratios remained
strong. Average deposits were up 1% linked quarter and 7% year-over-year with strong demand in demand
deposits, which now make up 32% of total deposits. Interest-bearing deposits were broadly stable as the decline
in term deposits was offset by growth in demand deposits and low-cost categories.
We continued to make good progress on deposit [ph] repricing (13:01) with total deposit costs down 2 basis
points to 9 basis points. Interest-bearing deposit costs were down 2 basis points to 14 basis points during the
quarter with opportunity to reduce further.
Moving on to credit on slide 11 and 12, we saw excellent credit results this quarter. Net charge-offs dropped from
25 basis points to 14 basis points for the third quarter driven by improvements across the portfolio. Non-accrual
loans decreased 4% linked quarter. Given the improving outlook and strong performance of the portfolio, our
reserves decreased, ending the quarter at 1.65% ex-PPP compared with 1.75% at the end of the second quarter.
Moving to slide 13, we maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio remained stable at 10.3% at
the end of the third quarter after returning $167 million in capital to shareholders through dividends in the quarter.
This is at the top of our list of capital priorities on the slide.
We paused our stock repurchase program pending the investor shareholder vote scheduled for November 19.
After the vote, we have the opportunity to resume repurchases with $655 million of capacity remaining under our
current board authorization. The estimated CET1 impact [ph] for the (14:21) pending acquisitions are on the slide
along with the targeted closing time.
Before I move on to our 4Q outlook, let me highlight some exciting things that are happening across the company
on slide 14. Our TOP 6 program is in its final stages. Everything is on track and we will achieve our targeted
results. We are preparing for the launch of a TOP 7 program with more details to follow later this year. These TOP
programs have been critical in the funding of our strategic initiatives and in driving positive operating leverage,
which are key to achieving our medium-term financial targets.
On the ESG front, I'm very excited to say that we've launched a new green deposits program to allow corporate
clients to direct their cash reserves towards companies and projects that are expected to generate a positive
environmental impact by improving energy efficiency, promoting sustainability and reducing greenhouse gases.
An area of high focus for us has been moving more rapidly to digital channels, which we accelerated giving the
behavioral changes we've seen coming out of the pandemic. You can see some of the year-over-year [ph] stats

(15:24) on slide 15. Digital booked sales, for example, are up 24%, mobile active users are up 20%, and the
number of Zelle transactions are up 34%.
We continue to enhance our digital capabilities and by the end of this year, consumers will be able to perform
about three-quarters of all transactions directly through the mobile app. And by the end of 2022 this will include
nearly all transactions. This provides us with strong leverage to continue repositioning our branches towards [ph]
an advice-based (15:54) model.
Moving to slide 16, as part of our ongoing efforts to help customers' better navigate their financial lives, we've
recently announced several initiatives designed to make banking more transparent and accessible including a
new way to avoid overdraft fees and a commitment to helping ensure that underserved communities have access
to banking services. We introduced Citizens Peace of Mind, a new deposit feature providing customers with the
ability to avoid the unnecessary overdraft fees. This feature will come with new capabilities to monitor and alert
customers of overdraft withdrawals and a grace period to fund their account.
The financial impact of our overdraft policy fees will be to forego the return to historical overdraft fee levels. You
can expect 2022 service charges and fees to stabilize around 2021 year-to-date annualized levels. The benefits
of these changes are shown on the right side of slide 16. We expect higher satisfaction, lower attrition and lower
operational costs to offset the forgone overdraft revenues over time.
Lastly, we also announced a new commitment to serving under-banked communities, including the introduction of
a new checking account with no overdraft fees and features that will meet the Bank On National Account
Standards. These are designed to ensure that everyone has access to a transparent, easy-to-use and affordable
transactional account.
And now for some high-level commentary on the outlook on slide 17; we expect NII to be broadly stable to down
slightly, given a lower benefit from PPP forgiveness due to the pull forward into the third quarter. NII is expected
to be up around 2% in the fourth quarter ex-PPP impacts. Most importantly, we are well-positioned to see overall
loan growth accelerate in the fourth quarter with average loans up 1.5% to 2% or 2.5% to 3% ex-PPP and spot
loan growth up around 3% or around 4% ex-PPP. We expect continued strength in retail across mortgage,
education and auto.
And in commercial, we expect to see growth led by subscription line financing, supporting deal-related activity and
asset-backed lending. This loan growth positions us well for 2022 and helps offset the impact from PPP runoff.
Fee income is expected to be broadly stable as a seasonal decline in mortgage, as well as some expected
pressure on margin, given excess industry capacity is expected to be offset by some real strength in capital
markets given exceptional pipelines. Non-interest expenses is expected to be broadly stable in the fourth quarter,
benefiting from our efficiency initiatives, and we expect net charge offs will be broadly stable with the provision
expense lower than net charge offs. I should add that this guidance excludes the impact of the JMP acquisition,
which we are targeting to close in the middle of the fourth quarter.
To wrap up on slide 18, this was a strong quarter for Citizens with good momentum heading into the end of the
year. With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, Mr. van Saun. [Operator Instructions] We'll go to our first question that will be from the line
of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Morning, Scott.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Let's see. John maybe was hoping you could provide a little more color on what's going on with the swap
book that you've been adding to. I was hoping specifically you could sort of talk about the balance between
adding new swaps and maintaining your rate sensitivity. And in particular, I guess, what is your preferred
sensitivity to higher rates? In other words, is there something specifically that we're targeting or how should we be
thinking about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Just kind of big picture here. I mean, I think that we've, as I mentioned, seen some good opportunities to
start in this new sort of steepening cycle to start layering in swaps broadly. As I may have mentioned our asset
sensitivity is down to about 9.8% or so at the end of the third quarter. As we migrate across the entire tightening
cycle that may come, we expect to try to migrate down to something that would be low single digits.
And in order to get there that would require not only the hedging that we've done to-date, which would be about
$12 billion in the third – sorry, in 2021, through October, but would require in all likelihood another $20 billion or so
to get us to a low single digit asset sensitivity when we get near the top of the tightening cycle.
The other thing I'll also offer up is that the acquisitions of ISBC and HSBC will also add asset sensitivity and that'll
require another $1.5 billion or $2 billion to offset. So, big picture, our philosophy is to maintain good upside to
short-term rates, which we have and the majority of our exposure is to short-term rates. And as we continue to
see attractive opportunities to monetize that asset sensitivity, as the yield curve steepens, we'll continue to dollar
cost average into that over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. Thank you. I appreciate that. And then switching gears just a little, I was hoping you could talk
about any differences in deposit growth trends that you're seeing between your retail and your commercial
customers.

John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean, I think we're seeing good uptake. And maybe we'll go ahead and let Don and Brendan highlight.
But in the third quarter, we had growth both in average and spot of 1%. I think that that was driven primarily by
commercial in the quarter, but we're seeing strong deposit flows on both sides. We're still seeing positive growth
on both consumer and commercial. And maybe I'll just offer it up to Don and Brendan to see if they want to add
anything else.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I think that's right. On the commercial side, we're still seeing a lot of deposit flow notwithstanding the fact
we're trying to push pricing down. So, we still have a little bit of surge deposits, but probably $1 billion or $2 billion
we see running off as we go into next year. So, we think deposits will continue to be strong well into 2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Similar trends on the consumer side. The noninterest-bearing deposits have been very sticky. Despite
consumer activity and spending picking up, the deposits have been hanging around. And so, they're still a bit
elevated with the surge deposits. The second and third rounds of stimulus generally were not spent. They were
more saved or used to pay down debt and we're seeing that with the balances hanging around the customers'
pockets.
On the interest-bearing side, we're seeing a rundown of CDs and it's generally replaced with low cost deposits
with basic savings and some low interest-bearing products like [ph] CV (23:21). So, that's allowing the cost of
funds to continue to gear down. Consumer cost of funds all-in is sub 6 basis points now. So, we're kind of at
basement levels and still seeing the deposits very, very sticky.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. One thing to add that with those surge deposits that we suspect most of that stays around and deposits
stay relatively stable over time given organic growth offsets any potential marginal runoff of some of the COVID-
related deposits. So, that's a good sign.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. The one last point to add, it's Bruce, would be the demand deposits now are about 32% of total deposits.
So, that's been an effort where we've really focused on trying to raise that as a percentage of our total funding
base. And we've had some good success on the consumer side in Mass Affluent and growing the commercial
side, and so feel really good about where that sits. Thank you.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a bit about loan pricing trends and I guess especially in
commercial where one of your peers yesterday talked about kind of continued pressure there as new loans have
come on versus kind of what's [ph] rolling off in repricing (24:39).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, why don't I take that? Matt, it's Don. It's holding up pretty well. It depends on the type of transaction. But
we're seeing a little bit of deterioration, but not material. So, you see it in our NIM. Our NIM is holding up nicely.
We're trying to stay disciplined. So where we see things – we haven't changed our approach one bit. So, we look
at overall return on relationships, of which loan spread is a piece of it. So, we'll compromise a little bit our loan
spread if we see other fee business attached to that loan. But if we don't see the fee business, we're not going to
chase yield just to book a loan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, similar discipline in consumer. I'd say there's – some asset classes still are mildly elevated on what we
would tend to see in this rate cycle like [indiscernible] (25:27) spreads are a little bit expanded. We've got front
book, back book challenges given the state of the yield curve at our back book, the runoff is at a higher yield than
what we're putting on.
The front book, returns are still very, very strong. I'd say there's one or two spots, where we're seeing some
intensity of competition on returns, particularly where there's FinTechs involved, whether it's in point of sale or
student lending in particular. But we're keeping our discipline and making sure we're priced to adequate returns to
support driving up our ROTCE and we feel good about able to get growth and make that balance, as you can see
in our numbers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And I guess, taken together, like as you think about growing loans, it sounds like you're confident that the volume
is enough to offset any margin or pricing pressure going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. On the consumer side, I do, I see us continuing to be able to, sort of, moderately accelerate our pace of
loan growth. And keep in mind that our growth levels now, when you think about the last question around elevated
deposits in an environment where customers are also flush with cash. So, as that starts to draw down, we expect
loan growth to pick up even more as consumers need more leverage, where right now they're sitting on a lot of
cash. So, we feel really good about the medium-term for loan growth prospects.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And then, why don't I add to that on the on the commercial side. As John mentioned, the highlight numbers are
strong, but we're seeing our pipelines on the loan side, not only on the Capital Markets side but on a loan side, up
10%, 15% quarter-on-quarter, and then up another 10%, 15% as we go into the fourth quarter. We're adding new

clients at a very good pace as we benefit from our expansion markets in particular. And we're growing our
commitment book faster than our loan book. So, yeah, as utilization begins to pick up, it'll be picking up off a
larger commitment book. So, that all feels reasonably good as we sit here today.

Hi.

John, can we come back to the swap portfolio? Can you share with us what interest rate environment you will
benefit the most from with the book that you've put on? Meaning, rising short-term rates by 100 basis points or
long-term rates going up by 50 basis points. Can you kind of work through that? And then second – as part of that
question, if you didn't put the swap book on, what would have the asset sensitivity been of your balance sheet
today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean, I'll just hit that with high level. We're more exposed to the short end of the curve than the long end.
So the asset – it's about 60/40 short to long and rising, frankly as we migrate through the cycle. So, the
environment that will work well for us is when the Fed lift off begins. That's an environment that will really drive net
interest margins and NII upward, given the unhedged portion of our C&I book and other floating rate exposures
that we have. So, that still remains our most favorable, sort of, environment that would work well for us.
And to just give you a sense for – with how the math plays out on that, you know what, 25 basis point rise on the
short end drives about $80 million or so of NII for us, if that helps you kind of quantify what were – where the
benefit comes from.
In terms of asset sensitivity, we would be in the low teens, low to mid-teens without continuing to hedge. And it's
not really where our risk appetite is. There's – rates can go up and we hope to continue to do – continue to go up,
but they can go down as well. And so, there's a risk profile there that, over time, we're not only attempting to kind
of preserve our asset sensitivity, but we're also cognizant of the – that there is downside exposure that we're
taking off the table when we dollar-cost average in with the swap book.

Very good. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, John, you gave us some good data on slide 15 on your digital
metrics. And I was curious, when you look at your mobile active users, what percentage of the households are
mobile active users? And then, second, when you look at your digital book sales, great growth year-over-year,
what percentage of your sales are now coming through that digital channel?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Great question. It's Brendan. Yeah, we look at a lot of different metrics on digital. I'd say when we have the
customers primary relationship, the digital active users are incredibly high. It's over 80% of our customer base so,
it's digitally engaged. So, we feel good about that foundation. Our efforts now are moving from just general active
to full service transactional banking done in a much more everyday way on mobile. So, we've got a lot of efforts
underway across the company, which are driving these metrics up, including in the branches and in the call
center, efforts to communicate and nudge our customers to get more engaged with digital.
It's hugely retentive for us with our customers but also, as you know, if we can get them really engaged, we can
pivot the branches more to advice, and there's a cost dynamic here at play that we can then go back and reinvest
in the top of the funnel for customer acquisition growth. So, we feel really good about the trends in mobile, and I
see a lot of upside here looking forward.

Brendan Coughlin A
Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Oh, percentage. I'm sorry. Percentage of digital sales. Yeah, it's rapidly growing and it's very different category by
category. So, some of our lending businesses are principally digital first. And you'll see in things like student, a
75% to 80% rate of digital, whereas in something like DDA and deposits, it's more in the 25% to 30% range, but
growing. Two years ago, it was in the 15% range. So, we're seeing active upticks. The branch channel for basic
deposit products is still the largest source of customer acquisition, but there's some balance coming into play.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Hey, John, on the other side of the rate sensitivity you had previously talked
about wanting to keep the securities book around mid-teens of earning assets and I see that you've added some
securities at period end versus average. Given what we're seeing in the environment, what's your appetite for
continuing to move some of that excess cash into the book? And any change thoughts vis-à-vis what you've
already talked about on swaps in terms of what you want to do and where you want the securities book to go?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I appreciate the question. I think that you may see the securities book rise, but as it relates to a percentage
of total interest earning assets, we're still in that mode of around mid-teens or thereabouts. It could tick up a little
bit. But there's not really any plans for a large change in the percentage of securities to interest-earning assets.
And I think the reason for that is twofold. One is that, given our loan growth opportunity, really that's our
preference is that we would prefer to deploy our excess liquidity into our loan opportunities which from – when
you look at our consumer lending, which is the diversity of that and seeing commercial starting to really lift off a
bit, that's where we want to put that cash.
And so that's what the plan would be in the near term for that to head in that direction. I think the other aspect of it
is that we just have a view that the rate risk hedging, which the securities books can also do double duty on, we
think it's a bit more efficient to do that off balance sheet with swaps. And so, that's still the plan, dollar cost
average over time in that space.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Got it. And John, on NII, in the slide deck, you talked about PPP being a 7 basis point increase sequentially, can
just level set us on how much PPP was in the NII and just what you expected to trail that out of as far as the
program runs down? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I mean, big picture you've got – I mean, I think the way I would talk about that is that, all throughout the
year, we've had a sense that PPP was going to be about the same, first half and second half. And that's playing
out. But there has been a $15 million increase in the third quarter versus the second quarter in PPP contribution
to NII. That $15 million really is coming from the fourth quarter.
So, really, that's really the – how it's all going to play out is that $15 million increase in PPP from 2Q to 3Q, and
then, because of the pull forward from 4Q, a $30 million decrease from 3Q to 4Q on PPP. But I would hasten to
add that ex-PPP, in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we're seeing NII growth ex-PPP. And that's really
good to see. And I think we mentioned that we're up about 2% in terms of 4Q NII ex-PPP. So a lot of that PPP
downdraft is getting offset, given the fact that our guide is really stable to down only slightly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Yeah. Okay.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Ken. I would just add that this has been an issue of great interest for analysts and investors like what's been the
impact of PPP. We always view it as something that was transitory, that eventually these were nice earning
assets for us for 2021. But they would very quickly start to reduce and then they would fall off and that had much
of an impact on 2022.
So, the real key was can we develop enough loan growth to basically substitute core consumer loans in particular
for the PPP loans that are running off. And we think with the spot loan growth we had in Q3 and what we're
expecting in Q4, mission accomplished that we'll be in good position to offset any future impacts as it relates to
the first half and all of 2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Absolutely. And I guess one quick one in. How much, John and Bruce, is still running off from the other retail
because I know you have the Citizens Pay presumably growing in there, but what's weighing against that?
Thanks, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. What's weighing against that is the personal unsecured portfolio that we ran up about two years ago and
then decided it's best when the COVID hit to run that back down and stop new originations. So, that's been a little
bit of a dead weight in the unsecured area, which masks a little bit the nice growth we've had in Citizens Pay and
some of the rebounding that we're seeing in card. Brendan, you may have the exact numbers. So, what's left of
that at this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. It's about a little shy of $900 million left on the personal loan book, and it's about $150 million-ish of a drag
quarter-on-quarter to loan growth. It's one of the other books that's in rundown mode versus [ph] Marine RV

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Also on the loan front, I know on the line utilization you indicated the 50 bps increase and the gradual recovery
expected. Can you just maybe elaborate a little bit more on the areas of expected strength as you see that
rebound in line utilization taking hold? I know you mentioned the subscription finance, M&A and ABL. Is that the
areas where you continue to expect that momentum to build or do you expect that to broaden and if you could
comment on what areas? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll make a few comments and Don will elaborate on that. I mean, I think the areas that we're seeing looking
forward into commercial is, we've seen strength in asset back securitizations that will – we see that continuing.
Subscription line finance, as I mentioned in my remarks, in part due to M&A activity, is an area of continued
growth. CRE is a place where we're seeing some good uptake, maybe in the office space with [ph] built to suit
(38:20) and in the industrial space as well. So, that's starting to contribute now as well.
And then to your point about C&I utilization, I mean, I think two points related to it. So, we're seeing commitments
rising and even if utilization doesn't really lift off that still provides some loan growth, even if utilization levels are
up just a very tiny bit if overall commitments are up then that still creates a positive contribution.
And there's a handful of sectors that are driving that. You've got construction, energy, manufacturing are a couple
of the areas, and it is somewhat broad-based. It's a small increase, but somewhat broad-based number of sectors
where we're seeing small increases in utilization. And maybe just turn it over to Don for any...

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I think the good the good news, John, is that we are seeing in our core middle market and C&I book the
beginnings of a little bit of daylight in terms of utilization. As John said in the opening remarks, clearly, the supply
chain labor issue is restraining the performance of some companies, so they would be performing better than they
even are now if they didn't have some of the supply chain problems. But we, in the last couple of months, we're
beginning to see some core C&I utilization.
The financial capital markets oriented, which is where subscription lines and ABS and the [indiscernible] (39:44)
have been really strong all year, and we expect them to continue to be strong as we get into the fourth quarter
and into next year. So, combination [indiscernible] (39:52)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And then Don, you probably also, you hit on the point, the middle market is where you're seeing that take up on
line utilization, bigger companies, large...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Companies that don't have access to capital markets. So the challenge that we've had on loan growth is
predominantly pay downs because people are going to the capital market...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
The bigger companies.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald H. McCree A
Vice Chairman & Head-Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
...given the strength of the capital markets. So the middle market guys are beginning to see some light at the end
of the [indiscernible] (40:16). Part of it is just CEO confidence, frankly. They really, really, really squeeze down on
their companies. And as they begin to see COVID really begin to wane, they're beginning to grow their companies
a little bit quicker at the margin.

very, very solid deal pipeline there. Can you maybe talk to us about how you're thinking about that line when you
look at 2022 as you're budgeting? And then also, can you remind us how much we should assume that falls to the
bottom line in that business, particularly as the top line momentum really builds? Thanks.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I think we continue to get more and more optimistic about 2022. I was sitting here maybe mid-year saying, wow,
2021 is really a banner year. There's a lot of this that may be keying off potential tax changes both on the M&A
side and on the Capital Markets side. But our pipelines continue to build and we think it's going to be very strong
as we go into next year. I think my general view is you've got an environment where you're going to have a
relatively strong economy, you're going to have relatively low interest rates and you're going to have very high
liquidity, and that's a very, very strong backdrop for 2022.
One of the things that we've got our eye on and we just don't know yet is how much is going to get pulled into
2021, so we're going to have to be rebuilding pipelines maybe in the first quarter to get going. So, you may see a
fourth quarter-first quarter kind of swing, but we'll have to wait till the balance of the year to see that.
And I don't really – I'd say the – I don't know what the marginal contribution is. It's actually lower than the lending
business because the comp payouts are higher, but I don't have that number at the tip of my fingers. And
remember, we pay a lot of different people. We pay bankers. We pay corporate finance people. We pay M&A
people. We pay capital markets people. So, it all blends together. And the way I look at it is our overall efficiency
ratio is actually pretty good and we're ...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
40%, of course.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. So, we got 40% efficiency ratio. It washes out to the bottom line.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. And I would just add too that we see these secular trends. We see private equity pools of capital growing
and looking to put money to work, opportunity to gain some very attractive leverage levels and financing costs are
low. So, those trends will continue. And one of the reasons why we're hell-bent on assembling broader
capabilities, including what we've done with some of the M&A boutique acquisitions and JMP is we want to be an
intermediary in those flows of putting money to work. And if our middle market companies want to sell
themselves, we can take them to market and get a good price.
So, we've got the customer base. We increasingly have the product capabilities. And so, that's reason for
optimism in and of itself. I think we'll continue to gain a lot of synergies as we look out into 2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. And the only thing I'd add to that, Bruce, is with JMP coming on board it's the last piece of the puzzle really.
So, not only do we have full service capabilities to help our clients do whatever they need to do, we've got a nice
diversity in terms of product sets. So, it'll let us benefit when markets are good in the equities or the debt markets
and vice versa.

Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey. Good morning.

Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Hi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Just a couple of quick follow-ups. One, I think, as we look through the deal closings. One, I guess we're still on
track for a 1Q closing for HSBC and Investors. Any risk of a delay there? And remind us as you close those
transactions, are there any aspects of those balance sheets where we could see any runoff that may impact
results as we look pro forma for the deal?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Hey. I'll go ahead and start. Ebrahim, it's John. So, the expectation for HSBC is to close mid-first quarter and
that's very much on track. We're deep into the sort of preparations for that, it's both a close and a conversion on...
[indiscernible] (44:57)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Exactly, we have regulatory approvals in hand on that transaction. So that one is looking just exactly as we
expected. And I think the other larger transaction, which was [indiscernible] (45:12) overall one big strategic
allocation of capital, but ISBC is a separate legal entity that we're – we've got the shareholder vote scheduled for
November 19. And the regulatory approvals are pending on that. The expectation and target for that is that we

receive those approvals sometime in early 2022, and we have an opportunity to close that in 2Q, but
nevertheless, that's pending and we'll keep monitoring it.
As it relates to runoff, we're not expecting to have runoff. Well, I think the way we've described it is that we would
continue those businesses, but the front book sort of activities would have a different profile than the back book in
particular with investors because of all the capabilities that we're bringing to the table. And so we're not expecting
to have us have any meaningful runoff, but we are expecting the loan book to have a different profile a year or two
down the line, given more C&I and more consumer lending that we'll be able to generate off that platform as you
look ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I would just add a couple of points there, John. First off on HSBC, the price is tied to what comes over. So if
there is any runoff, we would have a shock absorber there in terms of what the ultimate premium is that we pay.
And secondly, just when it comes to JMP, we're working very diligently to try to get that closed mid fourth quarter
here. So, we should have four to six weeks in the results here in Q4, which would be accretive of course.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's helpful. And just one separate question. You all spend a lot of time on the payments with Citizen Pay (sic)
[Citizens Pay] (46:58), what you're doing in Buy Now, Pay Later. When you think about Zelle, and you put a stat
about 34% growth in Zelle, is there more that you think – and I understand you don't call the shots in Zelle, but do
you think Zelle should be doing more in terms of enabling banks such as yourself to compete with some of the
tech players in the business, in terms of in-store payments, et cetera?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. It's Brendan. Look, I think, Zelle, the rails that have been built for Zelle are adequate, and I think the
industry, including Citizens, needs to take control of the UI layer that sits above the rails and innovate on our own
around the customer experience, whether it's peer-to-peer payments that's facilitated with Zelle or whether it's
purchasing something direct with a merchant, which would be more a Citizens Pay platform.
So we're making big investments in both of those environments. So, you can you see a world where those
capabilities converge a little bit and it's a similar experience, whether you're buying something from a merchant or
whether you're sending money to a friend. I think that's possible. But I think the rails are adequate. I don't
necessarily think Zelle in particular needs to do anything dramatic to innovate. I think it's more around what we
can do in the UI layer to make things easier for customers to increase engagement. As you can see our numbers,
that's happening and we continue to want to scale that up further and get more customers deeper engaged.

Operator: And for our next question, we will go to the line of Vivek Juneja. Go ahead, please.

Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a clarification, the PPP, so, you've not given numbers and maybe that
might make it easier. But if I look at the 7 basis points, that seems to equate to about $30 million in terms of the
change from 2Q to 3Q. I heard you mentioned $15 million, so I'm trying to understand what am I missing there
when we do that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I mean, as I've said, is it easier to just give the numbers what it was in 2Q and 3Q.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. We did give the numbers that it is a $15 million delta. And the reason that it shows 7 basis points on that is
there's a numerator effect and a denominator effect, Vivek. So, you have loans running off, which affects the
denominator, so it really doubles the impact. You probably have about 3 basis points from the NII pick-up and
then you get three to four for having the loan balances run down and be forgiven.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. That's helpful, Bruce. And the roll-on, roll-off on the securities yields, how is that going? Can you give us
some color where that stands and how much further?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, sure. I mean, so we've had several quarters going back for a while now with securities yield falling. And I
think the dynamic there is not only to the pure front book, back book, which has been negative by about 40 basis

points or so, but also you've got premium amortization which has been a drag. And I think our outlook however is
for that to stabilize and frankly start to turn around in the fourth quarter.
I think in large degree, we will see the pure front book, back book start to narrow, call it, fall to something in the
neighborhood of 30 basis points. But at the same time, we're also seeing as rates rise premium amortization will
also slow and that'll provide a net positive to securities yields in 4Q.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
So, yeah, that's really – we're at about an inflection point there, Vivek. So, with that steeper curve, as John
indicated, front book, back book, when you factor in reduced amortization, we're now going to see that turn to be
a tailwind from being a headwind for the first three quarters of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. If I may, one more. The other retail you've been talking about, Citizens Pay, you've signed up a lot of
partners. Hard to see although because it's overcast by the runoff portfolio, what are you seeing in those loans in
terms of growth that is Citizens Pay related? Is there some numbers that you can give us because, obviously,
the...

It's year-on-year growth.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. The growth in Citizens Pay has been pretty substantial, so all things, kind of, Buy Now, Pay Later is up
around 40% year-over-year with balances and we continue to see that accelerate. We've got a lot of activity in the
back half of this year on bringing on new clients, and it takes a while for these things to ramp. They've got a – we
pilot them, they come online. We work with merchants to bring them to life, to market them to their customers.
So, it's a bit of a ramp-up period and so all the leading activities that need to happen to continue to have
confidence that this can scale through 2022 and beyond are there. So we feel pretty good that it's headed in the
right direction. We're building a lot of new technical capabilities that's broadening out our value proposition within
Citizens Pay as well, so underlying very good healthy growth.

Bruce Winfield van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Sounds like [indiscernible] (52:58) that we could probably shed some light to be a little more transparent in that
unsecured area for future presentation at a conference or in our general releases. So, thanks for the question.
