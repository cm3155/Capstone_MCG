Thank you, Jennifer. Let me join in welcoming you to our first quarter 2023 earnings call. The recent disruption in
the banking sector reminds us of the importance of resiliency to be able to meet the needs of clients in all
operating environments. During the past six weeks, much like over the past 130 years, our strong balance sheet
and conservative approach to risk management have enabled us to provide the support, liquidity and exceptional
service our clients have come to expect from us. Northern Trust continues to be viewed as a source of strength
and stability as symbolized by our anchor. During the quarter, we continue to assist our clients manage their
liquidity, including deposits, money market funds and short-term treasuries through the transition from a period of
quantitative easing and low interest rates to one of rapid tightening and higher rates.
Overall, we saw client liquidity increase during the quarter as the decline in deposits was more than offset by
increases in higher yielding money market funds. Our results for the first quarter reflects sequential improvement
in revenue and expense growth. The sequential growth in trustees outpaced a slight decrease in net interest
income, which still experienced healthy year-over-year growth. Expense growth moderated from recent quarters,
which was attributable to both our renewed spending discipline and certain timing differences.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2023
Within our Wealth Management business, assets under management grew mid-single digits sequentially, while
our trust fees increased modestly. The turmoil in the banking space contributed to a flurry of new business activity
later in the quarter. We saw solid new account openings, particularly at the upper end of the wealth market. We
took in almost $1 billion in inflows from the $50 million in over segment alone and discussions are continuing with
the solid pipeline of prospective clients.
In Asset Management, we had a strong start to the year with the sequential increase in new business, including
large inflows into our institutional money market platform. New product launches focused on alternatives and
extending securities lending capabilities in our collective fund space with three new funds launched.
Within Asset Servicing, we saw continued momentum with particularly good traction in Europe. For example,
during the quarter we transitioned in Artemis Investment Management, a large UK-based investment manager for
whom we are providing a full suite of services, including custody, fund administration, investment operations
outsourcing and risk and analytics services for both their UK and Luxembourg funds.
In closing, we are well-positioned to continue to serve our clients and navigate the ongoing economic uncertainty
from a position of strength. I'll now turn the call over to Jason.

Thank you, Mike. And let me join Jennifer and Mike in welcoming you to our first quarter 2023 earnings call. Let's
dive into the financial results of the quarter starting on page 4. This morning, we reported first quarter net income
of $334.6 million, earnings per share of $1.51, and our return on average common equity was 12.4%. On a year-
over-year basis, currency movements unfavorably impacted our revenue growth by approximately 100 basis
points and favorably impacted our expense growth by approximately 130 basis points. On a sequential basis,
currency movements favorably impacted our revenue growth by approximately 70 basis points and unfavorably
impacted our expense growth by approximately 90 basis points.
Our first quarter results were also impacted by two notable items. One, we recognized a $6.9 million pre-tax gain
on the securities repositioning we announced last quarter and executed in January. We recorded nine – two, we
reported $9.8 million of pre-tax charges associated with various early lease termination, actions taken to further
optimize our global real estate footprint. Notable items from previous periods are listed on the slide.
Excluding the notable items in all periods, revenue was flat on a sequential quarter basis and up 1% over the prior
year. Expenses were flat on a sequential quarter basis and up 6% over the prior year, reflecting an expense to
trust fee ratio of 120%. Pre-tax income was down 2% sequentially and down 13% over the prior year.
Trust investment and other servicing fees, representing the largest component of our revenue, totaled $1 billion
and were down 9% from last year, but up 2% sequentially. Excluding notable items, we had year-over-year and
sequential declines in all other non-interest income, which is primarily driven by lower foreign exchange trading
income. We saw significantly reduced volumes in the first two months of the quarter with a modest pickup in
March.
Net interest income on an FTE basis, which I'll also discuss in more detail in a few moments was $544 million, up
40% from a year ago, down 1% sequentially. Our provision for credit losses was $15 million for the first quarter,
reflecting growth in the size and duration of the commercial real estate loan portfolio. Given the increased

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2023
attention being placed on commercial real estate loans, we want to provide some detail we thought would be of
interest.
Commercial real estate loans comprise 12% of our total portfolio, and commercial office loans comprise 2% of
total loans. Approximately 95% of commercial real estate loans are personally guaranteed, and approximately
70% have a loan-to-value ratio of less than or equal to 70%.
Turning to our Asset Servicing results on page 5. Assets under custody/administration for Asset Servicing clients
were $13 trillion at quarter end, down 9% year-over-year, but up 4% sequentially. Asset Servicing fees totaled
$603 million, which were also down 9% year-over-year, but up 3% sequentially. Custody and fund administration
fees, the largest component of fees in the business were $414 million, down 9% year-over-year but up 2%
sequentially. Custody and fund administration fees decreased from prior year quarter, primarily due to
unfavorable markets and unfavorable currency translation. They increased sequentially due to favorable markets,
favorable currency translation and solid new business activity, particularly later in the quarter.
Transactional activity, which comprises approximately 15% of our custody and fund administration fees was
generally weaker due to lower volumes and lower one-time fees. Assets under management for Asset Servicing
clients were $962 billion, down 12% year-over-year but up 7% sequentially. Investment management fees within
Asset Servicing were $126 million, down 14% year-over-year but up 2% sequentially. Investment management
fees decreased from the prior year quarter, primarily due to asset outflows and unfavorable markets, partially
offset by lower money market fund fee waivers. Investment management fees increased sequentially due to
favorable markets and favorable currency translation.
Moving to our Wealth Management business on page 6. Assets under management for our Wealth Management
clients were $368 billion at quarter-end, down 7% year-over-year but up 5% on a sequential basis. Trust,
investment and other servicing fees were $461 million, down 9% compared to the prior year, but up 1%
sequentially. Within both the regions and GFO, the year-over-year declines were primarily driven by unfavorable
market impacts and product level asset outflows, partially offset by the elimination of money market fund fee
waivers.
Sequentially, the increase within the regions in GFO was primarily driven by favorable markets, partially offset by
product level asset outflows. The upturn we saw in our AUM occurred later in the quarter, was not fully reflected in
our trust fees. Importantly, we continue to see modest organic growth in our core advisory fees.
Moving to page 7 on our balance sheet and NII trends. Given the attention being placed on balance sheet trends,
we also thought you might be interested in some additional data points this quarter. We think about client liquidity
in three categories: deposits, money market funds and short-term treasuries. With that background, we can
provide some color and data on what we saw throughout the quarter and through the first few weeks of April.
Most importantly, client liquidity was up meaningfully for the quarter in both Asset Servicing and Wealth
Management and it's continued to rise during the first three weeks of April. While we saw a decline in deposits for
the quarter, it was more than offset by increases in money market funds as clients continue to migrate into higher
yielding products. Relative to the fourth quarter, our money market funds are up $15 billion or 7%.
As mentioned, average deposits were $112 billion, down 4% sequentially, with wealth management deposits
down 7% and institutional down 3%. Approximately three quarters of our average deposits are institutional. Within
this segment, approximately 68% are considered operational, the stickiest, as clients use these funds to run their

ongoing operations. Across the organization, we experienced a $2 billion decline in noninterest-bearing deposits
as client shifted to higher yielding alternatives. This reduced the mix of noninterest-bearing deposits to 18%.
We actively manage our assets and liabilities considering a wide range of possible stress scenarios, including
interest rate risks and how they may affect liquidity and capital. So let's shift to the asset side of the balance sheet
to see how investments are allocated. Average cash held at the Fed and other central banks was up 12% to $37
billion and we had $67 billion of immediately available liquidity, reflecting approximately 50% of average earning
assets. Loan balances averaged $42 billion and were down 1% sequentially. Our loan portfolio is well-diversified
across geographies, operating segments, and loan types. Approximately 75% of the portfolio is floating and the
overall duration is less than one year.
Securities were down 3% sequentially, reflecting the impact of both our repositioning early in the quarter and the
natural runoff, which we've chosen to reinvest at the short end of the curve. Our $49 billion investment portfolio
consists largely of highly liquid US Treasury, agency, and sovereign wealth fund bonds, and is split 50/50
between available for sale and held to maturity. In the aggregate, the securities portfolio has a duration of 2.3
years. The total balance sheet duration is 1.1 year.
Net interest income was $544 million for the quarter, up 40% from the prior year and down 1% sequentially. NII
reflected the impact of several dynamics, many occurring late in the quarter. As mentioned, we saw continued
improvement in deposits from our balance sheet to money market funds and treasuries. Deposit costs increased
with our interest-bearing deposit beta during the quarter at 85%, and our cumulative beta for the cycle as of
March 31 of 65%. And finally, we had the impact from two fewer days in the quarter.
Net interest margin was 1.62% in the quarter, up 57 basis points from a year ago and roughly flat with the prior
quarter. The sequential results reflect the impact of higher short-term market rates, offset by higher funding costs.
The prior-year increase is primarily due to higher average interest rates.
For the second quarter, our NII will continue to be driven by client demand, which is less predictable than it was
90 days ago. Our average client deposits thus far in the quarter are approximately $110 billion, and subsequent to
tax season, we've observed an incremental typical decline of a few billion dollars.
Turning to page 8, as reported, noninterest expenses were $1.3 billion in the first quarter, 7% higher than the prior
year, but 3% lower sequentially. Excluding charges in both periods, as noted on the slide, expenses in the first
quarter were up 6% year-over-year but flat sequentially. Overall, we're focused on reducing the rate of expense
growth and controlling those costs that are most under our control.
I'll hit on just a few highlights. Compensation and technology expense continue to be the areas of highest spend.
Compensation expense, excluding charges, was up 6% compared to the prior year and up 7% sequentially. The
year-over-year growth largely reflects the annualization of last year's head count expansion and inflationary wage
pressure, partially offset by lower incentives. The sequential increase is due to our annual payment of retirement
eligible equity incentives in the first quarter.
Equipment and software, largely reflecting our technology spend, was up 20% year-over-year, but up 1%
sequentially. More than 50% of our spend is comprised of business driven investment, followed by spending on
core infrastructure and modernization, and to a lesser extent, spending on information security, risk and
regulatory areas.

Turning to page 9, our capital ratios improved in the quarter and continued to be well above our required
regulatory minimum. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio under the standardized approach was up 50 basis points
from the prior quarter to 11.3%, despite resuming common stock repurchases. This reflects a 430 basis point
buffer above our regulatory requirements.
As a reminder, as a Category II institution under the Federal Reserve's framework, we already include unrealized
losses on our available for sale securities in this calculation. Thus, mark-to-market losses occur immediately in
our capital and capital ratios. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 7.3%, up 20 basis points from the prior quarter. Higher
net income, improved accumulated other comprehensive income, the securities repositioning and lower loan
balances were the primary factors in this quarter's increase in capital ratios.
We returned $259 million to common shareholders in the quarter through cash dividends of $159 million. And
after pausing meaningful share buybacks for the prior five quarters, we repurchased over $100 million of common
stock.
And with that, Cynthia, please open the line for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan
Stanley. Please go ahead.

Hi, Betsy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Really great quarter. Thanks for all the detail and the incremental information here. I did just want to understand
how you're thinking about managing the balance sheet in an environment where deposits are under pressure,
even though it might be modest. I think you indicated that average deposits Q-to-date is around $110 billion and
that's down around 3% from last quarter I believe. So just wanted to understand how you're thinking about that.
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. The most important thing and you referenced it is that it's just – it's an uncertain environment. And although
we've got – we've over $50 billion and what we refer to is economic liquidity, which is the cash we have on hand
at the Fed here and Central Banks around the world and also the short term securities we have. So that provides
a ton of liquidity but the environment is just uncertain and so on – in some ways, we want to just maintain as
much liquidity as possible and not be greedy.

And on the other side, the balance sheet is always available for clients and we – particularly from a liquidity
perspective. And that means we want to leave plenty of room for clients that either want to deposit with us or also
might need lending from us. And so these uncertain times just call for maximum patience for us and maximum
flexibility so that we can be available for whatever our clients want.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And just as a follow up to that, could you help us understand how you're thinking about the loan book going
forward? Because to the extent there is demand, it seems like you've got a decent amount of capacity there.
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. Yeah, you're right, there's a – as you think about this, effectively the securities book at $50 billion act as the
ultimate fulfillment of – and completion mechanism in the balance sheet. We couldn't do all of that with loans, but
we certainly have capacity to do a lot more. But it's always going to start from our perspective with maintaining
prudent credit, quality and approach and then working – the best thing we can do is work with existing clients on
existing types of loans. And so that's why a couple of years ago, you heard us talk about an initiative to do more
lending. We did that. That was very largely with existing clients.
From here forward, we're not looking to have any initiatives to dramatically increase the loan book. It's – from our
perspective, it's responding to clients as they need in different categories. And that the turmoil that we're looking
at, it does provide opportunities. If you look at the, if you look internally at the opportunities that we have, there's a
lot of opportunity. And so we have to be thoughtful about how to grow and with what clients or prospects we want
to grow, but this is a period where there are opportunities out there.

Hi, guys. Good morning. Good morning and thank you for the question. So, I was hoping we could start with
opportunities you guys are seeing in the wealth channel on the back of the dislocation in the banking space. Mike,
you mentioned obviously a flurry of activity towards the end of the quarter. So maybe help us frame what that

means in terms of maybe revenues and I guess zooming out a little bit, what has been happening and I guess
continues to happen in the banking world. Does that increase your kind of organic growth prospects and to what
extent in the wealth channel?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure, Alex. So as I did mentioned, there has been a lot of activity and as we've talked about before, when there's
more money in motion, we do have the opportunity to grow a little bit faster. And so we did see that pick up in the
first quarter after the back half of last year, we talked about the fact that there was less activity as a result of the
interest rate environment. That said, this is something where the nature of the clients that we serve and that we
work with and that we look to bring on board are pretty meaningful and so it's a longer term process. And I would
say business building process than what I would call a sales process to do that. I mentioned some of the
momentum that we saw in the upper part of the market above $50 million and the fact that we have a lot of
prospects in that area as well. So we see this more, as I would say, a longer running opportunity rather than a one
quarter, two quarter opportunity and that's how we're approaching it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. Great. And then my follow-up just around deposits and talk about this comment. Thanks again for the extra
detail. So $110 billion average so far in April and it sounds like maybe down a little bit more on the back of the tax
season where things are standing now. What's the mix, I guess between interest bearing and non-interest bearing
balances in the way you guys see it right now in April? And when it comes to the wealth deposits in particular,
sounds like they were down a little bit more the institutional in the quarter. So I guess as you think about and
rolling forward, what's the approach to the rate you guys are paying on wealth deposits from here since it seems
like a lot of it is ultimately still sorting into money market funds?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So let me give you a couple of incremental data points to work with. One, you're right, we – and it's typical,
obviously, as you know well, Alex, for us to see a drop after the peak of tax season. And so it has come down a
few – in the range of $4 billion or $5 billion since that average relative to that average. And that said, we from a
mix perspective, not seeing anything dramatically different early on. And we talked about the fact that the non-
interest-bearing mix is higher than even it was last time rates were up but as rates flatten out, probably less
incremental shift from that mix.
And then within wealth in particular, the – Mike mentioned the growth there and you're exactly right in calling out a
lot of it go to cash and I mentioned that there's a lift overall in client liquidity, so of the lift that we've seen in cash
and in cash, about $5 billion of that was in the wealth channel alone over the quarter. And so – and that more
than offsets the deposit decline that we saw in that channel. And so you just get a sense that the flows in that
business are positive and give us a sense that there's good activity there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got you. Sorry, and just what's the rate on the wealth deposit that you guys are paying right now?

It's highly dependent. It varies by size, by region, by type. And so it's hard to give a – it's impossible to give a
specific number on it. But if you look at the – what might be instructive as you're thinking about is more of an
overall average cost across the book, which is call it 200 basis points to 250 basis points, 200 basis points to 250
basis points.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
And Alex, I would just add that there's no question with whatever – with everything that's happened here that the
market for deposits is more competitive. So there's more price competition with lots of banks looking to retain or
gain deposits and pricing aggressively to do that. Of course, we have to likewise price to make them attractive for
our clients. But at a certain point, if it's just going to get priced away, on price as opposed to relationships, then
you're going to see some go away.
And just more broadly on deposits, it's just – I think important to understand the nature of our client base, which
you know well, but just asset owners, asset managers, wealth clients that have different characteristics than a lot
of other institutions. Certainly on the operational side, these are deposits that they have as a part of running their
operations. And so, very sticky in the sense that it's based on transaction flows rather than necessarily rate per
se.
And on the other hand, these are institutions that are evaluated based on their performance. And so, when rates
go up as fast as they have here, they have to make sure they're earning returns overall. So they're looking to be
efficient. And with our wealth clients as well we're working with them to make sure that they get attractive returns
overall. So a lot of dynamics at play and I think it's important to understand the characteristics of our client base
relative to others.

Good morning.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
...wanted to start off with a question on the non-comps. Looking at the component pieces, you guys made some
good progress there. A good amount of the beat was really in outside services. I know that that has a heavy
variable or activity linked component. Should we expect that to normalize as activity levels pick up consistent with
what you saw at the end of March? Just trying to think about what's a reasonable jumping off point for us to be
modeling for next quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Absolutely. You're right. And that that line item can move around a lot. So let me give you a short-term and
then maybe a longer term dynamic. In the short run, that line item was impacted by, call it, two things, one, some
timing. So we know that there some of that improvement will likely come back online in second quarter. And then
secondly, we've taken expense actions in that category.
And so we've worked really hard and – to work down consulting, to work down other tech services, sub-custody,
negotiating hard on third-party advisory fees. And so some of it definitely is related to the expense measures that
we talked about broadly related to the Productivity Office. But there's also some timing there too. And so, as you
think about the second quarter, this is an area where you'll see a meaningful increase. Call it $20 million just
quarter-over-quarter going into next year, about $5 million of that is just a movement from on-premise processing
that would show up in equipment and software moving up into outside services. But there's also just business
growth and timing related there as well. We're obviously not going to see $20 million less consistently, but that's
one where we're likely to see one go into second quarter.

Got it. And then just for my follow-up on NII. I know you had alluded to this in some of your commentary and I'll
also echo, I appreciate the additional detail on the deposit side. There's been some debate previously as to
whether NII or NIM had peaked at this juncture whether it could eclipse levels seen last cycle. I was hoping you
could give some perspective just on the NII trajectory if it's peaked at this juncture or if there's room for growth.
And given the balance sheet repositioning you alluded to in terms of shortening the duration on the asset side,
how we should think about the NII trajectory in a Fed easing cycle in particular, would be really helpful?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So on the first, the reality is even this quarter, you could see there was a new factor introduced into NII,
which is just client preference. And you can see just how often – even this morning on this call, we don't talk about
just deposits in isolation. We talk about them in conjunction with money market funds. And a part of that is that
just culturally, we have an incredibly strong focus just on providing advice to clients across whatever is
appropriate for them. And there are advantages to being in deposits. There are advantages to being in money
market funds, there are advantages to being in short term treasuries. And we think about that. We tracked inside
the company. That's what we were looking at very, very closely on a very periodic – on a very frequent, periodic

basis. And so I think that's important for people to understand. We're not nudging clients in one direction or the
other, just talking to them about the advantages of each.
And so the reality is from here, NII is going to be based on more than on interest rates, it's going to be based on
volumes. And volumes, last quarter, we were talking about the impact of QT and we were talking about taxes.
Now this new factor that's been introduced is what is client preference between those three pillars of client
liquidity. And we could see that going in either direction. And for us, that's totally fine as long as we're continuing
to grow client liquidity. And so it's hard to model in the short run but if we think about the traditional factors, Fed
rate increases, the institutional business, which is call it 70% to 80% of our deposits, we're at about 100% beta
there. And that's kind of flattened out.
In the wealth channel, the betas are meaningfully lower. They're call it 30% to 40%. And so still with Fed action,
that's all impacted in US dollars. There's benefit from that lift still. And then you've got to introduce the other
factors, what happens with QT and then what happens with client preference across the pillars. And then from a
NIM perspective, just the last comment I'll make is that we – you saw our leverage ratio is strong, and it's in the
mid-7s and it gives us an opportunity, if we want, to take advantage, if there's a positive carry to do more
leveraging and still maintain great liquidity for our clients. That's helpful to NII, but it's obviously – it brings down
NIM.

Mike Mayo Q

Hi. Well, you mentioned taking tougher actions on expenses. I think that showed quarter-over-quarter. You
mentioned benefits from the industry dislocation, but your expense-to-fee ratio is still above your 105% to 110%
range, quite a bit above. So when do you think you'll get there and should we look at the quarter-over-quarter
progression or should we think about year-over-year because quarter-over-quarter looks better than year-over-
year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Mike, I would say that our perspective is the same in the sense of we're looking, I'll call it sequentially and
quarter-over-quarter and looking to make improvement in that and getting there both on the numerator and
denominator. So holding tight and trying to reduce where we can on the expense side and then growing the fee

side as we go through there. And as you've seen, if you look at it sequentially there, we kind of bottomed out with
the fees in the fourth quarter and now they're up very, very slightly. But then, depending on markets, but then
more importantly, how we drive organic growth underneath that, we're looking to increase fees as we go forward
on a sequential basis, while at the same time, having the discipline on the expense side to keep bringing that
expense to trust fee ratio down.

Good morning, Glenn.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. A question on the other borrowing side, I think most of that is wholesale funding, and I know it's
not a huge number, but it's also grown to be not nothing. It's up 43% and the rate paid on that is up 450 basis
points. So I'm just looking for, is that a temporary filling of the gap of the gap down in deposits? How do you think
about that line item intermediate term say? I know you got to do what you got to do in the short-term.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Part of it is the higher borrowing. Part of it is – is doing more in the – I think part of the reason is that the
cost of that is elevated is the FICC – is us doing more FICC repo for clients and just providing more liquidity
options for them. And the way the accounting works for that with the netting, it just leads to a – it makes it look like
a higher cost than what it is. And so we're going to talk about whether maybe even to break that out separately
and provide more detail in the future on it because it's becoming – to your exact point, it's just becoming a little bit
larger, but that's the reason you see that movement in the short run.

Glenn Schorr Q

Glenn Schorr Q

Okay. And then maybe big picture, you talked about capturing client liquidity, and you talk about it more
holistically than you have in the past as money trends to money markets and treasuries. How much of it is it
advice versus clients just self-selecting in? And are there things that you could – that you're tracking to see what
you're actually capturing? In other words, is it actually your dollars from deposits going into your money market
funds as opposed to pluses and minuses come from different directions?

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2023
Yeah, sure. So a couple of thoughts. One, it's – we're much more accurate in being able to track the money
market fund than we are treasuries. And let me just give an example or two to illustrate why that's the case. We
could and we actually did have a small number of very large institutional clients that might say – might have said a
quarter ago, we'd just like to park some money on the balance sheet. We'd work with them on what rate that is.
And then they might say, for a variety of reasons, we want to go to short-term treasuries. If they do that, they
might use – if it's a financial services fund, it could be a hedge fund. It could be an asset manager. If they have a
prime broker, they're more likely to use their prime broker to manage that. Is that really us – it's certainly not us
losing a lot of net interest income because the pricing on the deposit is going to be really tight, but difficult for us
to track and really confirm where that's going.
The other end of the spectrum is, in wealth management, financial advisors are literally calling their clients and
saying, rates are higher. You're sitting on $750,000 in cash. Let's talk about what you'd like to do with that. Would
you like to move that into a money market fund? Would you like to move it into a CD? Would you like to start
building out in letter a Treasury portfolio? We can track that much more accurately. And so different components,
but in general we're – the statistics that we gave are biased toward the information that we can track and that we
know stayed in-house. And so if there's an information bias, it's toward us ensuring that the numbers we're telling
you are reflective of what stayed here.

Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Maybe just staying on the – for my first question, just to stay on the deposit trends. And the
question would be, as you think about that deposit pricing strategy in the wealth channel specifically, how do you
view raising those deposit rates versus the alternatives? I guess at what point would you be inclined to just let the
deposits go into the money funds or into the letters or rather you would raise rates incrementally to sort of keep
those deposit – wealth deposits on the balance sheet?

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2023
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So the – in each of the businesses, there are pricing groups that's had an overall rate, but there are also
leaders within the regions and then down to relationship managers that have the ability to work at individual client
levels to do what's right. And so we're always thinking about what is our overall pricing relative to peers by
geographical region within wealth management even. But then, there are times when there are very large clients
that might come with $50 million, $100 million, $250 million. And that's obviously not going to be priced off of a
rate sheet. We're going to talk about that.
And the overall bias from we're having conversations with clients again when we're talking about what to do and if
they're going to keep a deposit looking at us versus competition, they just keep it on our platform. And so even
though we've thrown out the beta in that 30% to 40% range, and that may seem light, it's – we're looking at where
the market is, and making sure that the balance sheet, again is available and making sure that we're not
cannibalizing the whole base of deposits in order to pick up some volume. But obviously, and we've talked about it
from the beginning, our strategic bias in wealth for deposits is keep the business on our platform.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Right, that's great color. And then maybe just going back to maybe an early comment that you made, Mike on the
taking up of business, given the banking stress that we've seen in March, I think you mentioned $1 billion of
inflows on the wealth platform, but that it was a longer term dynamic. Maybe if you could just sort of describe what
you're seeing internally in terms of I guess thinking about, I guess maybe the panic environment where clients
were moving assets quickly going to a strong provider like Northern or are we sort of past that phase? And then
what is that next phase of getting those clients because of the dislocation, I guess, what's the sort of the – either
the sales pitch in – as we move to the next couple of quarters in that dynamic?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So Brian, I would start by saying that the way you characterized the first phase, kind of the panic phase is
although we did have, call it like a strong week of inflows around that time period, it really wasn't a panic
environment where people were pushing deposits over the counter so to speak. I think there were different
dynamics at play relative to other time periods. And that's why I say what we're seeing is more kind of the longer
play out in this of, I'll say, clients and prospects thinking about who their long term financial partner is and
ensuring that it's somebody that they're comfortable is going to be there and has the strength and stability.
And so that's why I say it's less of a blip and more of a long term, I'll call it trend is the way that we would see it.
And for us, without a doubt, it is playing off of our brand. It's playing off of the 130-year history of being around
and being a strong partner. That, as you know, has been consistent for a long time. In certain environments, it
plays better than others. We think this is an environment going forward where it plays very well.

Operator: We will take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.

Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Hey, Ken.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, everyone. Thanks. Coming back on the expense question. I know you talked about moving the trust fees
ratios positive from here. The 6% adjusted cost growth rate is the best we've seen in like six or seven quarters
and I'm just wondering just philosophically, are you thinking about managing more towards absolute levels of
costs? And is there a way to help us think about like how you're thinking – I know it's tough to generate operating
leverage in this type of environment, just given what's happened, and what you've walked through. But what's the
right way to just think about absolute cost growth, and how you're managing that on its own in this environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure, it's good to take a step back on this, because it is how we've been talking about it internally recently. And
one way to frame this kind of – is if you think ex-charges, I'm going to – because that's just the way we – we're not
ignoring the charges, but the way we talk about them internally ex-charges, we had 9% expense growth last year.
And then we don't – that's not acceptable for us. And we – so we've got to bend that curve aggressively.
We know we're carrying part of that forward with what we know about the impact of hiring and merit increase and
off-cycle adjustments, given the labor environment last year. But that said, we're targeting getting two points out of
last year's growth rate for the full year 2023. And in general, all the expense areas are going to be addressed
collectively to get to that 7% or better expense growth rate.
And so, we'll look at a couple that are notable, because they've got big movements to them. One, we'll look at
comp and that looked good for first quarter. You look in the second quarter, we know there's about $40 million
coming out because of the seasonality of the retirement eligible grants and some other dynamics there. But we
also know we've got $20 million in merit coming on line in second quarter. Now the incentive accrual is also in that
line, so – and that varies with profitability. And then from there, everything else is going to be driven by what
happens in business from hiring and other actions and expense measures and things like that.
And then we talked about outside services and how that's got a big step up next quarter and then maybe the last
one I'll highlight equipment software, even though we've got that move from equipment software into outside
services, we can – we've got clear visibility on some incremental depreciation coming on line, maybe not in
second quarter, but in third. And so you could see a $5 million step up in that line item in second quarter, but then
we know we've got $10 million in depreciation coming in third quarter. So those are the big pieces at a super high
level and then as well, a couple of the big moves underneath it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
That's super helpful. And within that 7% or better, do you have it, is there an embedded impact on what current

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2023
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
No, not from here. I mean, we know we had a lift in this quarter, just an elevation of lift on both revenue expense,
so it hurt on the expense side, but not really modeling significant change from here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And if I could ask one more time to bring-it-all-together question, you talked about a lot of the balance sheet
changes happening towards the end of the quarter, you talked about where deposits are. We can see where the
betas went to. But do you have a way to help us understand just what the range of expectations of what you think
NII can do in 2Q versus 1Q to help us put that all together?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
We've given a lot of information. I would – we hope to give you a really good answer on this one. But I think we
got to leave it with where the deposit levels are, where the balances have been, where the deposit levels are, and
then look from there on. There's just so many factors moving around and particularly just client preference. And
we're being so emphatic in saying we're not going to try to nudge in any direction, just provide good advice there.
So it's hard to bind it.
I have to say, the big factors that we see from here with volumes being down so far, I'm hard-pressed to see how
we match the $544 million of second quarter. And so I'm going to say down, but not do too much more than that
to give in anticipation just given the volatility in the market about client preference and where deposits are going.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2023
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah, it was good, and there's no reason we can't continue to be in the market. There are a couple of things
working in our favor. One, if we've got good return on equity and this – it's something like we picked up 35 basis
points, 40 basis points from net income. You give up maybe half of that in dividends, but we also know that we're
getting a lift from – over time, the AOCI is going to pull to par and that gives a lift. I think it's also noteworthy the
balance sheet repositioning we did, it was – that was accretive to CET1 because it helped reduce RWA.
And so those things helped. And so, if you think about those dynamics of what is return on equity, where are we
from a dividend payout ratio perspective and then the pull in the par of AOCI in general, it gives us some room to
buy back stock while at the same time increasing CET1 to be at levels that are more consistent with, if you look at
our long term history, we're still a little bit lower than where we were. And you know we're always looking at where
our peers and where is the competition and making sure we have good buffers, but that's how we're thinking
about it nowadays. I'll tell you, we do look – every day, we know the impact of rates on AOCI. And so, that's a
factor you should imagine we're thinking about intra quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Okay, that's fair. And then maybe, just maybe a bigger picture, we've talked a lot about NII on the fee side. You
had good flows at the end of the quarter into money market funds, which is one of your higher fee rate products.
You're talking about perhaps increased flows in the wealth side. How do we think – and you had a move in the
markets, how do we think about total fee income, any puts and takes to think about as we go forward into the next
quarter and beyond?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. We talked about the – we get good sense of where we are at the end of the quarter relative to the
averages. And so it gives us a – the launch point frankly is positive relative to where we are. And you're right that
the money market funds in general, that's an attractive fee business for us. And so those – all those things play in
our favor, but we also know markets have a really big impact and is – and then also as much as we talk about, we
talk about organic growth in the business, what happens with the markets in the short run is often the bigger
driver.
The last thing I'll mention is that in Asset Servicing, in particular, that pipeline in the short run of one not funded,
one not onboarded is still above historical levels. And so the short run looks positive. We have less visibility out
late in the year, but the Asset Servicing side, still is also attractive relative to history and we gave you even more
information I think on the Wealth Management side of the business.

Brennan Hawken Q

Good morning. Yeah, good morning, Jason. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to try and make sure I
understand something on expenses. You had spoken to getting below 7% expense growth and I believe that was
on a number that was ex one-timers. Do I understand that right? And what is that base on 2022 if we back out the
one-timers just so I can kind of fully level set and understand how we'd be really thinking about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
So one more just clarifying, you had chatted about how there's some noise in that other financing line that we'd
most usually think about as wholesale. So with deposits coming down, would think that you'd be probably building
out the wholesale, at least in the near term given the quarter-to-date decline in the balances. Is that operating
assumption fair? And then if we were to strip out some of that FICC financing line, what is that core cost to your
wholesale, just so we can model it appropriately when we're thinking about truing up for the some of the quarter-
to-date trends you flagged? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. And in general, it's going to depend on where we go in the market and how we – and what sources of
wholesale funding that we use and so it's FHLB and sometimes we're doing other sources. But in general, it's
been in the mid-4s this past quarter and going forward I think it's just – think, it's obviously going to be impacted
by rates and where and what happens with the Fed. And so – but I think the fact that we've gotten two questions
this time, means, we'll probably in the future try and give you guys a little bit more information on the impact of
FICC repo and how that's impacting the borrowing costs. And there's also impact on the asset side, to be fair as
well. So we'll provide some more information on it.

Right. Thanks. That'd be really helpful. I would love to just do – and this is a little bit of a ticky-tacky, but I'd love to
just do one more on expenses, if you don't mind. You spoke to $20 million pickup quarter-to-quarter. It seemed
like our non-comp but $5 million of that was just like going from one bucket to another. So does that mean it's like
$15 million quarter-over-quarter or does that mean that $20 million is the total step up we should think about for
non-comp? And then underneath the surface of that, there's $5 million moving from one bucket to another? Just if
you could clarify that, that'd be helpful.

Yeah. I'm going to – there's a couple areas where I mentioned 5s and 10s. So let me – I'm going to be a little bit
repetitive, forgive me, but it'll make sure that I was 100% clear on them because there's a couple different areas
that you might have been referencing.
On comp, no movements between buckets. We're thinking – take the first quarter, reduce it by $40 million for the
retirement eligible and some other factors that play into the incentive line and then add $20 million for merit
increase. That gives you a decent starting point to say, okay, what's going to happen with the business going
forward?
The second dynamic that I'd mentioned does have movement between line items. It's movement between outside
services and equipment and software, and there's about a $5 million move that's going to happen in the second
quarter from equipment and software into outside services. Outside services should be about $20 million higher
than first quarter. That $20 million includes the $5 million from equipment and software. On equipment software,
still think that that line item is going to be up a few million dollars in second quarter.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2023
Thomas Leddy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Circling back a bit on the fee side and following up a bit on Alex's question earlier, can you give us some color on
the competitive landscape you saw this quarter and any organic growth opportunities you see as we look further
into 2023? On the institutional side, you guys gave some good color on the wealth side, but just on the
institutional side, any additional color there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Hey. Tom, the additional card give you there is that certainly highly competitive, but there are quite a few
opportunities that are out there. So active market and I would say a lot of what's driving it is with the impact on the
markets last year, equity markets being down 19%, 20%, that put a lot of pressure on asset managers and as a
result, having them look at their operating models, how they can become more efficient and looking to either
outsource activities and/or consolidate providers. And so that has increased, again, the level of opportunities in
the marketplace and can cut both ways. I mean, situations where they were advantaged, but other situations
where I'll say were more on the defensive because it's an existing client or one of two being an existing client, so
very active at this point and obviously trying to win more than our share.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Leddy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you. That's helpful. And then just lastly, a high level. Can you detail for us what an ideal environment would
look like for you guys in terms of an interest rate and global markets perspective?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. It's interesting. I think Gerard actually might have asked that exact question a few weeks ago, which seems
like quarters ago. And my thought on that is that it's, first of all, the trajectory, the slope of the curve matters a ton.
And having a somewhat steeper yield curve matters a lot.
And secondly, you want rates to be above very low, and so when rates are, if you call it 50 basis points – when
Fed funds rates are below 50 basis points or below, it's just hard for us to get good return on equity and we start
to play in the fee waiver land, which just is not – it's not that we lose money in money market funds, but that whole
business, the economics of it change a lot.
But then lastly, the pace with which you get to any environment matters a lot and that's why a lot of banks have
struggled this time. It's not the yield curve, it's the pace of change. And literally 12 months ago to today and the
Fed moving this aggressively in a relatively short period of time, it just creates a, it's very tough to deal with pace.
So, those are the three dynamics that are forefront of mind from our lens.

Thomas Leddy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. Thank you. That's helpful. And thank you guys for taking the questions.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2023
Operator: We will our next question from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Hi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi, Jason. Hi, Mike. A couple of questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Hi, Vivek.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
One is the head count cuts – the severance that you'd took in the fourth quarter. Have we seen that flow through
yet in terms of the numbers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
So we have actually gotten a pretty good head start on those, but very little impact already in the numbers. That
happened later in the quarter. And there's – the areas of the business where they happened, we just haven't seen
them play through very much yet, some impact but light.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
So should we – in those numbers that you gave us, should there be some benefit from that coming through,
Jason, in Q2 or not at or 3Q or any color on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. All along, I think we said we think the meaningful impact should be visible by third quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2023
And, again, remember also that when we said this is about getting jobs into the right places and so in many
instances, this is about transitioning jobs from lower cost – from higher cost locations to lower cost locations. And
so we'll see some benefit, but it's not the impact of taking the roles that we're exiting times the average cost.
There's some exit in some instances. And again, I think it's super instructive to focus on what we mentioned
earlier. We're thinking about the – our target is to try and get that overall expense growth rate into the right level.
And we're thinking about all of these different expense categories in aggregate to get there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Okay. Shifting gears, completely different one. You talked about the [ph] reverse sweep (01:05:00) I want
to separate from that. Your other borrowings went up from about $3.5 billion a year ago, $8 billion last quarter to
now over $11 billion. It doesn't seem like you're making much of a spread on that. Any color on how we should
think about that and what's driving that increase?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. That's also where the FICC repo activity is going to be reflected. But...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I see. Not just in the repo line, but on top of that in the other borrowings line too, is it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
I think in the other borrowings, Vivek, you also have some of the Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, which
during this time period we term some of those out, which previously was more, all overnight and just in this time
period with the uncertainty, wanted to add additional liquidity to the balance sheet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. And there was about $3.5 billion in that increased FHLB line item.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
That's...
[indiscernible] (01:06:14)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Northern Trust Corp.
That's sequentially, not year-over-year.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 25-Apr-2023
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Right. Right. And you're done with that, Mike or are you still looking to leave some – do more there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
No, we'll – as opportunities come up for us, we're still contemplating it. Not necessarily, done. I mean, as you
know, the spread's not – it's not extremely high there. So there's a combination of liquidity management, but also,
the spread that's available. But you know what, moving that from $7.6 billion to $11.4 billion is a big move.
There's also one other dynamic in that line item, which is that, there was some euro investment leveraging the
had been up in the non-US office interest-bearing line that has been re-classed into other borrowing. And so that's
a little over $1 billion. And so it's just another dynamic to the increase that you see there. But back to – we've got
capacity for leveraging and we'll continue to think about where to use it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Great. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
