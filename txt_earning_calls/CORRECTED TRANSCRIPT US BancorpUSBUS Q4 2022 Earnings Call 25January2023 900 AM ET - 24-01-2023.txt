Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, George. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin on slide 3.
This quarter, we completed the acquisition of MUFG Union Bank on December. In the fourth quarter, we reported
$0.57 per diluted share or $1.20 after adjusting for notable items related to the acquisition. This was a complex
quarter that included one month of Union Bank results, merger integration charges and balance sheet
optimization activity. Terry will provide more details on these notable items. Importantly, we ended the year with a
common equity Tier 1 ratio of 8.4%, which was just above our expected level at deal close and we delivered
positive operating leverage for U.S. Bancorp legacy operations of 230 basis points for the full-year. Strong year-
over-year pre-tax provision income growth, as adjusted for notable items, was driven by net interest income
growth and positive operating leverage. Credit quality remained strong, although credit metrics are starting to
normalize as expected.
Slide 4 details are reported and adjusted income statement results as well as end-of-period balances and other
performance metrics. End-of-period assets for the company totaled $675 billion, reflecting the acquisition of Union
Bank and certain balance sheet optimization actions.
Slide 5 highlights key performance ratios. This quarter, we delivered a return on average assets of 1.2%, a return
of average common equity of 16.8%, and a return on tangible common equity of 23.4%, each as adjusted for
notable items.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
Turning to slide 6, the completion of the Union Bank acquisition marked a significant milestone for our company.
With double-digit percent increases in loan and deposit balances, Union Bank adds meaningful scale to our
business that enables us to better serve our customers and communities. Union contributes considerable small
business and consumer market share in a demographically attractive California market and we're excited about
the potential to deepen existing Union Bank relationships by overlaying our leading digital capabilities and robust
product set, including Wealth Management, Consumer and Business Banking and Payments offerings across a
loyal but underpenetrated consumer base. In many ways, this deal underscores our commitment to creating a
stronger, more competitive regional banking organization in a rapidly evolving environment. One of the more
attractive aspects of this transaction is Union Bank's high-quality, low-cost consumer deposit franchise, which will
support continued loan growth and margins.
Let me turn the call over now to Terry, who will provide more detail on the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Andy. If you turn to slide 7, as Andy mentioned, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.57 for the
quarter or $1.20 per share after adjusting for notable items related to the acquisition. Notable items related to
Union Bank acquisition are comprised of three primary elements that reduced earnings per share by $0.63 related
to balance sheet optimization, merger and integration costs, and the impacts on provision expense related to
acquired loans and actions taken to optimize the balance sheet. During the fourth quarter, the company
recognized a one-time $399 million pre-tax loss on a net basis related to several actions taken to optimize the
balance sheet, managed the interest rate volatility impact on capital levels and position the company for future
growth. Subsequent to obtaining regulatory approval for the transaction, we entered into interest rate hedges to
manage rate volatility and its related impact on regulatory capital from the date of approval through the closing of
the transaction in December. During that timeframe, long-term interest rates increased nearly 50 basis points
before declining approximately 65 basis points. The interest rate swaps were terminated at the time of closing and
the losses recognized through earnings largely offset the interest rate marks recorded into the balance sheet
through purchase accounting.
In addition, the company optimized its balance sheet by selling certain loans and repositioning its investment
portfolio on certain equity investments. Within noninterest expenses, we incurred merger and integration-related
charges of $90 million that primarily included the impact of specific deal closing costs, professional services and
employee-related expenses. We also incurred a $791 million charge to the provision for credit losses, which
reflects an initial provision impacted by the acquisition of $662 million and a net loss of $129 million related to the
securitization of approximately $4 billion of legacy indirect auto loans. Again, these moves enabled us to more
effectively position the balance sheet for profitable growth and optimize returns.
Slide 8 provides a more detailed earnings summary. Union Bank, which was included in our consolidated results
for one month, contributed $302 million of revenue, $221 million of noninterest expenses, $81 million of operating
income and $44 million of net income to the company, representing $0.03 per diluted share.
On slide 9, end-of-period loans increased 13.3% on a linked-quarter basis to $388 billion, which included core
loan growth and acquired loans from Union Bank. Union Bank contributed ending loan balances of $54 billion, net
of purchase accounting adjustments, partly offset by a reduction in balances of $15 billion related to balance
sheet optimization actions, including loan sales and securitizations.
Slide 10 provides end-of-period deposit balance composition. End-of-period deposits increased 11.4% on a
linked-quarter basis to $525 billion, driven by the acquisition, which contributed $86 billion of lower cost deposits

and actions taken as a result of the deal to optimize our funding sources. On a core basis, we saw deposit
balances decline slightly this quarter.
Turning to slide 11, the investment securities portfolio grew 4.2% linked-quarter to $170 billion. The additional
securities from Union Bank were offset by balance sheet optimization actions.
Slide 12 highlights revenue trends. Adjusted net revenue totaled $6.8 billion in the fourth quarter, which included
revenue contribution of $302 million from Union Bank, primarily representing net interest income. For legacy U.S.
Bancorp, net interest income grew 5.5% on a linked-quarter basis and 29.2% year-over-year, driven by a strong
earning asset growth and net interest margin expansion, which benefited from rising interest rates. Results were
partially offset by higher deposit pricing and short-term borrowing costs.
Noninterest income, as adjusted for the legacy company, declined 3.0% compared to the third quarter, driven by a
seasonally lower payment service revenue and lower commercial product revenue, offset by stronger mortgage
banking revenue. Year-over-year, legacy adjusted noninterest income declined 5.5%, driven by lower mortgage
banking revenue from reduced refinancing activity and lower servicing charges, offset by stronger payment
services revenue and trust and investment management fees.
Turning to slide 13, adjusted noninterest expense totaled $4.0 billion in the fourth quarter, including $221 million
from Union Bank. Included in expenses was approximately $42 million of intangible amortization due to core
deposit intangibles established at the time of the acquisition. Legacy noninterest expense, as adjusted, increased
3.8% on a linked-quarter basis, largely driven by higher compensation-related expenses as well as higher
expenses related to professional services, marketing, technology and tax credit amortization.
Slide 14 shows credit quality trends. We reported total net charge-offs for the quarter of $578 million. After
adjusting for acquisition impacts and the balance sheet optimization activities, net charge-offs totaled $210 million
or 0.23% of average loans, up from 0.19% in the third quarter, which reflected the continuing normalization of
credit losses.
Nonperforming assets for the legacy bank increased slightly, while Union Bank contributed $329 million to the
total. On a combined basis, the reported ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was 0.26%
at December 31 compared with 0.20% at September 30 and 0.28% a year ago, reflecting a continued strong
credit quality.
The provision for credit losses was $1.19 billion, which included a provision of $791 million related to the
acquisition and balance sheet optimization activities. This provision includes an initial provision impacted by the
acquisition of $662 million and $129 million related to our balance sheet optimization activities. The allowance for
credit losses as of December 31 totaled $7.4 billion or 1.91% of period-end loans, which reflects increased
economic uncertainty and the incorporation of the Union Bank portfolio.
Slide 15 highlights the drivers of our linked-quarter Common Equity Tier 1 capital position. As of December 31,
our CET1 capital ratio was 8.4%. Acquisition impacts of 180 basis points included an increase in goodwill and
other intangible assets that reflected the impact of credit and interest rate marks, the initial provision for credit
losses, balance sheet optimization actions as well as the increase in risk-weighted assets with the addition of
Union Bank. These impacts were partially offset by an increase to equity related to the shares issued to MUFG as
part of the purchase price of Union Bank.

Slide 16 provides our current expectations of certain financial metrics related to the transaction. The financial and
strategic merits of the deal remain intact and are very attractive. Earnings per share accretion is now expected to
be 8% to 9% in 2023, which is higher than originally estimated. While our tangible book value per share dilution is
higher than initially estimated due to the significant impact of rising interest rates on the interest rate marks at
close, our estimated earn-back period is only slightly longer than our original estimate at two years versus our
original estimate of 1.5 years.
Slide 17 provides a comparison of credit and net fair value marks from the time of our announcement to closing.
Credit marks are lower due to favorable changes in portfolio composition and credit quality, partially offset by
economic deterioration. Interest rate marks, inclusive of loans, securities net of sales, and debt, are higher than
anticipated at announcement due to higher interest rates, but we expect that to accrete quickly back through
earnings. The core deposit intangible is also higher than originally estimated, reflecting the increased value of
lower cost core deposits in a higher rate environment.
I will now provide first quarter and full-year 2023 forward-looking guidance, which is provided on slide 18, starting
with the first quarter 2023 guidance. We expect average earning assets of between $605 million and $610 billion
in the first quarter and the net interest margin that is 5 to 10 basis points higher than the fourth quarter level. Total
revenue is estimated to be in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, including approximately $100 million of
purchase accounting accretion during the quarter. Total noninterest expense, as adjusted, is expected to be in the
range of $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion, inclusive of approximately $125 million of core deposit intangible amortization
related to Union Bank. Our income tax rate, as adjusted, is expected to be approximately 22% to 23% on a
taxable-equivalent basis. We anticipate merger and integration charges of between $200 million and $250 million
for the quarter.
I will now provide guidance for the full-year. For 2023, average earning assets are expected to be in the range of
$610 billion to $620 billion with net interest margin expansion of between 5 to 10 basis points compared with the
fourth quarter of 2022. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $29 billion to $31 billion, inclusive of
between $350 million to $400 million of full-year purchase accounting accretion. Total noninterest expense, as
adjusted for the year, is expected to be in the range of $17 billion to $17.5 billion, inclusive of approximately $500
million of core deposit intangible amortization related to Union Bank. Our estimated full-year income tax rate on a
taxable-equivalent basis, as adjusted, will be approximately 22% to 23%. We expect to have $900 million to $1
billion of merger and integration charges in 2023.
I will now hand it back to Andy for closing remarks.

Andrew J. Cecere
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Thanks, Terry. We accomplished a lot this past year, including the completion of the Union Bank acquisition and a
strong legacy PPNR growth supported by positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis. Union Bank adds
significant scale to our business and deepens our commitment to serving customers and creating economic
opportunities for communities across the West Coast. We continue to target a Memorial Day weekend systems
conversion, incorporating a lift-and-shift approach to our applications, which mitigates risk and allows us to more
quickly capture meaningful cost synergies. There is still a tremendous amount of economic and geopolitical
uncertainty and we are preparing for any scenario. I believe we will perform well because of the strength of our
business, our strong balance sheet and the great team we have. As we've proven during previous economic
downturns, our business model is resilient and recession-ready, in large part due to our disciplined through-the-
cycle credit underwriting standards and robust risk management infrastructure. Our consumer clients are
predominantly prime, super prime, and our commercial book is generally investment-grade and we have very little

leverage lending commitments. We are focused on prudent balance sheet growth, high-return, high-margin
opportunities and the prudent allocation of capital to lines of business and products best served to deliver on our
strategic objectives. Our growth strategy is focused on creating value for our customers, communities and
shareholders, which allow us to generate industry-leading performance.
Let me close by saying thank you to our 77,000 employees across the company, including our newest colleagues
from Union Bank. Your dedication and commitment are what make U.S. Bank special and the destination of
choice for all the constituents we serve. We'll now open up the call for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And we can first go to
Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning, Scott.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Hi, Scott.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Maybe a question for you. Just sort at the top-level, I was hoping you could speak to what sort of balance sheet
and capital management will look like for you? So you're still under $700 billion in assets but any thought on sort
of limiting growth or will there be additional sales or securitizations to help keep you under there?
And then, I guess, on repurchase I know we're on pause until we get back to the common equity Tier 1 target. But
with the sort of looming category move up, would there be any thought to hold off longer than that just to sort of
see what happens? Just any thoughts on either of those would be great, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Scott, I'll start. This is Andy and Terry will add in. So, first of all, we're not limiting growth in the company. One of
the reasons we positioned the balance sheet and took the optimization actions we talked about that Terry went
through was to allow for profitable growth. It also was related to the credit box that we managed within as well as
the returns that some of those categories of assets that we securitized were returning. So those are all allowing
us to grow in a profitable way in the future.
As we've talked about before, we do not expect to cross the threshold of a Cat II until the earliest at the end of
2024 and that's into the new category at that time. And if we have any further balance sheet optimization actions
at securitizations, they would be very nominal and not material in nature.
Terry, what would you add?

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. No, I would just again reiterate we're ready to be able to adopt Category II by the end of 2024 but there's
no real cap. We wouldn't expect any real significant balance sheet optimization from here. And we spent a lot of
time positioning the balance sheet for growth as we go forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Wonderful. And then just sort of thoughts on repurchase as well? I know we're on pause for now but it's still sort of
a question mark, so would be curious to your thoughts?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Scott. So as we've said in that, we continue to expect that. We are starting about at a good spot, about
8.4% CET1. We expect that to accrete up to at or above 9% by the end of next year and it continued to accrete,
2023, and continued to move up from that particular point. So one of the things we'll do is once we get to above
9%, we'll have to make an assessment as to all the different things that are happening out there from a regulatory
perspective. I mean you have the regulators looking at Basel III and are having to think about Category II and
those sorts of things. But I think it's really going to be based upon what the landscape at that particular point in
time looks like. But certainly in terms of our core CET1, it will accrete nicely throughout 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Wonderful. All right. Appreciate all the thoughts. Thank you.

...all the details that you gave us on the slides. My first question is on the cadence of the cost synergies as it
relates to your expected Memorial Day weekend conversion. So first clarification question, the 35% cost
synergies, is that a target for full-year 2023 and what is that cadence like? Do we expect very little in cost

synergies until Memorial Day weekend and then an acceleration in cost synergy capture as the systems
converge?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah, Erika. Great question. And just to confirm, our expectation is that of the $900 million of cost synergies, we'll
see about 35% of that next year in 2023. And so from a cadence standpoint, with the Memorial Day conversion,
the vast majority of those cost synergies will start to really kick in subsequent to that system conversion. So,
smaller during the first-half of the year, much more significant of that 35% in the second-half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. So, in other words, we should anticipate an exit rate by 4Q 2023 of well above 35%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. By the time we get to the end of the fourth quarter, we will have incorporated the vast majority of the cost
synergies such that by the time we get to 2024, we will be in a good position to have achieved 100%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And my follow-up question is on the economic outlook. If you could remind us what is being captured in the
legacy U.S. Bank reserves in terms of the GDP outlook and the unemployment outlook. And how are you thinking,
based on that outlook, charge-offs for legacy U.S. Bank would trend. As we anticipate, it seems like a lot of your
peers are anticipating a mild recession from here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I would say that our expectations are probably consistent with that sort of a thought process. When we are
thinking about the reserve, our base case is that if there is a mild recession probably in the second-half of the
year and that unemployment ticks up and GDP is either relatively flat or down a bit. When we go through the
reserving process, as we've said in the past we end up looking at five different potential scenarios all the way from
a base case to a severe sort of recession. And I would say that from a reserving perspective, we're a little bit
weighted towards that downside scenario, so a little bit more conservative.
From a charge-off perspective, our expectation kind of using the baseline of about 23 basis points in the fourth
quarter that that will continue to normalize throughout the year. We'll see both the delinquencies and charge-offs
moving up. But to kind of give you some perspective, our pre-pandemic was at 50 basis points. We probably don't
see that until sometime into 2024.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Good morning, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Hey, good morning. I just wanted to clarify. So, you made your positive operating leverage in 2022, over 200
basis points. If you back into the numbers, I'm getting positive operating leverage year-over-year, all-in, of
somewhere between, I don't know, 100 to 900 basis points. I'm not sure if that's correct. And if you back into the
numbers, what do you get? And why the such big variance in the revenue guide? That's $29 billion versus $31
billion and why is the margin still increasing 5 to 10 basis points in the fourth quarter? That's a bit more of an
improvement versus others.
A – [05G3JT-E Andy Cecere]>: So, I'll start on a couple of things and then Terry will add in. So, let me sort of go
backwards on your questions. The margin is increasing principally because of the value of the low-cost deposits
that Union Bank brings on. We talked about that a lot, Mike, and $85 billion of principally consumer low-cost,
stable deposits in this environment is very valuable in driving up that margin on a quarterly basis. And that's
reflected in that 5 to 10 basis points. We did achieve 230 basis points of positive operating leverage in 2020 – I
can hear a little bit of background.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
George Andersen A
Investor Relations Contact, U.S. Bancorp
Hey, Mike, we're getting a little background. Can you mute your line? Thanks.
A – [05G3JT-E Andy Cecere]>: We did achieve 230 basis points of positive operating leverage in 2022. We would
expect to achieve continued positive operating leverage into 2023. But 2023 is going to have the merger-related
charges in it as well. So I'm looking at it on a core basis.
And Terry, what would you add?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Just maybe kind of coming back to the net interest margin, we expect see a lift related to Union Bank
coming on, that 5 to 10 basis points. And then from there, kind of flattish to maybe moderate increase or
expansion in net interest margin through the rest of the year. But clearly, deposit betas and things like that are
going to accelerate a bit in 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And as a follow-up, look, U.S. Bancorp had been a low-cost producer for a long time. It looks like you're going to
trend back in that direction. So, it sounds like you still have no change in expected synergies. I get it, Union Bank

is performing better and that's why the accretion you had brought higher, the 8% to 9%, but still no change in
expected synergies from the acquisition?
And then, separate from that, Andy, you mentioned in December that the big kind of tech investment cycle is now
turning positive versus being a drag the last five-or-so years, if you could elaborate on that? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure, Mike. And you're right, we still are projecting, as Terry went through, $900 million of cost savings, 35% in
2023, 100% fully implemented in 2024. Importantly, we have not, in the guidance that we provided, provided any
revenue synergies. So, it's without revenue synergies which we think there are going to be some, particularly after
the integration and conversion process.
We are past the heavy spend on tech. You're right. We're more of at a flat line and starting to gain the benefits of
that. And part of the benefit of this transaction is leveraging the investments we've made in the company over the
last three or four years to allow us to lift and shift to our technology platform in a very low cost way. So, that
benefit is driving through the synergies that we talk about.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. So on the credit metrics, I know you indicated that you're starting to see normalization in charge-
offs and delinquencies. I wanted to see if you can elaborate a bit more on what income cohorts are you seeing the
normalization? We're hearing from some of the consumer finance players that they are seeing some
normalization impacting – or moving beyond just the non-prime and low income, but into prime and super prime?

And also, what asset classes are you seeing the normalization most obviously? Is it just on the card side or in
other asset classes? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I mean, I – this is Terry. So maybe to address your first question in terms of where we're seeing it and
maybe as kind of a reminder, from an underwriting perspective, we focus on prime, super prime really in all of our
consumer portfolios. To the extent that we're seeing delinquencies starting to tick up, it's more so in the credit
card space. And you're right, it would be probably on the lower bands as opposed to the upper bands at this
particular point in time.
But one of the things we talked about is that when you look at savings or excess savings from a consumer
perspective, they're fairly significant. That is coming down. As that's coming down, people are revolving more on
their credit cards. And I think it's just kind of a natural progression that we are seeing. And again, starting more
with the unsecured and the credit card portfolio, not as much with respect to the other portfolios yet. But as things
continue to normalize, we would expect that, too.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Thanks. Terry, that's helpful. And then I guess related, how does this development in consumer behavior
and your macro assumptions as well, how does that impact your expectations for your payments revenue and
your card revenue and merchant processing revenue as you look out through the year, considering the macro
dynamics? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So, the payments revenue, as you saw, still is well above pre-COVID levels. The card spend is 25% above.
On a year-over-year basis, we're plus 5%. So, spend continues to be strong. The categories of spend are shifting
a little bit and we would expect continued strong spend, but moderating a bit as we go into the rest of 2023 for the
reasons that Terry mentioned. But still expect growth, but again probably more moderate in nature as we go
forward, and the savings level start to normalize and the consumer behavior starts to change.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. And the thing that I would end up adding, John, is that one of the things we've talked about in the merchant
processing is that we think that business is kind of a high-single digits. And when we look at 2023, that's kind of
our expectation for that particular business. Relative to 2022, we anticipate that our credit card revenue – our
cards revenue will strengthen a bit in terms of year-over-year comparisons. And that is primarily because prepaid
sales and prepaid revenue, which has been a drag, kind of starts to moderate. And then, on the corporate
payment card business, we continue to think that that's going to be reasonably strong, certainly high-single digits,
if not low-double digits. And that's – we're continuing to see travel and entertainment recover very nicely in that
particular space. So, we feel pretty good about the payment revenue trends for 2023.

Hey, good morning.

Good morning, Ebrahim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
I just want to follow-up one on credit. So, you talked about consumer. Looking at the CRE slide, just if you don't
mind talking – sharing your perspective around the CRE book, if you're beginning to see any softening either in
certain markets, maybe California or within the office CRE book, which is about 10% of loans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I mean, maybe at a high level, certainly from a CRE perspective, valuations I think are moderating to some
extent. The areas that we have had probably the greatest focus on, if you will, is really office space and that is
really probably as much tied to return to office sort of behaviors or patterns. And I think that that is probably a
longer-term sort of structural adjustment that's going to end up happening and we're just going to have to watch it
over time. But when we just kind of look at the core CRE portfolio, it continues to perform pretty well from a credit
perspective at this particular point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. And I guess, just one separate question around payments. When you think about, in your slide you
mentioned about some of the tech investments and partnerships. Just give us a sense of – remind us around
competitive positioning for USB, how you're thinking about just market share outlook and from this partnership
standpoint, like areas of like secular growth that you see in this business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. As you mentioned, we've made a lot of investments in tech-led activity, and our tech-led investments have
led to that being the principal area of growth for the merchant processing categories. And then on the card side,
the partnership's component continues to be an important strength for us and a point of growth as we look
forward. So those two areas, tech-led on merchant and partnerships on card, are doing well and it's partly due to
the investments we've made over the past few years.

business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A

Many of the investments we made are internal investments that we've developed our capabilities and our
platforms to allow for different activities and allow for integration with some of the software that the company has
used to run their business. We've added as well, as you know, miscellaneous M&A acquisitions that – you said
bolt-ons like a talech or a Bento that add capabilities around the edges. And I think we'll continue to do a little of
both as we look forward.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi Andy, hi Terry, congratulations on closing the deal. Question for you, Terry, on the balance sheet optimization
where you guys decided to sell off certain loans that were acquired. Can you give us some color on what types of
credits were in those sales? And why would they chose – I know they didn't meet your credit profile but what was
the driver of that – I mean some of the details of the credit profiles?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Maybe as a starting point, when we thought about the balance sheet optimization, the things that we were
thinking about is really repositioning the balance sheet to position ourselves for growth going forward to be able to
optimize or improve profitability and looking at profit margins across the various portfolios and returns and then
the risk profile.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
So, maybe from a risk profile perspective, we ended up looking at Union Bank portfolios that we end up acquiring,
and there were a couple of different areas that we focused on. One is that they had acquired a number of loans
related – or through a lending club channel, if you will. And that was something that we had planned to run off
over time originally when we looked at the deal. And we made a decision that when we looked at the kind of the
credit risk profile, how it's originated, et cetera, that we thought that taking care of that upfront made a lot of
sense. The other area that we ended up selling was some commercial real estate in their particular portfolios in
order to be able to kind of bring that concentration down a bit. And then the other areas of optimization was more
on the U.S. Bank side. We ended up looking at lower margin indirect auto loan portfolio. We securitized about $4
billion associated with that particular portfolio.
And then the other things that we ended up looking at in the C&I book of business and across kind of our
corporate space is just relationships that maybe had lower returns associated with it, where we could optimize
that. And so we allowed some of that to run off, so to speak, during the quarter. And those were the primary areas
of focus with respect to the balance sheet optimization.
The last thing I would maybe say on the investment portfolio side is that we ended up selling about $15 billion of
securities, the vast majority of that coming from Union Bank. And that was really to kind of – think about it from a
interest rate risk perspective, HTM perspective, et cetera. But that was the other area where we did some balance
sheet optimization.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Terry, in the corporate loans, were there any shared relationships, meaning you had an exposure to XYZ
company as did Union Bank and the total was maybe too much and you guys decided to take that down as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So, maybe from a risk perspective, looking at holds – hold levels or concentrations with
respect to specific customers, yes, that was a part of the strategy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then just as a follow-up, you guys obviously gave us very good detail on your slides. And on the
credit quality, slide 14, you give us the breakout in the net charge-offs and you show us the reported number at 64
bps versus your core legacy number of 23 basis points. If I pull out the $189 million from the optimization, it looks
like the net charge-off ratio is around 43 basis points, including the Union Bank numbers. Is that kind of the level
we should kind of gear ourselves to for 2023 now that Union will be fully implemented into your business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Let me clarify. So, it's 64 basis points on a reported basis, 23 basis points on a core basis, and there's two
components to that core: The balance sheet securitization that I talked about that you articulated. But then under
CECL, what you end up having to do is you have to recapture loans that they have charged-off, you have to make
an assessment, and then if you believe that that charge-off was appropriate, you'd have to charge that off on Day
1, so to speak.

And there was about $173 million of charge-offs related to that kind of Day 1 one effect associated with CECL. So
there's really kind of three components but 64% on a reported basis, 23% on a core basis. And when we think
about, going forward, I would use the 23 basis points as kind of the start point and that's about $210 million worth
of core charge-offs.

Hi, good morning.

Hi, Betsy.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi and congratulations from my end too and the deck is super clear. I really appreciate all the effort to make it
simple and straightforward.
So a couple of questions for me, just to follow-up on the discussion we just had. Could we also talk a little bit
about how we should think about the reserving level as we go through 2023 and into 2024? Because like you
said, you've got the fair value marks, you had to do the day, you had to do the add as per the CECL rules. So
does reserve ratio stabilize from here? Does it actually inch down? Is there a scenario in which it would move
higher? Could you just frame out on how we should think about that? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I mean obviously it is impacted by a lot of different things in terms of how economic uncertainty ends up
changing and the mix of the portfolio, how it might change. But as we kind of think about 2023, I think that that
191 basis points is probably a good – is a good metric throughout the year. It might inch down a little bit. But I
think that, by and large, we feel pretty comfortable with that as we think about 2023 based upon our kind of base
case, so to speak.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then I have one other question on the growth of the balance sheet. I know you addressed this a bit
before. But when I look at the 2023 guide versus 1Q 2023, it's a slower growth rate than I think we're used to

seeing at USB. So maybe you could help us understand, is this a moderated growth rate during the integration
phase and maybe second-half that should accelerate up or is this the level of growth that we should anticipate?
And then if you don't mind, I have just a couple of ticky-tackies on the purchase accounting and the CDI and how
we should expect that steps down into 2023 and 2024?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Sure. Betsy, this is Andy. So, first, on the growth rate, I think 2022 had exceptional loan growth across many
categories, led by commercial as well as CRE. So, what we would see is that more normalizing. You started to
see that in the fourth quarter. And I think the other fact is that the growth rates are impacted by average balances
and some of the optimization activity that we took down in the fourth quarter. It was a partial quarter in the fourth
quarter, full quarter in the first quarter and the rest of 2023. But the principal driver is a function of loan demand,
which is moderating a bit across most categories. So still growing but a little less than what we saw in 2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
And then Betsy maybe related to your second question, which was around the recognition of the core deposit
intangible over time, probably the way that I would think about it is that it's – it will amortize into income over about
a 10-year period. It will step down and probably a good way of just modeling it is assuming kind of a sum-of-the-
years' digit sort of approach.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And same thing for PAA or how should we think about that? I mean PAA – I know it's different, but [ph] should we
expect (00:43:50) PAA change...?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So that's tied obviously to the life of the loans. And it will end up being impacted by prepayments and all
sorts of things. We ended up looking at their portfolio that we acquired, about half of it is residential mortgage and
half of it is corporate in shorter-term. So probably, if you ended up looking at an average life of four, five years –
four to six years, that sort of timeframe and of course that will also accrete probably a little bit faster on the front-
end.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q

Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. Congratulations. A couple of questions. The tangible book value recovery, the crossover and
the fact that you'd recover that back quickly, can you just give any color on sort of what's the key driver of that? Is
it just simply earnings or is there something else underneath that also that's going to help that come back so
quickly?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. It's principally the accretion effect that we're going to see with respect to Union Bank, the marks and the
underlying earnings of the company.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. So the – because I just heard you say the accretion, the question that Betsy asked, the purchase
accounting accretion that half the loans are mortgages. So that will take – come down I guess over – more
slowly? So is that part of it that pre-purchase accounting accretion is going to stay high for longer?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. No. I really think it's just – it really is the kind of the 8% to 9% accretion levels that we're expecting on...

Vivek Juneja Q

optimization I think it's pretty sizable, $24 billion. Is it all UB or is it some of yours? And which types of deposits?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. It's a great question. From a deposit standpoint, when you think about kind of the optimization that we went
through, we had kind of a focus on a couple of different things. We ended up looking at LCR ratios. We ended up

looking at higher cost deposits, whether that would be brokerage-type deposits or euro-dollar deposits, those
sorts of things. And we made a very conscious decision after getting regulatory approval to kind of reposition that.
On the Union Bank side, the one thing that I would point out is that there's about $8 billion to $9 billion worth of
deposits that came over that were more transitionary. And, over time, those will transition back to their global
investment bank as those customers kind of migrate. So, about half of that migrated in the fourth quarter and I
would expect probably the other half of that to migrate in early 2023. But those were kind of the things we ended
up looking at with respect to deposit and deposit flows. So, it was really looking at trading out low-cost deposits –
or high-cost deposits for low-cost deposits that were coming over from Union Bank and then some of the Union
Bank effect.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
And what was the OCI number at the end of the year? So as we think about where – going to Category II, how
quickly do you expect that to come down so that you can be in better shape?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So, OCI at the end of the year is about $8 billion and the duration of the portfolio is a little over 5%. So if
you can kind of take a look at that, obviously that's assuming that rates don't move from here. Our positioning,
from an investment portfolio perspective, is about 52%, 53% HTM. We've also entered into some pay fixed swaps
that, in effect, kind of get that up to the high-50s.
So, we feel like we're in a pretty good position to be able to deal with – if rates move up a bit or if rates come
down, we have some flexibility there as well. So, we feel like we're in a pretty good spot.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Can you talk about the pace of the capital build from the 8.4% to around 9% by the end of the
year? And then also, if the macro is worse than expected and you have to build reserves more, I realize that
doesn't move the capital that much. But obviously, everyone else is starting at a higher point of capital and there
is focus on how quickly you can get to that 9% or even higher. So, I guess, the question is like what levers can
you pull that kind of aren't that painful if you need a little bit more such as issuing preferreds or some other assets
that you could kind of exit without hitting earnings that much? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I mean, obviously, Matt, from a balance sheet optimization perspective, we're going to be very focused on
profitability, returns, and capital is precious. So, we want to make sure that we are dedicating our resources from
an asset growth perspective in the right spots.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
The pace of growth from 8.4% to a little above 9% by the end of 2023, it's fairly ratable across the four quarters.
Obviously, the first quarter is going to be a little bit lower simply because we will not have seen the cost synergies
and we will be going through and incurring more merger-related costs probably in the earlier part of the year
simply because of the timing of the system conversion. So, the pace is probably a little bit more weighted towards
the back end. But that hopefully, Matt, kind of gives you some perspective.
Again, I'd kind of come back from a reserve point of view, we feel like we look at a lot of different scenarios. We
look at the five different approaches, one of which is a severe recession. We take that into consideration. We
could see unemployment move up to around 6%, 6.5%, and we still feel like we would be in pretty good spot from
a reserving point of view. So if it ends up being at a level that's higher, then we'll have to kind of focus on other
balance sheet optimization activity.

Hey, good morning, guys. First question I just want to ask is just to follow on the outlook for the year. Can you
walk us through just your underlying assumptions for kind of how NII just trajects if we just think about kind of the
core business and in terms of what deposit costs and betas do and how that impacts the underlying trajectory
from the fourth quarter of NII?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. So, obviously, the net interest income is going to be driven by the earning asset growth that we have in
here as well as the margin expansion. We expect that margin expansion to take place, 5 to 10 basis points in the
first quarter because of the full quarter kind of effect of Union Bank. And then, again, our modeling is that the
margin reasonably moderates from there, reasonably flat, maybe up just a little bit.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
From a deposit point of view, clearly, deposit betas are going to accelerate. I think that's the reason why you'll see
the moderation in terms of net interest income – or net interest margin expansion in the second half of the year.
But keep in mind – and again this is kind of – we see that in the first quarter, the Union Bank effect associated
with the value of those deposits that we're bringing on and we'll continue to look at opportunities to kind of
optimize the deposit portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And then just one follow-up on the deal impact. Can you just remind us what type of like amortization
period you're using for both the purchase accounting accretion and the CDI in terms of like is this the run rate that
we keep around for a few years or does that change as you look past 2023? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Well, I think that, again, in 2023, we expect the purchase accounting accretion to be $350 million to $400 million
and the CDI to be about $500 million. As I mentioned earlier I think on the CDI, it steps down over time. But if you
use kind of a 10-year assumption and sum-of-the-years' digits, I think that will get you, from a modeling
perspective, pretty close to how I think it will end up amortizing off.
The purchase accounting is really going to be tied to the asset lives because about half of it is mortgage and half
of it is corporate and commercial, et cetera, and shorter-lived assets. I think you can think about kind of that four
to five year sort of timeframe and it probably accretes down into kind of a similar sort of fashion, a little more front-
end weighted.

Hey, Chris.

Chris Kotowski Q
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Good morning. Hi. Following up a bit on Mike and Ken's questions. If I look at your very helpful slide 18 on the
guidance and I take the midpoint of the $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion revenue range and I kind of day weight that to
the full year, I kind of get the lower range end of the full-year guidance, $29.2 billion is actually what I get. So that
implies like a couple percent growth in the back-half of the year, which again I guess is better than what a lot of
banks are saying. And I'm wondering, is that just underlying loan growth or fee income growth? Or is it the tag-ins
of the benefits of rising rates or what do you see driving that?

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Well, again I think you do see kind of the full-year effect associated with rising interest rates kind of come into
play. Fee revenue, on a legacy basis as an example, we should see a little bit more of a tailwind next year as
opposed to what we experienced this year. So I think that those are kind of coming into play and then I think that
just the timing of being able to get cost synergies on the expense side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. And I would add, it's probably just, mathematically, as you were talking about it that you're right and it's a
little bit of a growth in the earning asset that you see there going up from $605 billion to $610 billion to $610 billion
to $620 billion. That's number one. And then maybe going towards the high-end of that range and net interest
margin versus the mid- or low-end in the early quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Kotowski Q
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Kotowski Q
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Well, it's interesting because if I do the same analysis on the noninterest expense side, you're at the high-end of
that, so it implies kind of nice growth in pre-provision earnings through the course of the year. So – but anyway
that's it for me.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
All right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

[indiscernible] (00:55:58) before. AOCI, was it – I'm just going through the number here, $12 billion, now it's $8
billion and where is it as of today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
OCI overall is at $10 billion at the end of the year and expect it to come down from there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
At a lower level today, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then Andy just can you pull the lens back a little bit? It's been a rough three, five and 10 years when you look
at operating leverage and stock, not last year, on the operating leverage. But that comment you made in
December and you addressed briefly, but you've been in this investment cycle multi-years. And now you said that
you're coming out of it or the drag is less or maybe the spending is less and the payoffs are more. Can you just
give us more color on both the spending side and the payback side and where you've invested the most and
where you expect that payback? Because it sounds like you're crossing a line based on your comment from
December that you reiterated today? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Cecere A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Bancorp
Yes. Thanks, Mike. I think that's a fair representation. So, we – our spend levels on pure CapEx were – grew from
about $800 million to $900 million to $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion and that growth has been in the run rate for the last
couple of years. So you would not expect to see additional continued expense increase related to CapEx.
Importantly, we also migrated that spend from about 60% defensive to 60% offensive. So the spend is on
activities like digital capabilities, reaching customers, products and services and so forth.
So all of that is what's coming through right now, so a level-set on the expense side plus a return on the
investments from a revenue side. That, coupled with overlaying all that on the Union Bank customer base is why
we're projecting the numbers that we're giving you.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2023
Good morning, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Good morning, guys. Hey. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. So Terry where does the balance sheet repositioning
and the merger leave you in terms of interest rate positioning and how would you describe it here, fairly neutral, a
little bit asset-sensitive, where you're ending up now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. I would say that legacy U.S. Bank is fairly neutral. When we add Union Bank on, it probably adds about 50
basis points of asset sensitivity in a 50 basis points up sort of shock environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. And then on the fee income, you said some more tailwinds this year, some helpers on legacy U.S.
Bancorp. What are those on the fee income front? What are the helpers this year that you can grow fee income?
Maybe just put-and-takes on fees real quick.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Well, if you just kind of look at the different components, I think the payments revenue continues to be
reasonably strong. I think that the expectation is the market comes back a little bit in terms of investment income.
But deposit service charges, we saw a drag in 2022 because of some pricing changes we implemented in May
that starts to dissipate. So, I think it will be kind of a combination of things. But probably one of the biggest ones is
just mortgage banking revenue. That has been a pretty significant drag, especially on a year-over-year basis. And
in the fourth quarter, we actually started to see that inflection point with linked-quarter revenue starting to come up
and we would expect that to be a little bit stronger as we go into 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. Got it. And then the last clarification. I think on reserves you said the 1.9% ratio looks pretty good for this
year. Even if unemployment went to 6%, 6.5%, you'd be okay?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terrance R. Dolan A
Chief Financial Officer & Vice Chairman, U.S. Bancorp
Yeah. Again, we go through a lot of different scenarios and we take that downside into consideration and as part
of kind of that weighted average process. We think 6%, 6.5% unemployment is already incorporated into our
reserving process. So – but again it all is going to depend upon what ends up happening, how severe the
economic recession is, if there is one at all. So, I think there's just a lot of moving parts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Got it. Thank you.
