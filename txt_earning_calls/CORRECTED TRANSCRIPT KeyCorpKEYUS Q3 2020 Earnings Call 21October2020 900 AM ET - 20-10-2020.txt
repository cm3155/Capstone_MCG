Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to KeyCorp's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. As a
reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I'd now like to turn the conference over to the Chairman and CEO, Chris Gorman. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Well, thank you, operator. And good morning and welcome to Keycorp's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference
Call. Joining me for the call today are Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Midkiff, our Chief Risk
Officer. Slide 2 is our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures. It covers our
presentation materials and comments as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call.
I'm now turning to slide 3. As you saw in our press release this morning, we reported third quarter earnings per
common share of $0.41. Our EPS was more than double that which we reported in the prior quarter and up from
the year-ago period, which was impacted by notable items. Despite the challenging environment, we generated
pre-provision net revenue of $1.9 billion and added $1 billion to our reserve for credit losses through the first nine
months of this year.
Revenue in the third quarter was up 3% from the year ago period. Our net interest income continues to reflect the
low rate environment, elevated liquidity and changes in balance sheet mix. Average loans reflect strong
performance from consumer mortgage and Laurel Road, offset by paydowns of consumer line draws that were
made earlier in the year. Our consumer mortgage business generated funded volume of more than $2.3 billion
this quarter, which was up more than 75% from the year-ago period and 5% from last quarter.
Over one-half of our originations were purchase mortgages. Our pipelines remain strong, and we expect to show
sustainable growth and continued market share gains. Laurel Road continues to originate high-quality loans that
provide us with an opportunity to build broader digital relationships with these targeted clients.
In the third quarter, Laurel Road originated over $400 million. We believe that both Laurel Road and consumer
mortgage will continue to be relationship-based growth engines for our consumer business. With our strong
consumer platform, we have decided to discontinue originating indirect auto loans. The current portfolio of
approximately $4.6 billion will run off over time.
Now let me turn to fee income. We had another good quarter. Noninterest income was up from the year-ago
period, reflecting stronger-than-expected performance. Investment banking and consumer mortgage had another
solid quarter. Cards and payments and service charges on deposit accounts both posted strong linked quarter
increases. Don will discuss our revenue outlook in his remarks. We believe we are well positioned to continue to
grow both our commercial and consumer businesses.
Our expenses this quarter reflect higher variable costs related to cards and payments activity and production-
related incentives as well as elevated pandemic-related costs associated with keeping our teammates and our
clients safe. Through our continuous improvement efforts, we are maintaining our focus on expenses, improving
our efficiency, while continuing to invest for growth, particularly our digital capabilities across the franchise.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
Credit quality remained solid this quarter, as we have remained true to our moderate risk profile throughout the
cycle. Net charge-offs for the quarter were 49 basis points. In the deck, we have updated our disclosure on
commercial portfolio focus areas. Don will cover these focus areas in his comments, but I will just say that these
portfolios have generally performed consistent with or better than our expectations.
The quality of our loan book is also reflected in the level of loan deferrals. Last quarter, our deferrals were the
lowest in our peer group, based upon public disclosures. As of September 30, loans subject to forbearance terms
were less than 2% of total loans. That's down from 4.3% at June 30. This equates to less than 1% of clients in
both our commercial and consumer businesses.
In the third quarter, our provision expense exceeded charge-offs by $32 million. Our allowance for credit losses as
a percentage of period-end loans now stands at 1.88%, or 2.04% excluding PPP loans.
Finally, we have maintained our strong capital position, while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. In
the third quarter, our common equity tier 1 ratio increased to 9.5%, which is at the upper end of our targeted
range of 9% to 9.5%. In September, we paid a common stock dividend of $0.185 per share, the same amount we
paid in the second quarter.
I will close by restating that this was another good quarter for Key, which demonstrates our underlying strengths.
It starts with our dedicated team and their unwavering commitment to, first and foremost, our clients; being very
targeted about where we can compete and where we can win; next costs, maintaining a strong focus on
expenses, while investing for the future, a big part of this investment going forward will continue to be digital;
credit, continuing our strong risk management practices; and lastly capital, focusing both on the return on and the
return of capital. I am confident in our ability to manage through the current environment and, over time, achieve
our long-term financial targets and, importantly, deliver value for all of our stakeholders.
Now, let me turn the call over to Don to go through the results of the quarter. Don?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Thanks, Chris. I'm now on slide 5. As Chris said, we reported third quarter net income from continuing operations
of $0.41 per common share. Results also reflected momentum across our businesses, including growth in our
balance sheet and fee income, as well as continued strong risk discipline and capital management. I will cover
many of the remaining items on this slide in the rest of my presentation.
So turning to slide 6, total average loans were $105 billion, up 14% from the third quarter of last year, driven by
growth in both commercial and consumer loans. Commercial loans reflect an increase of over $8 billion from PPP
loans. Consumer loans benefited from continued growth from Laurel Road and, as Chris mentioned, strong
performance from our residential mortgage business. Laurel Road originated over $400 million of student
consolidation loans this quarter and we generated $2.3 billion of consumer mortgage loans. The investments we
have made in these areas continue to drive results and, importantly, add high-quality loans to our portfolio.
Linked quarter average loan balances were down 3%, reflecting paydowns from the heightened commercial line
draws earlier this year. The paydowns on the lines were greater than expected and now the utilization rate is
below the start of the year. Importantly, we have remained disciplined with our credit underwriting and have
walked away from business that does not meet our moderate risk profile. We remain committed to performing well
through the business cycle and we manage our credit quality with this longer-term perspective.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
Continuing on to slide 7, average deposits totaled $135 billion for the third quarter of 2020, up $25 billion, or 22%,
compared to the year-ago period and up 5% from the prior quarter. The linked quarter increase reflects broad-
based commercial deposit growth as well as growth from consumer stimulus payments and lower consumer
spending. This growth was offset by a decline in time deposits, primarily related to lower interest rates. Growth
from the prior year was driven by both consumer and commercial clients.
Total interest-bearing deposit costs came down 20 basis points from the prior quarter, reflecting the impact of
lower interest rates and the associated lag in pricing. We would expect deposit costs to continue to decline about
6 to 9 basis points in the fourth quarter. We continue to have a strong, stable core deposit base with consumer
deposits accounting for over 60% of our total deposit mix.
Turning to slide 8, taxable-equivalent net interest income was $1 billion for the third quarter of 2020 compared to
$980 million a year ago, and $1.025 billion for the prior quarter. Our net interest margin was 2.62% for the third
quarter of 2020 compared to 3% for the same period last year, and 2.76% for the prior quarter. Both net interest
income and net interest margin were meaningfully impacted by the significant growth in our balance sheet in the
third quarter of 2020. The larger balance sheet benefited net interest income that reduced our net interest margin
due to the significant increase in liquidity driven by strong deposit inflows.
Compared to the prior quarter, net interest income decreased $19 million driven by lower commercial loan
balances. The net interest margin was primarily impacted by continued elevated levels of liquidity. Elevated
liquidity levels negatively impacted the margin by 13 basis points, with all other drivers netting to an additional 1
basis point of pressure on the margin. The lower than expected commercial loan balances contributed an
additional 5 basis points of margin compression.
Recently, we have received several questions about the future impact of our interest rate swap maturities on our
net interest margin. On slide 20, in the appendix, we provide a schedule that details maturities of our swaps. Also,
it is important to understand that this portfolio is only one of the fixed rate asset classes as all banks are impacted
by maturities of fixed rate loans and investment securities. We also show on this slide that our level of these
assets combined as a percentage of total earning assets is in line with peers.
Moving on to slide 9, our fee-based businesses had another strong quarter. Noninterest income was $681 million
for the third quarter of 2020 compared to $650 million for the year-ago period, and $692 million in the second
quarter. Compared to the year-ago period, noninterest income increased $31 million. The primary driver was an
increase of $35 million in consumer mortgage business as we continue to grow the business and see record
levels of originations.
Cards and payments income also increased $45 million related to the prepaid card activity from the state
government support programs. Compared to the second quarter of 2020, noninterest income decreased by $11
million. The largest driver of the quarterly decrease was $22 million of lower operating lease income as we had
gains on leveraged leases in the prior quarter, which impacted the quarter-over-quarter comparison.
Consumer mortgage income was down $11 million, following a record quarter for related fees in the second
quarter. These were partially offset by an increase in cards and payments-related income and higher service
charges on deposit accounts. Though down quarter-over-quarter, investment banking and debt placement fees
had another solid quarter given the volatile environment, coming in at $146 million for the quarter.
I'm now turning to slide 10. Total noninterest expense for the quarter was $1.037 billion compared to $939 million
last year and $1.013 billion in the prior quarter. The increase from the prior year is primarily related to $52 million

of payments-related cost reported in other expense, as well as COVID-19-related expenses to ensure the health
and safety of our teammates.
Higher personnel costs from the year-ago quarter reflects lower deferred loan origination costs, merit increases
and higher employee benefit costs. Compared to the prior quarter, noninterest expense increased $24 million.
The increase was largely due to higher payments-related costs as well as personnel costs related to elevated
employee benefits, primarily health care, which was up $15 million last quarter.
Moving on to slide 11, overall credit quality remains solid. For the quarter, net charge-offs were $128 million or 49
basis points of average loans. Our provision for credit losses exceeded net charge-offs by $32 million or $0.03 per
share. Nonperforming loans were $834 million this quarter, or 81 basis points of period-end loans, compared to
$585 million or 63 basis points from the year ago quarter. Additionally, delinquencies actually improved quarter-
over-quarter with a 6 basis point decrease in our 30 to 89-day past dues, and the 90-day plus category also
declining quarter-over-quarter.
We continue to monitor the level of assistance requests we receive from our customers. Over the past quarter,
the number of requests for loan forbearances have decreased dramatically. As of September 30, loans subject to
forbearance were less than 1% based on the number of accounts for both commercial and consumer loans, and
less than 2% when using outstanding balances.
Turning to slide 12, as Chris mentioned, we updated our disclosure that highlights certain portfolios that are
receiving greater focus in the environment. These areas represent a small percentage of our total loan balances.
Each relationship in these focus areas continues to be subject to active reviews and enhanced monitoring.
Importantly, as a group, they continue to perform consistent with our expectations.
Turning to slide 13, we had shared a summary of our deferrals compared to peers at a recent investor
conference. As shown here, our deferral level was peer-leading in the second quarter. As noted earlier, we have
seen a dramatic reduction in the deferral levels during the third quarter.
Now on to slide 14, we have continued to maintain a strong level of capital. We ended the third quarter with our
common equity tier 1 ratio of 9.5%, up 40 basis points from 9.1% in the second quarter. This places us at the
upper end of our targeted range of 9% to 9.5%. We believe that this provides us with sufficient capacity to
continue to support our customers and their borrowing needs and return capital to our shareholders.
In the third quarter, we paid a common dividend of $0.185 per share, which was consistent with our second
quarter level. Importantly, over the last four quarters, beginning with the fourth quarter 2019, we have earned
$1.14 per share, well above our current dividend run rate of $0.74 per share.
On slide 15, we have provided our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect average loans to be down low-single
digits, reflecting lower period end balances coming into the fourth quarter. Consumer loans should continue to
grow. We expect deposits to remain relatively stable.
Core net interest income should increase low-single digits with a relatively stable net interest margin, reflecting
the expected benefit of the repayment of PPP loans. The benefit of repayment is estimated to be $20 million to
$25 million.
Noninterest income in the fourth quarter will remain relatively stable, reflecting an expected decline in consumer
mortgage, offset by growth in investment banking and debt placement fees.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
Noninterest expense are expected to be down low-single digits, but are highly dependent on the level of variable
cost, including production-related incentives. Net charge-offs are expected to be in the 55 to 65 basis point range
next quarter.
And finally, as shown on the bottom of the slide, are our long-term targets. On a reported basis, we will not
achieve all the targets this year. As we emerge from the pandemic and the economy strengthens, we expect to be
back on the path that would lead us to operate within all of our targeted ranges.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for instructions on the Q&A portion of our call. John?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And first we go to the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.
Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, everyone...

Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Good morning, Scott.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thank you for taking my question. Hey. Let's see, Don, maybe wanted to ask first just on the decision to stop
originating indirect auto. So the $4.6 billion that will run off, how long is it going to take for those to run up? I'm
imagining three years or less. But I guess more importantly, do you guys feel like you can outrun that runoff and
still generate net growth, for example, via mortgage and Laurel Road where you've got strong origination
outlooks?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Sure, Scott. The average life of that portfolio is about 2.5 years. So it will take probably, in total, about 5 years
before it fully runs off. So we will see declines each year in those balances. And Chris can highlight a little bit
more as far as the rationale and thoughts as far as the exit of those originations. And also why we're excited
about the consumer loan origination capacity we can generate now. So...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. So, Scott, we've talked a lot about relationships. We've talked a lot about targeted scale. And frankly, the
indirect book was, from a quality perspective, it's just fine; from a return perspective, obviously, you can't generate
the kind of relationship returns that we would expect because it's a single product.

Conversely, as you look at our consumer business, as you well know, two years ago, we really didn't have a
mortgage business. This year we were able originate more than $8 billion. Two years ago, we didn't have our
Laurel Road business. This year we'll generate more than $2 billion. And we have big plans, obviously, to
continue to grow both of those.
So the premise of your question, do we think we can outrun it in our consumer business? We do. And we think we
can do it on a relationship basis and, really, use our capital to support our clients or for other things, whether it's
stock buybacks or whatever that we think are better use of capital.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
All right. Perfect. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. And then, separately just sort of a top level question.
Now that sort of coming out of the worst of the pandemic, a lot of banks tend to be kind of applying lessons
learned from ability to operate without the same sort of infrastructure. Just curious how you guys are thinking
about the branch footprint, if you might see any opportunities for something broader to do on the cost side here as
we sort of stare down a challenging revenue environment for the next couple of years?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure, Scott. We think the pandemic certainly accelerated some trends that were already there. Just to give you
some texture. When we bought First Niagara, we had 1,600 branches. Today, we have 1,077. We've invested
heavily in digital. Our digital take-up, more than 60% of our customers are now digitally active. And so we actually
think there is a significant opportunity to take a look at the fleet. And we're in the final throes of planning that and
we'll have more to say on that in January.
But in addition to some other things that are fundamental changes, we do think there'll be a change in kind of how
we look at the density of our branches. And as you know, we're in some fast-growing areas where we have
relatively thin branch footprints, and we think we can replicate that and get the mix right of digital and physical in
other parts of our franchise.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. All right. So I guess we'll sort of stay tuned till January on that. So...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Good.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
Hey, thanks. Don, you mentioned that you expect the $20 million to $25 million of PPP accelerated amortization in
fourth quarter. I think you're actually one of the only banks that I've heard, so far at least, that's building that in. I
think most are looking at first quarter. Has the SBA actually opened up the portal – or the forgiveness portal and
are they approving loans? Or is this sort of a question mark in terms of whether or not it actually goes into fourth
quarter or not based on the SBA?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
We were hearing earlier that several other banks were using the same type of assumptions, if not even more
aggressive as far as their prepayment. But the SBA has opened, we've actually started to see some of the
requests from customers go through and actually get funded here recently, too. So it still is more of a trickle but
we're starting to see volumes and activity levels pick up, and that's what gives us the basis for our outlook.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. That's great. And then the other question I had, I guess, what are you guys planning to do with the excess
liquidity on the balance sheet? Like how quickly can you deploy? Do you want to deploy it? Where is it going into?
Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. We've been looking at all different kinds of uses of that and whether or not we can put it to better use than
just sitting in cash. Our challenge right now is, is that we tend to keep a fairly conservative investment portfolio
and really don't want to venture into credit risk in that area. And so the returns on similar type of agency securities
that we would invest in are right around 100 basis points. And so we'll continue to assess that to see if we lean
into that a little bit more.
I would say that we, on a trial basis, started to do – buy some longer-dated assets and put some forward starting
swaps against that, that we'll convert that asset to a variable rate, say, five years down the road, which is better
aligned with our overall strategy and risk profile. And so we'll consider doing things like that. But near term, I think
we will continue to see elevated levels of liquidity, including cash and Treasury bills just because we feel that
that's more prudent for us to do in this environment.

Donald R. Kimble A

Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
My first question is for you, Don. I think that investor conversations have turned from simply credit to thinking
about banks on a normalized return basis. And so as I think about the progression of net interest income from that
$1.006 billion, so if we exclude any PPP impact, I'm wondering if you could help us in terms of the walk to what
the quarterly run rate could look like in 2021 ex-PPP.
Because, obviously, the runoff of the indirect portfolio is new news versus your high cash levels that Ken just
mentioned that you could possibly redeploy versus, I think, there's a $40 million swing in hedge income
contribution from this quarter to perhaps fourth quarter of 2021. So any help you can give in terms of how we think
about where your net interest income could bottom and, of course, not assuming any loan growth or any changes
in the rate environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. We'll provide more specifics on 2021 in January. I would say that as far as some of the moving parts that
you're right that our swap portfolio will continue to mature over time. I would say that as we highlight on slide 20
that there a number of fixed rate type of asset classes, including the swaps, the loan portfolio and also the
investment portfolio. And I would say that as we look at how we're positioned compared to others, we think that
we're right in line with peers as far as that relative mix as far as fixed rate assets.
As we look at going forward, we think that our margin will probably bottom out something fairly close to where
we're at today with, over time, having a redeployment of some of that liquidity into other loan categories, whether
it's consumer or at some point in time seeing some commercial loan growth back up again. And so the pressure
from these rates and the impact on the maturity and the rollover of those fixed rate asset classes would be offset
by the utilization of some of those liquidity sources. And so that would include, in that outlook, some prepayment
of those PPP loans.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just a follow-up question, and maybe this one – this is for Chris. Clearly, 2020 was an exceptional
year. As we think about 2021 and you sort of teased out a potential announcement and are thinking about
infrastructure and branches for January. If you weigh the revenue headwinds with efficiency opportunities, do you
think KeyCorp can get back on positive operating leverage track next year?

I do. I do. And continuous improvement, Erika, is part of our culture. Each year, we've taken out sort of 3% to 5%
and used that as raw material to invest. And we will continue to do that. I think there's some fundamental changes
in the way banking is done. And I am confident in both the trajectory of our earnings streams and also our ability
to manage our expenses.
We do have kind of a unique situation this quarter in that half of the year-over-year increase is attributable to
prepaid cards. I'm not saying that that's completely nonrecurring, but I will say that we've invested a bunch of
time, energy, people and technology to tamp that down. So, the answer your question is yes.

Matthew O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
I just wanted to follow up on the exit of the indirect auto. I mean it's not that big of a deal, but it's also a portfolio
that you've been growing, I think, pretty nicely just in the past years here. I think that was kind of one of the
strategic additions you got from First Niagara. So, I'm just wondering like has something changed in the
marketplace in the last, I don't know, three or six months or maybe just elaborate on kind of the timing now,
especially at a time when there's just not a lot of loan growth for the industry overall.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
So, Matt, the real timing as we've now successfully, from a standing start, built the Laurel Road platform and our
mortgage platform. We acquired First Niagara in 2016. We really didn't have an engine for consumer loans. And it
was a good bridge. It being indirect auto was a good bridge. But we've always stayed pretty true to the notion that
we're a relationship bank and we're focused on targeted scale where we can be relevant. And as we look at that
portfolio in conjunction with the returns, it just didn't achieve what we wanted it to do vis-à-vis investing our capital
elsewhere.
Now, in terms of anything changing in the market, this isn't what drove the decision. But as you know, the
automobile market right now is very hot. Our analyst thinks that sales at retail next year will be up like 9.5%. The

value of used vehicles right now, because of shutdowns due to COVID-19, are up 15% or 20%. That's not what
drove the decision, but that is a fundamental macro driver that's out there.

Matthew O'Connor Q

And then, I understand how mortgage is a relationship product. But just remind us on Laurel Road, how you've
transformed that into more of a relationship product versus kind of a one-off?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. So this is something that we're, frankly, very excited about. We're building a national digital bank and it's
going to be focused on health care professionals. And so, we've already obviously built the loan consolidation
business, that's all digital. Then in many cases, within six months, something like 50% of those customers that
refinance their doctor and dental school loans buy a home. We've now built a complete digital mortgage
application.
And where we can take it from there is, on a national basis, to be really focused, Matt, around doctors and
dentists in terms of opening accounts, et cetera. And that will open up then the opportunity for us, in the case of
dentists most, because they're mostly independent business people as opposed to doctors who are part of large
groups, that will give us an avenue to do a lot with them. So, we see Laurel Road as a platform that we've grown
a lot. It's achieved everything we hoped it would and we think there's a lot to do on top of it.
And then one other area where we could potentially focus is expand beyond doctors and dentists but within health
care. Health care, as you know, is 18% of the GDP going to 20%, kind of $6 trillion going to $8 trillion. So that's
how we're thinking about it.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
Can you guys share with us – I think you mentioned on the call that you're at the top end of your capital guidelines
of 9.5%. We know the share repurchase programs have been temporarily suspended by the Federal Reserve at
least through the end of the year.
Can you share with us your thinking of share repurchases for 2021 and where you'd like to bring that capital ratio
down to? And because the change in the stress test where the Fed does not approve any longer a bank's plan to
buy back stock or pay a dividend; as long as you surpass the required minimal capital ratio, you've got the latitude
or the optionality to kind of do the buyback the way you see fit.
So could you give us some thoughts on could you ever consider a Dutch auction, if this suspension goes into the
second half of next year and your capital ratios in the high 9s, to do one big buyback at one time to bring down
the capital ratio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Gerard, this is Don. And as far as the share repurchases, we feel very good about where our capital position is
today. I would say, to your point that we would expect that the capital ratio is to continue to increase as long as
we're not buying back shares. And so we highlighted that we are up 40 basis points.
As far as the consideration for when we would be back in to buy shares, that we'd want to have a little bit better
clarity as far as the clear direction on the economy and where that's heading, and making sure that we continue to
have the capital to support our customers, support our organic growth and continue to support the dividend. And
so those will be priorities for us above just the share buyback.
One other potential consideration is that with the impact of the CECL accounting change and how it impacts our
capital ratios, there's about a 30 basis point or so impact that we'll see over time there as well. But we do feel very
good about where we're at from a capital perspective. We do believe that it will increase. And if available and
things allow and permit, we could consider adjustments that would allow us to probably more proactively manage
that overall share count with either a large share repurchase program or market purchases like we've done in the
past.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then circling back to credit, obviously, Key, in the past, has had issues with credit during a
recession. And I know it's been a goal of management to prove to investors that's not going to be the case in this
cycle.
If we exclude for a moment, the change in mix of your portfolio today versus what it was like in 2007, and you take
a look at, obviously, the government fiscal programs that have been implemented to help people through this
downturn, what are you guys seeing today that really strikes you as different than what you've seen in the past on
the behaviors of your borrowers?

Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Deleveraging.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Maybe I'll go ahead and start, Gerard, and Chris and Mark might have some thoughts to add to that. But I would
say that the biggest difference that I would see – and this is just coming in midstream in this, but Key really has
pivoted to a relationship strategy.
And if you take a look at where the portfolio was before the last crisis, that it was more transaction-oriented as
opposed to relationship. And so we've had outsized exposure in some commercial real estate developers, and it
was more on the project as opposed to an ongoing steady stream of cash flow for us. And so I'd say that the
migration to that relationship strategy is having a huge payback for us.
On the consumer side, we're following similar trends. It's a very high quality, very consistent portfolio. And as we
talked earlier, we really want to continue to have that more on a relationship-type of approach as opposed to
transaction. I don't know. Chris, will you add to that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
What I would add, it's been a 10-year journey. After the financial crisis, we sat down and evaluated where we lost
money, how we lost money and that we basically – it was principally in real estate. It was project-level real estate.
It was where we didn't have a deep relationship. In some cases, it was business that was indirect business, third-
party business. And we went about the business of derisking our portfolio. And we have been disciplined enough
that we have foregone revenues such that we could position ourselves so we have the capital and the ability to
support our clients and targeted prospects in an environment like this.
The other thing I would just remind everyone of is of the capital we raise for our customers, Gerard, only 18% of it
goes onto our balance sheet. And so that, too, is something that I think is unique for us and that we can serve our
clients without necessarily putting it on our balance sheet. But you're exactly right, it's been a long journey.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Thank you. Good morning, Chris and Don. Thanks for the disclosures on slide 20. I wanted to ask about the
hedging program runoff on the bottom right-hand side of the slide. Is the right way to read this chart that if we

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
multiply the weighted average yield by the notional value of the on and off-balance sheet hedges, we get the
quarterly contribution from the hedging program? And if so, it looks like the declining hedging benefit would
translate into a $160 million headwind in 2021 and $114 million headwind in 2022. Is that the right thought
process?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
I would say that this assumes that we have no replacement of the swaps going forward. So this is just a runoff of
the existing book. And so depending upon where the yield curve moves and how that would reposition, we could
see some differences there, and then also would assume that we're taking no other actions on-balance sheet to
minimize or mitigate some of that impact.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Understood. And if I may, just as a follow-up, so beyond the hedging portfolio runoff, can you discuss a little bit,
maybe just some color on the front book, back book dynamics if the low rate environment persists? Maybe just
give us a sense of how much you're receiving in paydowns of back book loans and securities that would have to
get redeployed, and what the yield differential is between new money rates now and what's coming off.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Sure, can. But generally, our loan portfolio has an average life of about three years. And so just to use that as a
proxy for the kind of roll-off that we would have on the portfolio and repricing. If you take a look at our C&I and
most of our commercial portfolios, they tend to be LIBOR-based.
I'd say that the spreads on new originations are fairly consistent overall with what the back book would have and
not seeing a lot of change in that overall repricing for that portfolio. We have seen a little bit more acceptance of
some floors that are being placed on the products. And so that will be helpful for us going forward. But that book,
as a general rule, doesn't have a lot of repricing – or risk from that perspective.
If you look at some of the fixed rate portfolios, residential mortgage, it's a fairly new portfolio for us. We are seeing
growth there that I think that the current yield on that portfolio on-balance sheet is around a 3.50% or so as far as
residential mortgage. Current production is closer to a 3% kind of overall yield for that portfolio. So, a little bit
below current average rates, but not significantly different.
As far as some of the other consumer categories, whether it's home equity or Laurel Road student loans or some
of the other categories, we're looking at probably about a 80-basis-point-or-so gap between what the existing
portfolio is compared to what the legacy book is on that side.
For the investment portfolio that – for the core portfolio, excluding the treasury bills that we've been adding as far
as some of the excess liquidity position, we're seeing a roll-off of those yields around a 2.40% and a replacement
yield of around 1%. So, about 140 basis points of shift there.
Keep in mind, too, that, as we highlighted on the deposit side, we're expecting to see our average interest-bearing
cost of deposits decrease by 6 to 9 basis points in the fourth quarter. And we should see some additional
opportunities for – benefit there going forward as well, and so probably at a slower pace, but still helping to offset
or minimize some of the exposure there.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, thanks. Guys, I was wondering if you can dig in a little bit more on the outlook for loans. So, obviously, not
surprising to see the declines this quarter from the paydowns. And you mentioned that loans will continue to [ph]
detract (42:01) going forward a little bit. But what do you see in terms of just any change in improvement in
activity on the manufacturing side, on inventory, et cetera, that we might look forward and start to see a point of
stabilization? Some others are even pointing to growth. So, just your broader outlook on the potential inflection in
loans. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. Ken, it's Chris. Good morning. So, there's no question that as we look at our C&I book, the utilization is
below where we would have thought it would be right now. It's frankly below the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis.
I think there's a few things that can serve as a driver to loan growth on the C&I side. One is an inventory rebuild.
And as the economy ramps up – I mean state the obvious as the economy ramps down, these companies throw
off a lot of cash, as it ramps up, they consume cash. I think that could give us an opportunity as well.
The other thing that is going on, M&A discussions in the beginning of the second quarter were nonexistent. As we
look at what are the discussions we're having with our customers day in and day out, I think people are really
starting – you won't see it in the fourth quarter, but people are really starting to think strategically. Just this week, I
met with three clients, and they're in areas that you would think they might still be hunkered down, and they are
really starting to think strategically. So I think the levers on the C&I book will be transactional. But even before
transactional, I'd like to see, obviously, some greater utilization. I think those are a couple of opportunities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And then on the follow-up to that, on the corporate activity side, just wondering if you could talk a little bit
more about the pipeline for investment banking and what the mix of investment banking has been in terms of like
the public versus private and CRE markets. Like, is any of that kind of back to a normal or still have good
pipelines ahead, if you could fill that in, too?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. So as we look forward, I would describe the pipelines as solid. The real variable was our M&A business,
which is a strong business, which basically was nonexistent, as I mentioned, kind of in the second quarter. Our

backlogs now, Ken, in M&A, are equal to what they were going into the crisis. And obviously, a lot of deals went
away. So I find that to be encouraging.
As I look at our fees, this quarter, we were about at $146 million. We, I believe, will be up in the fourth quarter. I
don't think it will be at the record – kind of we've been – we've had $200 million quarters before. I don't think we'll
be at $200 million, but we'll certainly be somewhere between $146 million and $200 million. The pipelines are
solid. The real estate commercial mortgage business, obviously in this rate environment, continues to be pretty
strong.

Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
I wanted to see if we can get some incremental color on risk migration this quarter with the 24% increase in your
criticized assets. Just want to see if you can give us a little bit of the granularity on what drove that migration and
what asset types. And then also, is that increase in criticized reflected at this point in your existing loan loss
reserve? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. I'll go ahead and answer the last part of that question first, and then Mark can help provide some of the
clarity as far as the migration. But as far as our loan loss reserve that we established at June 30 and now at
September 30, keep in mind under CECL that you're looking for the life of loan type of losses. And so embedded
in there is the assumption that you're going to see migration into criticized and classified and increased losses
throughout the next several quarters. And so, those were all baked into both June 30 and September 30.
If we look at where we're at today, whether it's criticized, classified, charge-offs and nonperforming, we're actually
better at September 30 than what our models would have assumed as of June 30 for this first quarter of that time
period. And so, we're actually seeing better credit quality migration than would have been expected and
contemplated as part of our June 30 reserves. Mark [ph] can cover (46:41) the areas of that migration.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
Mark W. Midkiff A
Chief Risk Officer, KeyCorp
Yes, I'd echo that, Don, better than what we would have forecasted on the migration. And the drivers really are
the same things you're seeing in the focus areas in the disclosure. So, the consumer businesses, so consumer
discretionary, consumer services, the oil and gas business, some transportation, so it's really those are the drivers
that we see.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay. All right. Thanks. And then another question just on credit. It sounds like you're confident in the adequacy
of where the reserve stands now. So if charge-offs continue to rise as they did this quarter, for the fourth quarter
and beyond, would you expect that you would underprovide for those charge-offs?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
We've talked before about how the CECL works. And really, there's three drivers to it. One is, what's the
economic outlook. And so, I would hesitate to try to speculate or guess as to what that will be as of December 31,
given the environment that we're in and given how election is right around the corner as well, but that will clearly
impact the overall reserve levels.
And if I look at between the second quarter and the third quarter assumption sets, what we saw as far as that
economic outlook was that probably a better near-term performance was actually realized in the September
summary than what we would have assumed in the June summary. But longer term, the recovery rate was a little
slower. So unemployment levels remained a little bit higher in our September 30, and GDP level and recovery
was a little slower than what we would have assumed. And so, generally, maybe a little bit slight negative as far
as the overall impact there. And so first is economic outlook.
Second would be migration of the portfolio that, as we just talked about, that our loss models that are used for
CECL will assume that the portfolio goes through a specific migration based on the economic outlook. And so if
you perform better or worse than that migration, you would see a need to either increase or decrease the
reserves.
And then the third would be – is that new loan production. And as we highlighted last quarter on the call, normally
for loan production, that would imply a provision expense of $80 million to $100 million a quarter versus the $160
million that we had this quarter. And so that's elevated compared to what we normally would have expected, as
far as just matching the loan production.
This quarter, what we did do was to actually supplement what our quantitative models would have produced. And
so we added about $100 million between model overlays and also our qualitative assessment to the reserve to
bump up the reserves, just to make sure that we weren't recognizing too quickly the benefit of that migration, and
given the economic uncertainty that we're still facing right now. And so we think that was a prudent thing for us to
do. And we would have seen a lower level of provision, if we had not had done that this quarter.

Operator: Our next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Just in simple terms, why did you guys build reserves this quarter when many of your peers didn't? And where
do you think charge-offs, 49 basis points in the third quarter, peak and when do you think that happens?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. As far as the build in the reserve, I'd say it's fairly modest. And what we wanted to do was to make sure that
we weren't taking credit too early as far as the better than expected migration and also uncertainty on the overall
economic outlook. And so we felt that was appropriate to do.
Last quarter, we were being challenged as to whether or not our reserves were adequate. And we still are a little
low compared to peers as far as the reserves. And so that also influenced our assessment as to whether or not
we wanted to show reserve declines this quarter. And so we decided to go ahead and layer in on top of that some
additional model overlays and also qualitative reserves.
And so if you look at our total allowance for credit losses, Mike, it's at 1.88%. And if our average loan life is
roughly three years, that would imply charge-offs of around 60 basis points for some time. And I would say that as
we take a look at what our projections would have, we'd probably see some continued slight increases through
the middle of next year. And that would probably be the peak and then start to trail off again.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
So the peak would be like double or 70 or 80 basis points or any – I mean, I know – not many have given this, but
some have.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. I would say that it would be elevated a little bit from the 49 basis points. And we're talking about 55 to 65
basis points next quarter. So they go up a little bit from there, yes, but probably not a doubling from here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then the tougher question. So 2% of your loans are in forbearance and you said that's down
significantly. I guess that's 1.6% commercial, 2.3% consumer. If the music were to stop today because at some
point, you'll stop with the forbearance, what would be the impact on charge-offs and revenues?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
As far as charge-offs, I mean, one, we've already built in extra reserves for those loans that are in forbearance.
And so I think that's an appropriate consideration there. Two, if we look at the forbearance, and especially on the
commercial side, we're not just automatically granting forbearance. We've got to work with the customer and
make sure that we understand that this truly is a bridge for them on an interim basis and this isn't just a delay of
the inevitable. And so we are taking a look at credit quality without the benefit of that forbearance.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
I would say that on the consumer side, even though we have loans in forbearance, we're still very happy with the
quality of that underlying customer base that still have consumers that will eventually have the capacity to
continue to repay, that the collateral values for those products, whether it's home equity or residential mortgage,
are still quite strong. And so I wouldn't see that as a significant impact as far as either charge-offs or P&L for us as
those would mature. Mark, I don't know [ph] if you have any thoughts here (53:16)...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark W. Midkiff A
Chief Risk Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah, I'd say the same. And they do continue to come down. And we – also, what rolls off of – and exits, we're
seeing really high current rates, sort of 96%, 97% or higher. So seeing good performance.

competitors are under pressure – the industry is a little under pressure, what's the appetite?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
So as you know, we've been successful in acquiring niche businesses. And I think you can expect us to continue
to look at those. I'm really proud of the fact that we've been able to acquire born digital companies and
successfully integrate those, investment banking boutiques and integrate those. In terms of whole-bank
acquisitions, that's not really a focus of ours, Mike, we think we have everything we need to be successful. And
we think the right strategy is to execute our strategy to create value for the shareholders.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
Sure can. As far as the percentage increase, I would say the majority of the increase in that cards and payments-
related revenues was related to the prepaid card activity. Keep in mind also that we saw a similar increase in the
expenses linked quarter. And so the earnings risk for that is nominal as far as changes on that front.
As far as the activity for other card balances that – I would say that in the third quarter, we're seeing levels that
are fairly comparable to what we would have seen as far as spend on both the credit card and debit card. And
maybe transaction counts might be a little lower on debit card but the average ticket size is a little higher. And so
we're seeing getting closer to return to normal. I don't know, Chris, if you have any other thoughts there?

Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
No. Obviously, the mix has changed a bit there as people aren't traveling. People aren't going to restaurants. But
in the third quarter, it actually – the spend eclipsed that of the third quarter of last year.

All right. That's helpful. And my follow-up is on the deferral. On your $1.8 billion loans on deferral, how much of
that is on loans and COVID-19-exposed categories? And which industry are you seeing the highest re-deferral
rates? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Mark, do you have thoughts on that as far as – I would say, generally, that we're seeing a higher percentage in
those industries, but I don't know that there's any one [indiscernible] (56:25)...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark W. Midkiff A
Chief Risk Officer, KeyCorp
Not one that kind of stands out. And the re-deferral rates are – it's been in the kind of 15% range. So it's been
very, very low.

Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thanks. Thanks for squeezing me in. A couple follow-ups. First, here on the prepaid card income, you just
mentioned, the majority of the increase or almost all the increase cadence comes from that and the payments. Is
it fair to say that – it seems like your guidance for fourth quarter still includes pretty elevated level of prepaid

income and associated expenses. Is that correct? And can you just help us understand what kind of magnitude is
sort of baked into the fourth quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
I would say both the revenues and expenses remain elevated compared to normal levels, but down slightly from
what we would have seen in the third quarter. And so...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
There's a number of different things would drive both the revenue and expenses and we're seeing some of the
activity levels for those areas declined slightly in our outlook.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And secondly, I wanted to go back to the earlier question on hedges. I want to clear if you blessed Bill
Carcache's math or not. But based on that, can you just help us understand what is the sort of NII protection that
you're currently getting from your swap?
Just doing the math on slide 20, seems like it's in the neighborhood of about, call it, $500 million or, say, $130
million a quarter with a weighted average maturity of 3.4 years. So I guess, it rolls off over six, seven years, which
would imply sort of [ph] $80 million to $100 million (58:30) headwind annually from just – and I know this is
assuming no replacements and no other stuff you can do to offset it. But, I mean is that math broadly correct that
that's kind of the protection you're getting today and the runoff will provide something close to, say, $80 million,
$90 million, $100 million headwind annually or is that completely off?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Well, keep in mind that as we look at our loan portfolio, 70%-plus is variable. That's different than many of our
peers. And so, if you look at the swap book that we have, it really is to shift the actual net adjusted position to be
more in line with peers as far as that overall fixed percentage.
I would say, as far as the math, I think we're right around 27 basis points of our margin this quarter relates to the
benefit from interest rate swaps. And so the math probably isn't too far off. I'd have to go back and recalculate all
the numbers to make sure that we're in sync there. But, that is, if you just look at that one light item, would be
correct.
But keep in mind that we were also seeing a corresponding reduction in our net interest income coming from
those commercial loans that are LIBOR-based, that we use these to hedge that impact. And so, it's difficult to say,
just looking at that one line item, what's the impact. But you have to look at the overall balance sheet and the
moves on not only the asset side but the liability side to see the true impact is going forward.
