Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
We'll go through the same format as usual. I'm going to give some general comments regarding our results, turn it
over to Dave for a more detailed analysis of other income, other expenses and taxes. Back to me for some
summary, comments and thoughts about the future, and then time for questions.
I'd like to first take a little walk down memory lane. As we enter the Roaring Twenties, I'd like to think, as we call
them now, and I think it's appropriate to take a second to look at our accomplishments over the last decade. As
we have always been a company that manages for the long term, I find it refreshing not always to concentrate on
the last quarter, look at an entire body of work over that longer term. I can actually say with confidence that our
franchise has really never ever been in better position or more valuable.
Over that 10-year period, net income grew from $73 million in 2009 to $356 million in 2019, a 17% net of
compound annual growth rate. 9 out of 10 years were record earnings with only 2010 not achieving record status.
Earnings per share tripled during that period of time with a little over $2, now over $6 resulting in 11% CAGR.
Tangible book value grew at 8% CAGR from $23 in 2009 to almost $50 in 2019. Assets and deposits have both
grown at 12% compound annual growth rate. Assets tripled during that timeframe from $12.2 billion to $36.6
billion, and the deposits from $10 billion to $30 billion.
Loans grew from $8.4 billion to $26.8 billion from year-end 2009 to 2019. Non-performing assets as the percent of
assets have come down every year since 2009 and ended this year at a low of 0.36% total assets. Given our $6
run rate in EPS and our track record, consistent growth and all fundamental financial results, it kind – it just drives
me nuts to look at the discount that we traded at relative to the market.
Our goal for 2020 and beyond is to continue this history of good growth in all major statistics. Barring material
future decreases – material decreases in rates, this $6 per share run rate is kind of a line in the sand for us and
the basis for growth – our future growth aspirations.
Now, onto the quarter; the fourth quarter net income all in all is somewhat disappointing, but reasonable
considering the interest rate environment headwinds that we experienced. I actually think since 9/11 we're going
to have a period of what I consider a normal yield curve for maybe an aggregate of 10 to 12 months. I don't really
know what the new normal is anymore. But it makes a little bit hard to manage our balance sheet. But I think
we've done a pretty good job over those 10 years.
Net interest income and net interest margin, as you know, they then fell 20 basis points to 3.19% as earning asset
yields fell 28 basis points and interest expense fell 11 basis points, the net free funds ratio was down by 3 basis
points. All these differences are a direct result of the LIBOR market and the yield curve [ph] targeting some
(04:45) material changes, which should be a good basis for us going forward.
Loan yields fell 24 basis points. Loans held-for-sale fell 30 basis points. The liquidity management yields fell 23
basis points. Drop in liquidity management yield was due to the $747 million increase in average liquidity
management assets due to a good growth during the quarter. This increase is yet to be invested in the longer-
term securities as evidenced by our liquidity management duration staying constant at a little rough four years.
Investing these assets on securities – longer-term securities should assist as part of the margin contribution going
forward. Our goal is to maintain an approximate six-year duration on liquidity management assets, we have some
opportunity there.
Our loan to deposit ratio remained at the high end of our estimated 85% to 90% range in the quarter at 89%,
down from 90% in the previous quarter end. And interest expense growth deposit expense decreased 10 basis

points in the quarter. Generally, it takes time to decrease deposit rates. And we are actively and aggressively
working to decrease the cost of funds at our deposit base. So, there's opportunity here also.
Our overall cost of funds and total interest-bearing liabilities was also down 11 basis points. On the net interest
income front, we recorded a decrease of about $3 million. The margin decrease was a primary result of this
decrease and was mitigated by overall asset growth. The full year basis net interest income was up approximately
$100 million.
Going forward, depending on the rate environment, further rate cuts are actually [ph] not (06:27) going to be
appreciated. We expect the margins to be under decreased pressure due to our ability to deploy liquid
management assets in the higher yielding securities and aggressive deposit cutting costs – cost cutting where we
can. We know LIBOR is again down this quarter. We think we've been aggressive. And hopefully, our plan is to
have a decrease in – any future decrease in assets offset by liabilities and the cost of liabilities going down. So,
again, we think we're kind of at a good point here, barring an overall shift down materially in a quick shift down
materially in the market.
Net interest income should grow as a result of the above, plus additional gain in franchise growth. We strongly
believe the current 3.19% should be a baseline of which we can build and grow especially we can maintain our
historical growth asset growth rates in 2020.
Other income and other expense, Dave will be reviewing these in detail a bit later, but some high level remarks.
Net overhead ratio stood at 1.53% for the quarter, 1.57% for the year. If one were to eliminate the MSR valuation
adjustments and acquisition-related expenses, would it be a bit below our 1.50% goal as an organization? If we
were to omit the negative MSR valuations for the year, we would achieve approximately 7% earnings growth for
the year.
Under the balance sheet where assets grew $5.4 billion over the year, $1.7 billion over September, and [ph]
during assets about $1.541 billion (08:11) in the quarter and $4.8 billion for the year. And loans were up $1 billion
for the quarter and $3 billion for the year. So, good loan growth across the board with the start of the year with a
little bit of a head start with almost $800 million of average assets – the average assets being below quarter-end
assets. So, that's a good thing. So, the net of loans held-for-sale grew $1.1 billion or 16.8% for the quarter and
approximately $3 billion or 12.5% for the year.
Fourth quarter included approximately $582 million in acquired loans. Real estate loans, commercial and
residential grew $707 million in total. Premium finance loans, life and P&C grew $271 million, and commercial
loans increased by $90 million. Loan pipelines continue to remain strong across the board. We expect to continue
growing loans at high-single digits [ph] as a percent (09:21) consistent with prior periods. Deposit front; was
another great deposit growth quarter of $1.4 billion. That's after returning $200 million [audio gap] (09:32)
acquisition accounted for approximately half of this net growth in deposits.
Core deposits non-brokered comprise 97% of total deposits. I think we have the best core franchise in our market.
Continued good growth is at the heart of our plans for 2020 and beyond. Good credit front as mentioned, credit
metrics returned to historical norms. Non-performing stayed constant and totaled about 0.44% outstanding, which
is low as they've been in any recent time in the past. Same could be said for non-performing assets. As I said
earlier, it's decreased to 0.36% of assets.
Net charge-offs were $12.7 million, including $5.3 million in charges previously reserved for. Despite our second
quarter blip, the net charge-offs for the year totaled just around 20 basis points, a good number in anyone's

measure and more in line with what you would expect from us at Wintrust. We continue to cull the portfolio for
prime assets. High leverage deals are not welcome here anymore, and we are moving them out as we can. But
we want to find them before they become problems of moving about and moving them out on an expeditious
basis.
I'm going to turn over to Dave who will provide some additional details on our income and expense. He will also
give you detail on the long-awaited CECL or the convoluted – I call it the convoluted – I'll tell you later in the call.
Now, Dave, go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David L. Stoehr
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
All right. Thanks, Ed. As normal, I'll briefly touch on the other non-interest income and non-interest expense
sections, as well as the convoluted CECL standard that Ed referred to. On the non-interest income section, our
wealth management revenue increased $1 million to a record $25 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $24
million in the third quarter of this year, and up 10% from the $22.7 million recorded in the year ago quarter.
Overall, we believe the fourth quarter of 2019 was another solid quarter for wealth management segment,
benefiting from good customer growth and a strong equity market.
Mortgage banking revenue declined by 6% or $3 million to $47.9 million in the fourth quarter from $50.9 million
recorded in the prior quarter and was up a strong 98% from the $24.2 million recorded in the fourth quarter of last
year. The decrease in this category's revenue from the prior quarter resulted primarily from seasonally lower
levels of loans originated and then sold during the quarter from basically lower purchased home activity, offset
somewhat by an MSR adjustment during the fourth quarter, which was positive versus the negative fair value
adjustment recognized on MSRs in the prior quarter.
The company originated approximately $1.2 billion of mortgage loans for sale in the fourth quarter. This compares
to $1.4 billion of originations in the third quarter of this year and $928 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The
mix of loan volumes originated for sale that was related to refinance activity was approximately 60% compared to
52% in the prior quarter. So, the refinance volume increased during the quarter and acted to mitigate the
seasonally lower purchased home activity.
Table 16 of our earnings release provides a detailed compilation of the components of origination volumes by
delivery channel and also the mortgage banking revenue, including production revenue, MSR capitalizations,
MSR fair value and servicing income. We currently expect originations in the first quarter of 2020 to be stronger
than the first quarter of 2019, given the continuation of the refinance activity. But the originations are expected to
be less than the fourth quarter. So, somewhere between first quarter last year and fourth quarter of last year is
where we currently expect the volumes to be.
Other non-interest income totaled $14 million in the fourth quarter, down approximately $3.5 million from the
$17.6 million recorded in the third quarter of this year. The primary reasons for the low revenue in this category
include $2.6 million of lower swap fee revenue and $2.6 million less of income from investments and partnerships.
These investment and partnerships are primarily related to SBIC investments to support our CRA goals. This
category of revenue generally fluctuates as a result of the two revenue sources I just talked about and has
averaged about $14.6 million over the past five quarters. So, despite falling from a very good third quarter level,
the current quarter is roughly on average with the last five quarters.

Turning to non-interest expense categories; non-interest expense totaled $249.6 million in the fourth quarter, up
approximately $15 million or 6% from the prior quarter. A number of factors contributed to the increase. The first
severance payments, professional fees and data processing conversion charges related to the recent acquisitions
totaled approximately $2.4 million during the fourth quarter compared to $1.3 million in the third quarter.
Approximately $2.8 million of other normal operating expenses related to the STC and Countryside Bank
acquisitions were incurred during the quarter, and we would expect that this amount would reduce over time as
we continue to integrate these acquisitions into our infrastructure.
Costs associated with terminating two small pension plans that we inherited with prior acquisitions totaled
$487,000. And that should be the end of any cost associated with pension plans as we no longer have any. There
was a $750,000 increase in legal settlement charges in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter as
management deemed it more cost effective to settle certain litigation matters than to hinder into potentially lengthy
court proceedings.
$1.7 million of additional expense was accrued as additional contingent purchase price payments related to prior
mortgage operation acquisitions. We have contingent consideration on our mortgage acquisitions, and we have to
make our best guess upfront. And if the mortgage market is better, you may have to record additional expense.
But if it was worse, it could come in as income. Given the stronger mortgage market, we recorded an accrual for
$1.7 million for what we think would be additional contingent purchase price payments on those mortgage
operations. And we also had $1.1 million of less rebates on FDIC insurance assessment this quarter compared to
the prior quarter.
I'll talk more significant – the more significant categories now. The salaries and employee benefit category
increased approximately $4.9 million in the fourth quarter from the third quarter of this year. Salary expenses
accounted for almost all the increase was approximately $4.8 million resulting – was up approximately $4.8 million
resulting from approximately $1.4 million of staffing costs related to the STC Capital Bank and Countryside Bank
acquisitions completed during the fourth quarter, plus an additional $1.4 million of severance accruals, and then
also normal growth of the company accounted for the growth in that category.
Additionally, employee benefits expense was approximately $159,000 higher in the current quarter than the prior
quarter. And this was really all due to the $487,000 cost associated with terminating the two pension plans.
Equipment expense totaled $14.5 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $1.2 million as compared to the third
quarter. The increase in the current quarter relates primarily to expenses associated with two acquisitions closed
during the quarter and increased software depreciation and licensing as we continue to invest in information
technology, information security and the newly-implemented Bank Secrecy Act software, which enhances our
ability to monitor for BSA-related activities as we continue to grow.
Occupancy expense totaled $17.1 million in the fourth quarter, increasing $2.1 million from the prior quarter. The
increase was due to the costs associated with new locations of the acquired institutions, new branch locations
and increased real estate tax assessments. Data processing expense increased approximately $1 million in the
fourth quarter compared to the prior quarter to primarily to approximately $558,000 of conversion charges related
to the STC Capital Bank system conversion, and additional operating costs of data processing related to the two
acquisitions that we closed during the quarter and just general growth of the franchise during the quarter.
FDIC insurance expense was up $1.2 million in the fourth quarter compared to the prior quarter. As you know, the
FDIC insurance assessment regulations provided that after the reserve ratio reach 1.38%, the FDIC would

automatically apply small bank credits to reduce small banks' regulatory – regular deposit insurance assessments
up to the full amount of their assessments or to the full amount of their credits, whichever is less.
The reserve ratio reached [ph] 1.40% (19:25) on June 30 and stayed above the required threshold on September
30. And since each of our subsidiary banks are less than $10 billion in assets, each of them qualified for the
credit. Therefore, Wintrust Bank received credits of approximately $2.8 million in the fourth quarter, which was
approximately $1.1 million less than the $3.9 million of credits received in the prior quarter. And so, the accounts
were basically all of the quarterly increase in the expense. We believe we have about $200,000 of additional
assessment credit that could be applied in the future. We expect those to come in the first quarter generally, if the
reserve ratio remains above the required threshold.
Miscellaneous expense category totaled $26.7 million in the fourth quarter compared to $21.1 million in the third
quarter, an increase of approximately $5.6 million. The increase was impacted by the aforementioned legal
settlement charge and $1.7 million of expense accrued as the contingent purchase price payments on the
mortgage acquisitions that I discussed in this category was also negatively impacted by approximately $1.4
million of temporarily increased telecommunication charges as we're converting and upgrading our system-wide
telecommunication infrastructure and data network infrastructure. So, as we get off of one provider and go to
another provider and invest in that system, we've kind of got – overlapped on the two providers as we are
converting.
Other than the expenses categories just discussed, all the other expense categories were down on an aggregate
basis by just over $1 million from the third quarter of 2019. The net overhead ratio for the fourth quarter stood at
1.53%. On top of the acquisition-related and other uncommon charges mentioned at the beginning of my
comments, the net overhead ratio would have been below 1.5%. And we expect it to be below 1.5% for the year
2020.
And before I turn it back over to Ed, I'll briefly comment on the implementation of CECL. Our estimated increase in
the allowance for credit losses as a result of the implementation of CECL is in the 30% to 50% range. This range
reflects the uncertainty of economic forecasts that will be used to record the transition amount. Approximately
80% of the estimated increase is related to additions to the existing reserves for unfunded lending commitments
to the consideration under CECL of expected utilization by the company's borrowers over the life of those
commitments, as well as for acquired loans, which previously considered credit discounts. We expect relatively
modest increases in reserves on the remaining legacy book.
As to future provisioning, it will continue to be impacted by charge-offs, loan growth, the mix of loan growth, the
macroeconomic environment and many other factors. If the macroeconomic environment stays stable with our
current assumptions and if we have loan growth similar to prior quarters and charge-offs remain low, then I expect
our quarterly provision for credit losses to be in the $10 million to $15 million range. But I caution that CECL
accounting standard may cause significant volatility in the future and that estimate may be high or low. My
thoughts are that investors should focus on trends in non-performing loans and net charge-offs rather than
provision expense.
Under CECL, the provision expense will be sensitive to economic forecasts that may or may not ultimately have a
significant impact on the performance of the company's loan portfolio. So, as you may imagine, I'm not a big fan
of the new CECL accounting standard as the cost benefit aspect of it, in my opinion, is way out of whack, and I
believe it'll create a fair amount of volatility going forward. But we've got a great team that's worked hard on
implementing the new accounting standard, and we are ready to go.

Well, you're always good at being convoluted and shifting. Talks about the future. Although the rate environment
provides a plethora of challenges, we believe that we will navigate through the storm as we have in the past.
Overall, organic growth and acquisitive growth will be important as we need to grow this period of challenging rate
environment. Decreasing our cost of funds is obviously a priority, and we're all over it. Loan pipelines remain
strong. Interesting to note that we've been able to hold rates on our commercial premium finance business and
our leasing business. So, we should hold in well.
Deploying our liquidity management assets into longer-term better-earning assets is – part of what we're doing, as
I mentioned, taking our duration from four to six years will be helpful there. We have the expectation of a
continued strong mortgage market. We will be maintaining a positive gap, so as to knock in – we don't – last thing
we want to do is lock in this 3.19%, the 3.20% margin, we want to build off of that. But we're going to manage the
downside risk a little bit more accurately than we have in the past.
Credit's always a big question. It looks pretty good right now. We could you never know. We will never kick the
can down the road when it comes to credit. But so again, continued good core franchise growth will be the key.
We have closed the STC transaction and the Countryside transaction in the fourth quarter. Together, these deals
added close to $800 million in total assets.
Significant cost outs will happen, but they're going to take a few quarters to achieve. We have converted STC and
we're starting to – we'll close three branches there over a period of time, possibly four, that should start happening
in the first and second quarter. We'll be converting Countryside in the second quarter. There'll be some expenses
associated with that conversion but – then, we can start really taking the cost out of that, too. So, we should have
elevated costs from them in the first two quarters, but that should be decreasing.
We're not at a loss for future acquisition opportunities as the pipeline remains relatively full. We may – I'd like to
advise that maybe some larger transactions and those that we have historically been involved with are now more
of a possibility. So, we get bigger – I think we can look at bigger deals and I think the pricing on the bigger deals
might make more sense. We're seeing smaller deals being priced relatively high right now.
I know that credit union is being involved, but we've walked away from two or three in the past three weeks of the
quarter as a result of pricing being – going up on them or they could just be two drunks holding each other, I don't
know what's going on, but we'll find out in the long term. And God willing, we look forward to reporting record
results in 2020. As always, you can ensure of our best efforts in that regard.
Now, we can open up for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets.
Your line is now open.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks. Good morning.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
How are you doing, [indiscernible] (26:51)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good. Ed, you had some tongue twisters in the script. So, we're going to get you off script now. But your favorite
topic, the percentage margin, I guess, I was surprised to see the $1.1 billion in loan growth and net interest
income down a bit. I'm just curious if anything surprised you guys in that percentage margin print. And can you
talk a little bit more about your confidence in seeing that margin stabilize at the 3.19%, 3.20% number, because
things look good except for the fact that just that net interest income number didn't grow during the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I can understand that, but now we got about $700 million carry over to this quarter. So, on an average
basis, we weren't up that much. So, that's some of the issue there. So, you'll see that – I think the – with capital
we can grow net interest income next year, if we can maintain our steady growth rates.
As to deposits, I think you got LIBOR down 10 or 12, maybe 13 basis points really in this quarter. But we're
actively cutting expenses – our interest expense. So, we can bring that down by the same level knowing that our
premium finance loans on the commercial side and our $1.3 billion leasing portfolio continues to maintain the
rates and putting the liquidity to work, we hope that this is the base we can work off of. As our numbers show us, I
can see gradual improvement. But it keeps going down. I mean, it's hard to catch up. Well, eventually we will, but
right now it appears that if it just stays right where it is or drops 10 or 12 basis points a quarter, we can handle that
and use this, relatively speaking, as our benchmark to go forward.
Dave, you got a comment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David L. Stoehr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. No, I just – the key is, I think, going to be the 30-day LIBOR rate and whether that stabilizes or not, and the
Fed's rate, if they hold stable. If those two hold stable, then I think we can hold and we've got a good baseline and
the growth looks great – growth in net interest income. So, let's hope the yield curve steepens and the 30-day
LIBOR anchors out here.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. All right. And then, the other obviously bigger line item you talk about a lot is mortgage. And you had a
good mortgage quarter and this kind of 2x what you did a year ago sounds like you're still reasonably optimistic,
even though I think we all expect Q1 to be down a bit. But talk a little bit about what you're thinking about Q1. And
then, your ability – you've talked about the efficiency efforts in mortgage and your ability to get cost down if we do
see the seasonal slowdown and also some slowdown in the refi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David L. Stoehr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Well, I said in my comments that I think the mortgage production right now based on what we're seeing,
and you don't have full visibility for the quarter because the loans close sort of in that 30 to 40-day period. So, not
sure what the end of the quarter is going to look like and where rates will go in the next few weeks. But based
upon the application and the pipelines we have and the forecasts that we have, we think the production will be
somewhere between what we did in the first quarter of last year and what we did in the fourth quarter.
So, first quarter last year, we did $772 million – or, I'm sorry, $678 million worth of production. And we did $1.2
billion this quarter. My guess is it's somewhere in that $900 million plus or minus range, but that's our best
estimate right now. It could change if the rates fall and that refinance activity picks up even more. But my guess is
it's somewhere in that range.

Yeah. Well, we continue to work on that. As we've talked before, we have offshored some of the activities that are
non-customer facing, that are more unit priced. And so, we've turned that more into variable versus fixed rate.
And we continue to invest in the technology. So, I look at this as just an evolving improvement in the expense line
items as we continue to get better. There's not going to be one big quarter where expenses drop. We're just
getting better and better and better each quarter. So, we should see some continued improvement there.

Jon Arfstrom Q

Yes. Okay. And then, just one more and I'll step back. Just the comment about bigger deals, Ed, what do you
mean by that? Do you mean you'd consider an MOE? Do you mean just bigger than these sub-billion-dollar
transaction you've historically done? Just what do you mean by those comments. Thanks.

Edward Joseph Wehmer A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, obviously, we've concentrated on banks under $1 billion. We'll continue to look at that, but looking at banks
over $1 billion makes some sense to us also right now given that many of them are having kind of the same issue
as we are.

On the MOE standpoint, there's lots of opportunity that we don't generally comment on anything particular going
on or discussions that are going on or not going on. But you can imagine that in a year like this, everybody kind of
going through this – through this same sort of margin compression issues that some things might make some
sense, but things we never looked at before. I'd just stay on that. But who knows?

Operator: Our next question comes from Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. To start off with a question on the expenses. Dave, you ran through a lot of
the fourth quarter puts and takes to the expenses. Could you just provide some thoughts on the first quarter? Will
some of those expenses kind of disappear and – but you also have some seasonality that typically shows up in
the first quarter as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David L. Stoehr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Well, the FDIC credits of $2.8 million are going to go down to $200,000. So, there'll be a little headwind on
that. Certainly, the legal settlements of roughly $1 million this quarter, we don't expect to happen again. Pension
termination of $0.5 million, we don't expect to happen again. The contingent consideration on the mortgage
purchase price estimate, we think we've accrued that up, so we wouldn't expect that to happen again.
Acquisition-related charges of $2.4 million. As Ed said, we don't expect much in the first quarter, but we will
convert the Countryside deal in the second quarter, so we'll have some additional charges then when that
happens, but that should be mostly in the second quarter. And so, I mean, those were the big items that I don't
think should recur going forward.
You also note that on the non-interest income side, there is a $2.6 million swing between third quarter and fourth
quarter on swap fees that fluctuates quarter-to-quarter. We had abnormally good third quarter and a drop a little
bit in the fourth quarter given the rate environment and the like. But that very well could get better. And then, the
partnership investments, generally, those are positive. We had a couple of these SBIC investment firms have
rolled off some investments inside of their funds during the fourth quarter, which negatively impacted us. So, I
don't expect that to happen again. But that was a $2.6 million swing.
So, there's – between those two line items, there was $5.2 million swing that we don't expect to happen again sort
of in the non-interest income side of the equation. But those are volatile, and we just have to see what the market
value of those funds do and what the customer appetites are for sort of the capital market swap issues. But those
are the large items that I think you could sort of adjust for going forward.

I do think then that commissions expense if we're less in mortgage originations, as I spoke about in the first
quarter a little bit that the commission expense line item will come down, so that should help on the salary side,
too.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks. And then, Ed, just a follow-up on the M&A question, you said 1.35 times tangible book, is M&A really an
option at all given, call it, the currency, be it small banks or larger banks?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
It's all relative.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David L. Stoehr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. You'll just have to look at what the price is on their side. And some of these small deals are even larger
deals if you can get enough cost outs out of them. Then, if you look at the relative price and the cost savings, you
can make some of them potentially make sense.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. We're pretty good stewards of tangible book value. We don't give away the house and expect a 10-year
earn back or something. But hopefully, it won't be a 1.35 times in tangible book when you guys do your job out
there. Just kidding. So, you think at $6, I mean, $6 as a run rate per share, the average [indiscernible] (36:53)
which should be traded $75. I mean, we get this quarterly knee jerk reaction that everybody thinks the world is
coming to an end and nobody likes banks [indiscernible] (37:03), but we think the market is pretty good. We – this
rate environment, I think we can hold pretty steady and continue to grow.
As I said earlier, I think our franchise value has never been higher than it is right now. When you look at the 97%
core deposits and our great customer base, our growth, it's – we feel pretty good about that aspect of it. So, yeah,
you never know but – you never know. Done work is done work. But everybody else is in the same boat in terms
of book value – book value numbers and earnings numbers were only [indiscernible] (37:44) turns off the market.
Actually, we made up lots of cost cuts, too.
We can do acquisitions. We can do them well. We're not going to do anything stupid. So, done work is done work,
but to saying that the odds are that looking at larger deals might make more sense than some of the smaller deals
for the reasons I discussed earlier.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
Great. Thanks. Ed, you've talked about this $6 number a couple of times on the call today. I'm trying to get a
sense as $6 in 2019, is your expectation that you'll do better than that in 2020 barring any changes by the Fed? Is
that the message you're trying to send?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think it's a base we're going to build off of. I think if we can continue to grow at the rate we've been
growing at, we grew $4.5 billion organically and a $1 billion through acquisition last year. We'll just grow on $3
billion would be a good number for us. And hopefully, we can beat that – the earnings on that. If we can hold our
margins steady and keep the costs down that has a commensurate increase in expenses which we fully expect to
have, we'll get our overhead ratio in the 1.40s consistently, I think will be okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And just – maybe I missed it. I think you talked about your margin. Was the comment that the rate of
compression will abate from this quarter or that 3.19% will hold kind of from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, both. It just depends on where LIBOR continues to tank. It'll be hard to hold it. But I think that rate of
compression should slow down even it does go down more than we expect. But 10 basis points to 13 basis
points, we should be able to hold that just through the – through extending our maturities on our liquidity
management portfolio and continuing to cut our cost of funds. But any – like a quarter sudden drop of 35 basis
point, sudden drop would have a negative effect on us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
But as it stands today with LIBOR down, what, 10 basis points a quarter, you think you'll be in that ballpark of
3.19% for the first quarter if everything stay the same?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
Okay. Maybe the second question. We've seen a lot of banks given the revenue pressures kind of go to the
expense well. Obviously, you guys have a growth aspect to the story. But what are the thoughts of really
ratcheting up the efforts to cut costs while the revenue pressures are there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
We do that all the time. I mean, the efficiencies, we look for those all the time. We have a whole process here we
go through in terms of looking at process efficiencies. And a number of those are in the works right now. We
continue to go through that and work through it. But we also have to make investments in IT and technology that
we're doing, its people. So, we look at it all the time.
I don't know exactly what we could do to really do a drastic cut on expenses right now and continue to grow the
organization. We have to take what the market gives us. The market has given us good organic growth right now.
We got good momentum in our markets, good growth in our markets. If I can continue to grow the franchise and
keep in that overhead ratio at – in the 1.40s, then the margin will come around eventually. I mean, it will steady
and solidify at some point. It can't go down forever. Maybe it will go up some day.
But I've given up on interest rates. I don't think I've ever seen a period of time where full employment and 2.5%,
3% GDP growth and absolutely no inflationary pressures. How can – maybe you can explain to me someday,
Chris. But I do know that I do not want to – I do want to maintain a positive gap. I want to stay interest rate
sensitive, maybe not as much as we were; we've been whittling that back a little but because – I don't want to lock
in a 3.20% margin for the next five years. That doesn't make sense to me. So, let's see where it goes.
Dave, you got anything?

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Great. Thanks for taking my question. So, as I look at your loan growth in the past, acquisitions have always
played a part of that. As you look at kind of organic loan growth in 2020, what does that look like? Is that mid-
single digits higher than that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
I believe that a mid-single digit be a good number, 7%-8% – 6% to 9%, somewhere in that number right around
there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David L. Stoehr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Wintrust Financial Corp.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 22-Jan-2020
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And separately, on expenses, everyone's kind of taking shots at this question. And we're still going through
the adjustments. But is a low 2.40s per quarter base reasonable for expenses? How should we think about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David L. Stoehr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
There's so many variables out there depending on the mortgage market and the like. I think what we've tried to
do, Brock, in the past is sort of focus on the net overhead ratio so you can take the non-interest income
components and the non-interest expense components that are related to those. So, our goal in 2019 was sort of
1.55-ish range for the full year. As Ed had mentioned previously, we expect to get that down into the 1.40s. So, it
certainly will be below 1.50% based on what we're looking at now. So, we're going to get expense leverage out of
the system as we grow. And that's how we look at it. It's probably a little higher than the 1.40s.
If you take out some of the expenses we had this time, but add back in the FDIC credits, it's higher, but you're
going to come down on commissions in the first quarter. So, maybe you get into low 2.40s. But it really sort of
depends on the mortgage market and what that does. And so, it's hard – I hesitate to give a number because it
fluctuates based upon what we're doing in the revenue section on some of these commission-based businesses
that we have. So, I would focus more on are you coming in with net overhead ratios for the year less than 1.50%
in the 1.40s.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got you. And appreciate the guide on provisioning going forward 10% to 15% a quarter. How does that post-
CECL guide square with the $7.8 million, call it, $8 million in Q4?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David L. Stoehr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
In Q4, you have to remember, we had a charge-off that took away a specific reserve of $5 million. So, that was a
big part of the drop as we just didn't have that reserve for that one loan. So...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Going forward, we think, as Dave said earlier, looking at – I mean, CECL is going to be all over the board
on this. And if the guy at Moody's has a bad day or hangover or his hemorrhoids jacked up, he could take the
banking business down because everybody is using basically Moody's baseline as their basis for this. So, I think
you got to concentrate on net charge-offs and changes in specific reserves. That's what we're doing here in our –
when we evaluate people because, I mean, this thing could go up and go down based on their whims, so...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: Our next question comes from David Chiaverini with Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Hi. Thanks. I wanted to follow up on the NIM discussion. You mentioned about how you may be able to defend
the net interest margin at the 3.19% level by extending the duration from four years to six years. I was curious
how much in yield pickup do you expect with extending the duration.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David L. Stoehr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, I think you just have to look whatever the overnight rate is and compare that to what a Ginnie and a Fannie
rate is out in the marketplace. So, Ginnies and Fannies are in the mid-2s right now and the overnight rates are
mid-1s. So, maybe pick up 100 or so basis points. If you get some agencies, you could get closer to 3% if you
have callable agencies, so you do some mix there, but certainly pick up over 100 basis points. But it wasn't just
that. And so that plus the lowering of the deposit costs is what depends the margin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks for that. And you plan on extending that for the entire portfolio, like, roughly the $6 billion on the
securities?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, the liquidity management includes the overnight funds.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David L. Stoehr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. You have to look – if you look on our balance sheet, we've got interest-bearing deposits with banks of $2
million – $3.1 billion of available for sales and the $1.1 billion of held to maturity I mean, that's already invested.
So, we've got a little over $2 billion of overnight money that's available to be invested, plus whatever you could
get out of growth of the balance sheet on the deposit side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Got it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
The whole industry environment has been about a little over 1% after tax on any spread we picked up. I mean,
that's what we're looking at, why we'd hesitate a little in the past. But 1% after tax would be good, I mean by
1.25%, 1.30% pre-tax would be. But my goal is [indiscernible] (48:46), that's a goal.

Yeah. And that's why you haven't seen us put a ton of money into it yet because the long end just hasn't provided
that type of return. And we're hesitant to put $2 billion to work at spreads less than that all at once, and I've
always said that the day we do that is the day that long end will shoot to the moon. So, we'll leg into this thing
unless the long end really pops up dramatically.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thanks for that. And then, shifting to the loan growth and you mentioned about the mid- to high-single digit,
6% to 9%. I was curious, just how are your borrower – your commercial borrowers feeling nowadays? Do they
feel – in your discussions with them, do they feel better about the economy with the trade deal, the Phase 1 trade
deal getting done? I'm just curious as to what they're saying.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
They're all feeling pretty good. I mean, there's not a day that goes by that a reasonably privately owned middle
market company [ph] doesn't get (49:47) offered a hell of a lot of money. Basically, our C&I portfolio was stagnant
for the year. That didn't mean – we booked over $1 billion worth of loans, but they're much in payoffs through
some derisking. So, the portfolio, we got rid of highly leveraged deals.
We're getting out of that business and – but they're all feeling pretty good about what they're doing and they're all
– they may not be running that $40 million backlog that they had. So, they're all doing pretty well right now, and
they feel pretty good. But they're all – so, the money that's flying around out there right now from PE firms and
fintech companies, we're seeing a lot of paydowns. So, they have to work really hard just to stay steady in that
business.
Fortunately, if the fintech takes it over, we do maintain the deposit accounts. So, that's a good thing. So, let's say
the fintech takes over the loan. So we've got to be careful because I had a company that cut their legs up against
the wall in terms of leverage. So, it's a tough market from a lender standpoint. For the borrower standpoint, they're
all feeling pretty good, I would say.

Hey. Thanks for the question. I wanted to follow-up on the share buyback that you announced and just kind of get
your thoughts on how you were looking to deploy that. Obviously, a lot of discussion of M&A as well, but just kind
of how you're comparing and contrasting buying back your own stock versus looking at acquisitions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David L. Stoehr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Wintrust Financial Corp.

and contrast the deal flow and what sort of returns we think we can get off of those versus the buyback. We're not

big fans of diluting tangible book value. So, given the pipeline of deals we're looking at, we're going to see how
some of those flow through. And then, we'll watch the stock price movement and compare them. So, haven't done
anything to-date.
But we will continue to evaluate it versus the acquisitions. But we just compare the two and maybe that's why
we're losing some of the deals out there. As Ed said, some of them are – recently have had very high price
expectations and we're very judicious in what we do. We don't need to do a $2 billion, $3 billion, $4 billion, $5
billion bank if it cost too much. There's just no reason to overpay. We're looking at it for the long-term value of the
shareholder. So, if those don't pan out, then you would probably see us look a little harder at the stock buyback.

Edward Joseph Wehmer A

If the market – tell you what, it's just a matter. It's just numbers. As Dave said, if the deals we're looking at vis-à-
vis capital and where multiples are, I said we're at $66 a share return 11 times, 12.5 times multiple situations. So,
we were always good stewards of capital. We use it accordingly. But there comes a time where buying it back
was obviously better than buying a bank, so it all just comes down out of Graham, Dodd and Cottle basic finance
book.
