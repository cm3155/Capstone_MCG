items in our results this quarter, our core performance remained strong, and we continue to have one of the best
return on average tangible common equity ratios in our peer group at 21%.
During the quarter, we continued to experience elevated levels of check-related fraud. Our third quarter results
reflected an incremental $53 million in losses stemming from a second fraud scheme, which also began in the
second quarter but was unknown to us at the time. This game manifested itself in delayed returns and as a result,
has had a much longer tail. After adjusting our countermeasures to identify potential fraud instances more quickly,
the volume of new fraud claims has slowed.
Although difficult to project based on what we know today, we expect quarterly fraud losses to come down
significantly and to be approximately $25 million in the fourth quarter. Based upon the increases we are seeing in
check fraud across the industry, in fact, based on data we have, we indicated losses were up about 40% year-
over-year, we expect future fraud losses to normalize in the $25 million per quarter range in 2024. Although the
industry faces headwinds from lingering economic and regulatory uncertainty, we continue to benefit from our
strong and diverse balance sheet with solid capital, robust liquidity, and prudent credit risk management.
Our proactive hedging strategies have positioned us for success in any interest rate environment, and our
granular deposit base and relationship banking approach continue to serve us well. We've spent over a decade
de-risking our balance sheet and are well-positioned to manage through proposed regulatory changes without
significant impact to our business model. We remain committed to appropriate risk-adjusted returns, and now is
not the time to stretch for growth. We are focused on supporting existing customers where we have a relationship
and a proven history.
We have a great team with a proven track record of executing our strategy with focus and discipline. I'm confident
in our ability to adapt to the changing regulatory and economic landscape while continuing to generate top quartile
returns through the cycle.
Now, David will provide some highlights regarding the quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr.
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Average and ending loans remained relatively stable quarter-
over-quarter. Within the business portfolio, average loans were stable while ending loans decreased 1%. As John
mentioned, we are being judicious and reserving our capital for business, where we can have a full relationship.
Client sentiment varies across industries with some continuing to expect growth while others have a more muted
outlook. Commercial commitments are down 1% compared to the second quarter. Average and ending consumer
loans increased 1% as growth in mortgage and EnerBank was partially offset by declines in home equity and
runoff exit portfolios.
Subsequent to quarter-end, we executed the sale of our remaining GreenSky portfolio of approximately $300
million, which represents one of our consumer exit portfolios. The economics of the transaction are relatively
neutral but will create approximate 14 basis points of incremental charge-offs in the fourth quarter, offset by the
related reserve release. Looking forward, we expect 2023 ending loan growth to be in the low-single digits.
From a deposit standpoint, the modest deposit declines were in line with expectations, largely driven by late cycle
rate-seeking behavior. We continue to experience remixing out of non-interest bearing or NIB products and ended
the quarter with NIB representing 35% of total deposits. Given the current rate environment, we expect the

percentage to ultimately level off in the low 30% range. While some customers find alternatives and other
investment channels outside of Regions, many are moving to our CDs and money market accounts.
We also continue to provide off-balance sheet opportunities through our Wealth Management platform and in the
Corporate Banking segment via money market mutual fund solutions. In the case of corporate clients, overall
liquidity under management has remained stable quarter over quarter-over-quarter. Acquisition and retention of
high primacy and operating relationships are strong, reflecting our focus to sustain and extend our deposits'
advantage through cycles.
Looking forward, the higher rate environment, the tightening Federal Reserve, and heightened competition will
likely continue to constrain deposit growth and pressure costs for the industry through year-end and into early
2024. Accordingly, we expect deposits to be stable to modestly lower in the fourth quarter, and we expect
continued remixing into interest-bearing categories.
So, let's shift to net interest income. Net interest income declined by 6.5% in the third quarter, reflecting the
anticipated normalization from elevated net interest income and margin levels back towards a sustainable longer-
term range. The decline is driven by deposit cost normalization, the start of the active period on $6 billion of
incremental hedging, as well as a onetime leverage lease residual value adjustment.
As the Federal Reserve nears the end of its tightening cycle, net interest income is supported by elevated floating
rate loan and cash yields at higher market interest rates and fixed rate asset turnover from the maturity of lower
yielding loans and securities. Deposit costs continued to increase through a combination of re-pricing and
remixing, increasing the cycle-to-date interest-bearing deposit beta to 34%.
Historically, this behavior persists for a few quarters after the Fed stops moving interest rates. While we expect
the pace of re-pricing to moderate, a higher federal funds rate over an extended period will cause remixing from
low-cost deposits to persist, ultimately pushing deposit betas higher than previously anticipated. We now project
the cycle-to-date beta to increase to near 40% by year-end.
Regardless, we remain confident that our deposit composition will provide a meaningful competitive advantage for
Regions when compared to the broader industry. If the Fed remains on hold, fourth quarter net interest income is
expected to decline approximately 5%, driven by continued deposit and funding cost normalization and the
beginning of the active hedging period on another $3 billion of previously transacted forward starting swaps.
Net interest income is projected to grow approximately 11% in 2023 when compared to 2022. As we look to 2024,
higher rates for longer likely extends the period of deposit cost and mix normalization. We expect net interest
income trends to stabilize over the first half of the year and grow over the back half of the year. The balance sheet
hedging program is an important source of earnings stability in today's uncertain environment. Hedges added to-
date create a net interest income profile that is well-protected and mostly neutral to changes in interest rates
through 2025. While we do not anticipate adding meaningfully to the hedging position over the coming quarters,
we continue to look for opportunities to add protection at attractive rate levels in outer years through the use of
derivatives or securities.
During the third quarter, we added $1.5 billion of forward-starting swaps and $500 million of forward starting rate
collars. So, let's take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted non-interest income decreased 2% from the
prior quarter as modest increases in mortgage and wealth management income were offset by declines primarily
in service charges and capital markets. The increase in mortgage income was driven by higher servicing income
associated with the bulk purchase of the rights to service $6.2 billion of residential mortgage loans closed early in

the quarter. Service charges declined 7%, reflecting the run rate impact of the company's Overdraft Grace feature
implemented late in the second quarter.
Based on our experience to-date, as well as our expectation for another record year in Treasury Management, we
now expect full-year service charges of approximately $590 million. Total capital markets income decreased $4
million. Excluding the impact of CVA and DVA, capital markets income decreased 13% sequentially as increases
in M&A fees were offset by declines in other categories. We had a negative $3 million CVA and DVA adjustment
during the quarter versus the $9 million negative adjustment in the prior quarter. With respect to the outlook, we
now expect full-year 2023 adjusted total revenue to be up 5% to 6% compared to 2022.
Let's move on to non-interest expense. Adjusted non-interest expense decreased 2% compared to the prior
quarter and includes the previously noted elevated operational losses. Excluding the incremental fraud
experienced in both the second and third quarters, adjusted non-interest expenses increased 1% sequentially.
Salaries and benefits decreased 2%, driven primarily by lower incentives and payroll taxes while other non-
interest expense increased 12%, driven primarily by a $7 million pension settlement charge. We remain
committed to prudently managing expenses in order to fund investments in our business. We will continue to
refine our expense base, focusing on our largest categories, which includes salaries and benefits, occupancy, and
vendor spend.
We expect full year 2023 adjusted non-interest expenses to be up 9.5%. Excluding the $135 million of incremental
operational losses experienced in the past two quarters, we expect adjusted non-interest expenses to be up
approximately 6% in 2023 when compared to 2022.
From an asset quality standpoint, overall credit performance continues to normalize as expected. Net charge-offs
increased 7 basis points to 40 basis points due to elevated charge-offs related to a solar program we've since
discontinued at EnerBank as well as lower commercial recoveries versus the second quarter.
Non-performing loans, business services criticized loans, and total delinquencies also increased. Non-performing
loans as a percentage of total loans increased 15 basis points in the quarter due primarily to a large collateralized
information credit. Provision expense was $145 million or $44 million in excess of net charge-offs. The allowance
for credit loss ratio increased 5 basis points to 1.70%, while the allowance as a percentage of non-performing
loans declined to 261%. The increase to our allowance is due primarily to adverse risk migration and continued
credit quality normalization, as well as a build in qualitative adjustments for incremental risk in certain portfolios,
including office, multifamily in select markets, and EnerBank.
It's also worth noting the outcome of the most recent Shared National Credit Exam is reflected in our results. The
allowance on the office portfolio increased from 2.7% to 3.1%. Importantly, the vast majority of our office exposure
is in Class A properties located primarily within the Sunbelt and non-gateway markets. Overall, we continue to feel
good about the composition of our office book and do not expect any meaningful loss in this portfolio. We expect
net charge-offs will continue to normalize. Including this quarter's charge-offs but excluding the 14-basis-point
impact on our fourth quarter GreenSky loan sale, we expect full-year 2023 adjusted net charge-off ratio to be
slightly above 35 basis points.
In the third quarter, two anticipated notices of proposed rulemaking were issued. While we plan to provide
feedback through the comment process on both, we're well-positioned to absorb the ultimate impacts without
major changes to our business.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
With respect to Basel III Endgame, as proposed, we estimate a low- to mid-single digit increase in risk-weighted
assets under the expanded risk-based approach in addition to the phase-in of AOCI into regulatory capital.
Regarding minimum long-term debt, we estimate a need to issue approximately $6 billion of long-term debt over
the course of several years. We view this amount to be manageable, resulting in a modest drag on earnings.
Importantly, the proposal provide clarity on the evolution of the regulatory environment and support our decision
to maintain our common equity Tier 1 ratio around 10% over the near term, as this level should provide sufficient
flexibility to meet the proposed changes along the implementation timeline while supporting strategic growth
objectives. Despite the current macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, as well as the continued evolution of
the regulatory framework, we expect that share repurchases will resume in the near term.
And finally, we have a slide summarizing our expectations, which we have addressed throughout the prepared
comments. With that, we'll move to the Q&A portion of the call.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank
you. Our first question comes from line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to start out just on the NII trajectory. When
we talk about NII stabilizing in the first half of 2024, I guess we might be suggesting that it could continue to
compress a bit after the fourth quarter's dip. So maybe just thinking if you could help us to sort of size the – any
potential pressure beyond year-end 2023 and then additionally, your thoughts on what would allow it to resume
growing in the second half of next year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Hey, Scott, this is David. So, you're right. You will see some pressure in the fourth quarter in particular as
we see a continued remixing of non-interest-bearing deposits going into interest-bearing given higher for longer
rates and due to the fact that we have $3 billion of notional interest rate swaps that become live in the fourth
quarter through that. So that alone cost about $20 million in the – in NII. So you'll see an adjustment not as big as
you just saw relative to net interest margin decline, but you'll see some decline in the fourth quarter. When we get
to the third quarter, while we do have an additional $2.5 billion of interest rate swaps that become live then, we
think the remixing will start slowing. We think there is somewhere between $3 billion and $5 billion worth of
remixing of non-interest-bearing deposits into interest-bearing, and that's going back in studying our consumers in
particular and how much they had in their accounts relative to their spend and where that $3 billion to $5 billion
gets you back to where they were from a pre-pandemic standpoint, so we have confidence that we should see
this starting to slow after the fourth quarter.
There will be, like I said, a little pressure in the first quarter because of the new derivatives coming on. That
number will affect us about $10 million to $15 million in the first quarter then we don't have any more after that.
So, we start stabilizing from there. And when we get to the second half of the year, we can start to grow. If I kind
of cut to the chase on the Endgame, we think, after all is said and done, we can support – our margin should
bottom out around 350, perhaps a bit higher than that. So you're not going to see the kind – you can't take the

change that you just saw and continue to extrapolate that all the way through the end of the second quarter. It –
you'll have a bigger change in the fourth, a smaller change in the first, and negligible change in the second
quarter.
So, the balance sheet – what's important in all that is the balance sheet continues to re-price. We have about $15
billion worth of fixed rate securities and loans that re-price and the front book, back book impacts are about 350
basis points, and we continue to have – have had that. The problem is it's been overwhelmed by the move of non-
interest-bearing deposits into interest-bearing. And as I just mentioned, that should start to slow. And so, I think,
again, our margin bottoming out kind of in that 350 or slightly better than that is really the relevant point here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. Thank you for that color. And then, I guess just on the notion of deposits and betas, I know we're
thinking about a 40% beta through the end of the year. But maybe thoughts on how things could trend into next
year if we indeed have just sort of some drag on pricing. How much more pressure could we see once rates
peaked and how [indiscernible] (00:20:49) might that level off?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think – so what's baked into what I just told you is that we would have a beta through the end of this year,
push it on 40%, maybe a little underneath that. And then, we go into perhaps the mid-40s into next year. And
again, that's just considering higher for longer. It starts to slow there again because we don't have as much
moving out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing. So, I think the – again, if we have rates even continue to
go up, we're slightly asset-sensitive and the re-pricing of our balance sheet starts to overwhelm the deposit
moves, and I think that's the – that's a piece that people might not be picking up on.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Maybe to ask a question on credit first, maybe just to clarify the implied a little bit above 35 for the year, which I
guess implies around 45 for the fourth quarter. So that pushes reported up to about 60 with GreenSky. I just
wanted to verify that.
And then, can you expand on the comments regarding what you're seeing in office, multifamily, and maybe what
happened with EnerBank, which I think you referenced higher charge-offs and exiting some parts of the portfolio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So you want me to start.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
So, yeah, I think that we'll see some increase. So, let's take the GreenSky piece out because that's going to be
noise, and we kind of announced that separate. Go back to kind of core charge-offs we said will be slightly higher
than 35. Call that a couple of points, maybe 37, which implies a fourth quarter in that 40-basis point charge-off
range. We will continue to see elevated charge-offs coming through EnerBank, for which we provided this past
quarter relative to our program that we discontinued. And so, we'll see that for a quarter or two. And that's
factored into the guidance that we've given you.
From an office standpoint, our office continues to decline even in October. I think we put that in...

David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
With respect to office, we've got about $1.6 billion in outstanding, to David's point that represents some decline
paydowns, refinances over the course of the last quarter. As we said before, about 39% of that portfolio is in
credits direct to single tenant credits. And the bulk of that is to investment-grade quality tenants. The balance of
our exposure, 61-plus percent are in multi-tenant credits. 63% of that is in the Sunbelt market. 92% is Class A.
We have, in total, about 100 borrowers. So, we are very much on top of the portfolio having ongoing
conversations with customers.
About 50% of our exposure matures this year and in 2024, so we're actively working that. One of the, I think, good
signs about the portfolio is that sponsors have contributed over the course of the last couple of quarters over $150
million to the projects. Most of them are unguaranteed. So those are commitments the sponsors are making to the
continued renewal and extension of those projects, the rightsizing of them. And as a consequence, we feel good
about our office exposure. We have one non-accrual, and that credit has been re-negotiated and is paying as
agreed currently.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. The rest of the portfolio, we did see some uptick in non-accruals. As David said, we're still guiding to 35 to
45 basis points of loss in 2024. We feel good about that. I think the portfolio is performing as we expected as it
normalizes, and that's occurring. Within EnerBank, we have a specific program that was associated with a single
vendor, and it effectively was what I would call kind of a Buy Now, Pay Later program where the customer entered
into an agreement to put solar equipment on their house. There was a period of time when that equipment would
be installed on the house. The customer did not make any payments. We exited that program in October of 2022
just based on our analysis of the risk-adjusted returns associated with it and the profile of the products. It was just
not something we wanted to continue.
Well, now, we're beginning to see those loans reach a point where customers are having to make payments, and
we are experiencing a little higher level of losses. But the losses within EnerBank are still below our expectations

for EnerBank in general, and it continues to perform better than at least consistent with, if not better, than we had
hoped when we made the acquisition.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. David, maybe a follow-up on expenses. I know there's lots of moving pieces in this scenario. I know you've
highlighted that you guys have been doing work on for a while, but just given the revenue headwinds that you're
likely to face in the beginning of the of the year, can you maybe just talk about what you're doing? And while I
know you might not be ready to give 2024 guidance, do you think you could potentially hold the line on expenses
and keep them relatively flat given the challenging revenue environment into 2024? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, I don't think it should be a surprise to anybody that revenue is going to be challenging. That's been out
there for a while. We've known it. And as a result, we started working on our expense management and our
continuous improvement program throughout 2023. This particular quarter, unfortunately, we had some things
that – the fraud, pension settlement. We had some equipment software costs that won't repeat at the level that we
had and some professional fees that we incurred that we don't think that will be repeated.
That being said, we're going to need to even double down on expense management for 2024. We're not going to
give you a guidance for that. But I think, suffice it to say, our reported number that we have for – we should be
able to have our number in 2024 to be underneath our reported number for 2023. How much, we'll give you
guidance as we get towards end of the year. But yeah, I think we should be able to be underneath that number.

John M. Turner, Jr. A

Good morning. On the fraud cost, if you could give us a little bit more color on that, were they running higher than
expected, than you had expected when you discussed them last quarter and why? Have they been persistent
given the issue that you discovered? And also, that $25 million per quarter of fraud cost that you flagged for 2024,
is that brand new, or was that already, to a degree, baked into your run rate expectation as you look at 2024, or is
this brand new given the longer-than-expected persistence of this issue?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So let me answer the second question first. So the $25 million per quarter is slightly higher than our
historical run rate. Fraud is increasing dramatically in the industry. We seem to be the one to call it out. It's hit us
very hard. To your first question, this was a different scheme this time than what we reported on last quarter. And
unfortunately, this scheme that they had, you don't know about until the banks on which the checks are written
notify you that that's not a good item, and it takes about 50 to 60 days before you know that. We can look at when
events occurred, and we can kind of see a pattern where we feel reasonably confident that we're not going to see
that kind of increase going forward from the schemes that we've seen. And, of course, we are putting in new
controls, we're putting in new technology, and it's very disappointing.
We have the $25 million, John, a bit higher, call it $5 million higher than we historically have had, because this is
just a big deal in the industry and so we want to be a bit conservative. We'll give you better guidance on expenses
including fraud when we get to reporting on 2024 expectations later. So, it's a tad higher but...

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay. All right, David, thank you. And then, I guess related to that, I mean, given this is the second visible fraud
issue to come up in as many quarters, are you getting any pressure incrementally from regulators to invest more
actively, like you said, around these new controls that you're putting in or any input there? And then separately, on
the capital front, you talked about buybacks likely to resume in the near term. Can you maybe give us some color
on the timing and potential magnitude there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Sure. So we won't talk about our relationships with our regulators, but fraud is our issue. If we have to have our
regulators tell us what to do with regards to fraud or anything else, we probably already missed that boat. So
that's not an issue, and we're highly disappointed in it. We're working hard. We have found some people that have
committed fraud. They've been put in jail. But again, the industry report we saw is up from $17 billion in 2022 to
$25 billion of fraud in 2024, thus far – in 2023, sorry. So it's affecting all of us, but it seems to have gotten us at a
kind of concentrated in these two quarters. And again, I feel confident we put in controls, and we'll be putting in
more, monitoring it going forward.
Relative to capital, yeah. So we're at 10.3% on common equity Tier 1. We now have seen the Basel III Endgame
proposal. We'll be going through and providing our comment letter on that as well as to that NPR. We feel
confident in kind of where we are relative to that and the implementation timeframe. Hopefully, we get a bit of a
reprieve on that. But even if we didn't, we feel that we're in a good place to be able to implement that without too
much harm. And there's no need for us to continue to let our capital to continue to increase. We accrete 20 to 30
basis points of capital every quarter. So if we did nothing, we would be pushing on 10.6%. That's just higher than
we need. And so, we think we can enter into buybacks as soon as we get out of the blackout period. And what we
left in our comments was, we would operate close or around that 10% CET1 number.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please proceed
with your question.

David Jackson Turner, Jr. A

Hey, Ebrahim.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey, good morning. I guess thanks for the color on CRE office. Just was wondering if you can talk about anything
beyond CRE office, particularly on multifamily in any of the Sunbelt states. We've read articles about oversupply
in some of these markets like Raleigh, Austin, etcetera. Just talk to us, one, in terms of exposure and if – whether
or not you're seeing softness within multifamily.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
So, Ebrahim, this is John Turner. We – our total exposure, I think, in multifamily just exceeds just above $3 billion.
It is a very diverse portfolio spread across 137 total submarkets, some number like that. We are – in terms of
concentrations, our top five exposures would be in cities that you would recognize: Dallas, Houston, Charlotte,
Raleigh, Orlando, Miami, places where we have just historically banked and have a presence. We don't have any
concentrations at all in any of those markets that would exceed – I think one exception, would exceed 5%, 6%. So
again, good diversity.
We are seeing some softening of rents, increasing costs associated with interest cost. About a little over 50% of
the portfolio is currently still under construction. So we expect that those construction projects to be completed
over the next 24 months to deliver out. We're not – while we're watching it closely, we really haven't seen any
adverse movement within the portfolio to speak of. And again, given the location of our projects, which are in
suburban markets, given the diversity of the distribution across geographies and the location primarily in the
Sunbelt, we feel good about our multifamily portfolio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. Thanks, John. And just a separate question in terms of the deposit beta outlook that you mentioned. How
are [indiscernible] (00:35:34) in term of the mix of customers? One, are you seeing [indiscernible] (00:35:40)
because of usage and that's driving [indiscernible] (00:35:44) talk about that to some extent?
And then, where do you CDs shaking out in terms of demand from borrowers – from deposit customers and
where CD mix could be 12 months from now if we don't get any rate cuts? Thanks.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2023
Yeah. You were breaking up there a little bit, but I think you were saying, what are we seeing in terms of
movement of NIB into CDs? So that's been the big change thus far for us. I think our CDs are right at 10% – just
under 10% of our book – of our total deposit book. That could grow. We do have money market offers that we're
working on. We want to be competitive. This remix has been really relegated to high-net worth customers that are
taking excess cash and putting it to work. And the reason we think that that remix is somewhere in the 3 to 5 to go
is because that customer base gets down to having the amount of cash in their account relative to the spend
pattern that they had pre-pandemic. And so, I think that happens by the end of next year – I mean, the middle of
next year.
As we think about where CD balances could be as a percentage of total deposits, maybe you pick up another
2%or 3% through that remix. And it really is dependent on how we think about other offers, money market, and
we're working on that. So there could be some mix in terms of how that 3% to 5% gets put to work but specific to
CDs, 2% to 3%.

Hi, Ken.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey, David, and hi, John. Just a quick question on the fee side. Very clear guidance for the fourth quarter. Just –
those service charges continue to come in much better $590 million for the year. Obviously, an implied lower exit
for the fourth quarter. Can – any line of sight in terms of like are we getting close to the leveling out periods here
on that service charges line in terms of – yeah, I know cash management has been outgrowing the other pieces,
but is this kind of the right level to use going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, I think from a fee standpoint, let's break down the two big pieces. So, our service charge number relative to
our 24-hour grace that was implemented in the middle of the second quarter, so we have a full quarter run rate on
that. We don't see that changing materially. We've been very proud of our Treasury Management team that's
done a good job of penetrating our commercial base, and we're seeing that hold up pretty well. So, I don't think
you should see the kind of decline in service charges that you just saw.
And the only thing that can affect us in fees would be there's a discussion going on with debit interchange, and
there's been percentages thrown out as to what that may mean. Just to level set with everybody, we have about
$310 million of debit per year. So whatever percentage change we have, you can do your own math on that.
We're not sure that that will even come out, but that's been mentioned. And so, we thought – I thought I'd just put
that out there.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. That's fair. And, David, can we just come back on the capital point? You're comfortably in that 10-plus zone
and there's obviously not a lot of current growth in the loan book. So just the push and pull of potentially re-
engaging in the buyback versus just keeping where you are and are left at a more uncertain environment. Kind of
just walk us through just what will be your thought process there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Sure. So as you know, we do an awful lot of stress testing. We do it constantly. We have our CCAR submission.
We have a midyear submission. We feel very confident that even if we go into a recession, which we are not
calling for, but even if we did, we'd have capital to withstand that. So it's all about optimization, Ken. And we think
that our – we still believe our operating range of $925 million to $975 million is the right range for regions based
on our risk profile. That being said, we've had an NPR. We have uncertainty going on. So we added 50 basis
points to give us the flexibility to adapt and overcome whatever environment is thrown at us. We don't see the
need to take 10.3% and let it ride up to 10.6%, 10.9% and keep going. And so, we're – that's what gives us
confidence. We don't have a big CRE book like others do. We don't have the risk that some others do. And we
have a very good engine. Our PP&R engine is among the strongest because of our deposit profile that we have.
And so, we have confidence that our earnings stream is going to get us where we need to be, and we think that
we have enough capital right now. So if we generate more, we can buy our stock back.

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. David, my first question is for you. I feel like given the reaction of the stock, I think it's probably
best if we completely de-risk consensus numbers, right? So forgive me for asking a super specific question. But
based on the disclosure of the swap book and everything that you're telling us about deposit behavior and higher
for longer, it seems like you could hit that sort of 350 trough in the first quarter, kind of stay there, maybe go up a
little bit and then get towards 360, if not, a little bit over 360 by 4Q 2023. So that gives you sort of a full year of,
let's call it between 350, 355 before 2024. Again, based on the forward curve, based on slow growth. Does that
feel fair?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A

We're not giving any guidance.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
We're not giving any guidance. You've done pretty well. You're understanding exactly how this works in terms of a
bigger downdraft in the fourth quarter than you'll see in the first part of the year and then be able to grow from
there. So directionally, you're exactly right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And then I'll follow up with David [indiscernible] (00:42:43) the balance sheet later because I do want to ask
this second question to John. I think – I guess what was surprising to me is that you had like a BNPL solar thing to
begin with, right? So, Regions has done a great job at not only convincing investors that it's completely changed
in terms of its underwriting and risk management but also that in the numbers. And I guess – this is a two-part
question. Number one, as you think about an uncertain [indiscernible] (00:43:22) ahead, do you feel like you've
sort of fully captured like things like that the BNL solar that you're now discontinuing that may not be something
that you would normally do under your risk management profile?
And maybe the follow-up question to that is, the 35, 45 basis points, I think a lot of investors are thinking about a
mild recession in 2024. Maybe it just feels like for bank investors versus other types of investors. But in that case,
where would Regions peak [indiscernible] (00:43:56) recession relative to that 35, 45 basis point range for next
year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
I think that the answer to your first question is yes, to – anything that we're – and we feel like we've been through
our portfolios, certainly been through the new businesses we've acquired and any products or programs that don't
meet our risk and return profiles, we've exited. And in the case of this particular program, as I mentioned, we
exited it in 2022 because of the structure of it. We've only begun to see some results.
And frankly, those results probably are consistent with our expectations when we shut the program down. So, we
are continuing to always evaluating the performance of our products, of our capabilities, our businesses, our
portfolios to ensure that we're getting an appropriate return on the business that we do. And so, I'm pretty
comfortable there.
With respect to our guidance of 35 to 45 basis points, in the period of 2014 to 2019, our average charge-offs were
38 basis points. And so, I think we still – and we have contemplated, we believe, what we consider to be the
probability of a soft landing versus a mild recession in our projections for charge-offs and, at this point, still feel
good about the 35 to 45 basis points in 2024.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
And I would add is, it's David, that if you think about our recessions, probably if it comes, it would be, we think,
fairly mild. As we look at consumers and we can look at them through the checking account and activity going in
there, we look at businesses, we talk to our business partners all the time. Businesses and consumers are in

pretty good shape. And in particular, for the consumer, if you look at housing prices, those continue to remain
strong, and a lot of our lending, if you will, in the consumer space is tied to the house, to the home. So, I think that
we have a bit of a buffer. And going back to the history that John just mentioned, the 38 basis points between
2014 and 2019 gives us confidence that even if we did that, we'd be in that range.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. You noted that higher rates are pushing up deposit betas
and also changing the mix in NIB and IB deposits. Some of your peers have been saying we're closer to the end
of this. Do you think that there's anything different that you're seeing versus peers, or is your deposit strategy
changing in any way given the increased likelihood of higher for longer rates?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner, Jr. A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
I don't think our deposit base, if anything, is a bit better than the peer group. We don't have anything unique to us
that would cause our beta to be higher than anybody else in this rising rate environment. As a matter of fact, we
did happen to grow more non-interest-bearing deposits during the pandemic than most of our peers, and that's
being put to work. So that element of it, maybe that piece of it is a bit different. And that's what we called for in the
guidance that we've given you that it would remix into interest-bearing accounts.
We still have a low loan-deposit ratio. We still have not wholesale funded. So, I don't think that whatever the beta
is in the industry, Regions is going to be better than that. We're already better than that right now with a beta of
34%, and the peers are at 49% on a peer median basis right now. So, I just don't think that if it's coming to the
end and then it'll come to the end for us, too.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, John. Hi, David. David, can we circle back to the Shared National Credit Exam? I'm curious. Obviously, it's
changed over the years. And if I recall it correctly, they examine those books both in the spring and the fall, which
you referenced, and we'll get the results early in February or sometime in February. But can you share with us
any color like what was the emphasis? Was it on leveraged loans? Was it on office, commercial, or real estate?
Was there greater stress in certain markets over others? Just any elaboration would be helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Gerard, this is John. We didn't notice anything specific about the most recent exam. It was broad-based
both with respect to product type and business and geography.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then, you guys touched a little bit about the economy in your markets. So, you gave us obviously
the forecast you use in building out CECL reserves. What are you guys seeing down there? There's so many
crosscurrents going on in the national numbers. Is it still – I'm assuming there's strength, there's employment
strength, there's business strength, any color there would be helpful as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Across the southeast, which is where 86% of our deposits are in seven southeastern states, if we add
Texas, it goes above 90%. We're still seeing a pretty strong economy. And in seven of the eight southeastern
states that we would point to, unemployment rates are at or near historical lows. Customers are still – consumers
are still in a very good position. There are plenty of work. There are routinely economic development projects.

New jobs being announced across markets: Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi. And, of course,
Texas is continuing to do really well. So, I'd say customer sentiment is still positive but cautious given all the
things that are going on both the national and international geopolitical level. But customers are – businesses are
just still doing pretty well, and the consumer definitely is.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Actually, John, just a follow-up quickly there. Putting the geopolitical international issues on the side for a
moment, do you have any sense what the customers are looking for to give them more confidence? Is it the Fed
finishing with interest rates, raising interest rates until we get to that terminal rate, or is it better – the better
budgeting out of Washington? What – because we hear this from your peers as well, so it's not uncommon. But
what I'm trying to figure out what the catalysts will be where businesses really get confident again.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
I think the biggest thing is the Federal Reserve, and the Fed making a declaration that inflation is now under
control, and that they're not going to continue to raise rates. They don't have to continue to raise rates. I think
they've been sitting in that message and creating a sense that the environment is more stable than others might –
business owners might feel today would be hugely helpful.
With respect to what's going on in the national level, politically, I don't know that I have an answer for you there,
and I don't expect that to change anytime in the near term.
