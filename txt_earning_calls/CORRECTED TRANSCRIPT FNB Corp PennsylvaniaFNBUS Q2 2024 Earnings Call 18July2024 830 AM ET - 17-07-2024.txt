......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr.
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Vince Calabrese, our Chief
Financial Officer, and Gary Guerrieri, our Chief Credit Officer. FNB reported solid second quarter results with net
income available to common shareholders of $123 million or $0.34 per diluted common share. Pre-provision net
revenue increased over 4% linked quarter, supported by our well-managed expenses and continued strong
noninterest income levels. Tangible book value per share grew 12% year-over-year to reach a record high at
$9.88. The second quarter's performance was driven by our long-term strategic goals to gain market share
through loan deposit growth, diversify revenue streams, and manage risk.
As we've previously mentioned, FNB is well positioned to steadily increase market share in this volatile
environment, given the strength of our capital and liquidity position and adherence to our consistently
conservative underwriting guidance. FNB reported linked quarter loan and deposit growth of 3.6% and 1%,
respectively, demonstrating our ability to execute on this strategy. Both of these results exceeded the published
H8 data this quarter for both large and small institutions. The loan and deposit growth benefited from our
investments in our digital eStore, with total interactions increasing 22% year-over-year. The increase in
commercial loans was driven by activity across the footprint, highlighted by double-digit year-over-year growth
across the Carolinas. Our Pittsburgh and Cleveland regions in commercial equipment finance business also
posted strong contributions. The increase in FNB's commercial real estate portfolio included fundings on
previously originated projects.
On a spot basis, consumer loans grew 5% linked quarter led by growth in residential mortgages. While growth in
this portfolio is seasonally higher in the second quarter, our results also reflect the continued successful execution
in key markets by our expanded mortgage banker team and longstanding strategy of serving the purchase

market. This activity ultimately leads to increased households and deposit share growth. Deposits benefited from
seasonal inflows as well as new production, which was generated through targeted deposit initiatives and
promotions. Noninterest-bearing deposits ended the quarter over $10 billion, an annualized increase of 3.2% from
the prior quarter. The mix of noninterest-bearing deposits to total deposits ended the quarter at 29%, a consistent
level since December of 2023. As we have frequently discussed, our strategy has been to price our deposits to
protect our peer-leading deposit beta while supporting our client base. Our loan-to-deposit ratio currently equals
96%. We are expecting lower loan originations and implementing a number of deposit initiatives in the second half
of the year that will bring our loan-to-deposit ratio back towards historical levels.
Another longer-term strategic focus has been diversifying our revenue streams. Achieving stable noninterest
income at near record levels, $88 million, in both the first and second quarters highlights the strength and range of
our business model and FNB's robust suite of products and services. For the first half of the year, noninterest
income totaled $176 million, a 10% increase over the same period in 2023. Fee income growth was led by our
mortgage banking operations growing over 50%, strong wealth management revenue, and Treasury Management
fee income growth.
Our success growing noninterest income is expected to continue as we enter the second half of the year. FNB's
balance sheet strategy is part of our proactive approach to risk management. As we draw closer to a reduction in
interest rates, we continue to move towards a neutral interest rate position to provide stability and potential
improvement in margin in a falling rate environment. Beyond interest rate risk, FNB's comprehensive approach to
credit risk management has led to strong and stable asset quality and consistent outperformance versus peers.
Our credit team proactively monitors each loan portfolio and overall concentrations at a granular level, which has
served us well through many economic cycles. I will now pass the call over to Gary to provide further detail on the
overall asset quality. Gary?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. We ended the quarter with our asset quality metrics remaining at
solid level. Total delinquency finished the quarter at 63 basis points, down 1 bp from the prior quarter. NPLs and
OREO remained unchanged, ending at 33 basis points, a multiyear low with net charge-offs at 9 basis points,
reflecting solid performance in the current economic environment. Total provision expense for the quarter stood at
$20.2 million, with $12.8 million utilized to support loan growth and the remainder providing for charge-offs. Our
ended funding reserve stands at $419 million, up $12.5 million in the quarter, ending at 1.24%. When including
acquired unamortized loan discounts, our reserve stands at 1.35% and our NPL coverage position remains strong
at 421% inclusive of the discounts.
We continue to successfully execute on our strategy to monitor the non-owner CRE portfolio. Monthly, we analyze
and segment upcoming and previously resolved maturities, largest exposures, and market conditions for the
various property types across our footprint. At quarter-end, delinquency and NPLs for the non-owner occupied
CRE portfolio improved slightly and continue to remain very low at 16 and 12 basis points, respectively. Net
charge-offs reflected solid performance for the quarter at 4 basis points, again confirming our consistent
underwriting and strong sponsorship. The non-owner occupied office portfolio delinquency totaled 4 basis points
with no NPLs, largely in line with the prior quarter.
We maintained the strong focus on credit risk management, and our portfolio continues to perform well throughout
numerous economic cycles. Quarterly, we performed specific in-depth reviews of our portfolios along with a full
portfolio stress test. Our stress testing results for this quarter have again shown lower net charge-offs and stable
provision compared to the prior quarter's results with our current ACL covering approximately 90% of our

projected charge-offs in a severe economic downturn, again confirming that our well-balanced loan portfolio
enables us to withstand various stressed economic scenarios.
In closing, our asset quality metrics ended the quarter at good levels, and our loan portfolio continues to remain
stable. Our continuous investments in credit risk management systems and corresponding staff complements our
consistent underwriting and core credit philosophy. Our experienced banking teams and tenured leadership have
positioned the company well to continue to achieve prudent loan growth while proactively managing credit risk
through many economic cycles.
I'll now turn the call over to Vince Calabrese, our Chief Financial Officer, for his remarks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr.
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thanks, Gary, and good morning. Today, I will focus on the second quarter's financial results and walk through
our third quarter and full year guidance. As Vince mentioned, total loans and leases ended the quarter at $33.8
billion, a linked quarter increase of $1.2 billion or 3.6%. This growth included $633 million in consumer loans
driven by the seasonal peak for residential mortgage originations and $540 million in commercial loans and
leases, reflecting healthy activity in C&I and equipment finance as well as additional growth from fundings on
previously committed commercial real estate projects.
Total deposits ended the quarter at $35 billion, an increase of $259 million linked quarter, including growth in
certificates of deposits of $202 million and noninterest-bearing deposits of $80 million as the seasonal build in
public funds deposits has begun. The loan-to-deposit ratio increased to 96% at June 30 compared to 94% at
March 31. We expect this ratio to decline in the medium term both organically and with several initiatives our team
has implemented.
Starting on the loan side of the equation, the second quarter's robust loan growth was higher than forecasted due
to seasonality of our mortgage business and stronger commercial client acquisition across the footprint. We
expect loan growth to return to historical levels for the remainder of the year as pipelines have declined somewhat
given a strong production in the quarter and a typical pause in client activity leading up to the presidential election.
Looking at deposits, we currently have several deposit-gathering initiatives targeting both commercial and
consumer balances, including a strong Treasury Management pipeline and a new five-month CD in consumer
money market promotion. Given the short duration of these promotions, we should be able to quickly reprice them
lower when rates fall. Over the past year, our deposit growth and mix outperformed the industry, and we believe
that will continue.
This past quarter, we largely utilized short-term borrowings to fund the robust loan growth with total borrowings
increasing $1.4 billion. When rates start to decrease, the cost of these borrowings will move down quickly. As
Vince mentioned, over the last several quarters, we have been strategically positioning our balance sheet to be
more neutral benefit from lower interest rates. We have $4.5 billion of short-term or floating rate borrowings,
around $4 billion of non-maturity deposits that are currently priced at or above 4.75%, a $6.9 billion CD portfolio
with a nine-month duration, and, lastly, as I mentioned on last quarter's earnings call, we have around $1 billion of
swaps that mature beginning in 2025 with rates between 75 and 100 basis points.
Additionally, the investment portfolio has an annual cash flow of $850 million at a current roll-off yield of 2.50%.
And we have approximately $2.6 billion of fixed rate loan repayments with an average rate of 4.5% in the next 12
months. In total, we have over $16 billion of liabilities and swaps and nearly $3.5 billion of securities, cash flows,

and fixed rate loan repayments that should provide significant benefit and protection in a falling rate environment
compared to the $16 billion of loans that reprice within three months.
The second quarter's net interest margin was 3.09%, 9 basis point decrease largely due to the increased short-
term borrowings, driving a 13 basis point increase in the total cost of funds to 2.46%. This was partially offset by a
3 basis point increase in the total yield on earning assets to 5.43%. Our spot deposit cost ended the quarter at
2.13%, leading to a total cumulative spot deposit beta of 38% since the current interest rate increases began in
March 2022, positioning us well against our competitors.
Net interest income totaled $315.9 million, $3.1 million decrease from the prior quarter as the higher cost of funds
was partially offset by higher loan balances, with new origination yields for the quarter around 7%, consistent level
since the third quarter of 2023. We expect the second quarter's net interest income to be the trough for the year
and should see modest sequential improvement in the third and fourth quarter.
Turning to noninterest income and expense. Noninterest income totaled $87.9 million, consistent with the prior
quarter's strong result. The largest quarterly increase was $2.8 million in service charges driven by Treasury
Management revenues continuing to gain momentum and seasonally higher consumer transaction levels.
Offsetting this growth were declines in capital markets, given lower commercial customer transaction activity and
lower mortgage banking operations income, driven by a slight decline in sold loan volume and net fair value
adjustments from pipeline hedging activity.
Operating noninterest expenses were well-managed and totaled $225.8 million, an $8.3 million decrease from the
prior quarter after adjusting for $0.8 million of significant items in the current quarter and $3 million last quarter.
The largest driver for the decline was salaries and employee benefits, which decreased $8.2 million, primarily due
to normal seasonal long-term compensation expense of $6.9 million and seasonally higher employer-paid payroll
taxes in the prior quarter. The efficiency ratio remained at a peer-leading level, coming in at 54.4% second
quarter.
FNB's capital position remained strong, and we were able to support robust loan growth and maintain the tangible
common equity ratio near 8% and CET1 ratio at 10.2%, both of which remain above our stated operating levels.
Tangible book value per common share was $9.88 at June 30, an increase of $1.09 or 12.4% compared to June
30 of 2023. AOCI reduced tangible book value per common share by $0.67 as of quarter-end compared to $0.99
at the end of the second quarter of last year.
Let's now look at guidance for the third quarter and full year of 2024. We are maintaining our full year balance
sheet guidance. Loans are expected to grow mid-single digits on a full year basis. Total deposits are expected to
grow low single digits on a year-over-year basis. Our mix of noninterest-bearing deposits to total deposits is
anticipated to remain superior to peers. Our projected full year net interest income expectation is revised to be
between $1.27 billion and $1.29 billion, assuming 125 basis point rate cut in September. This revision reflects our
interest-bearing liability mix as we enter the second half of the year. Net interest income for the third quarter is
expected to be between $315 million and $325 million.
Given the strength of our noninterest income generation in the first half of the year, we have increased our full
year guide to be between $350 million and $355 million. Third quarter noninterest income is expected to be
between $85 million and $90 million. We now anticipate the full year guidance for noninterest expense to be
between $900 million and $915 million due to production-related compensation given the strong fee income
results. Third quarter noninterest expense is expected to be between $220 million and $230 million. The full year

provision guidance range is lowered to $75 million to $95 million and remains dependent on net loan growth and
charge-off activity in the second half of the year.
Lastly, the full year effective tax rate should be between 21% and 22%, which does not assume any investment
tax credit activity that may occur.
With that, I will turn the call back to Vince.

Thank you, Vince. This year celebrates our 160th anniversary as a nationally chartered bank, obtained through
the National Banking Act in 1864. Through the execution of our growth strategy, FNB has continued to prosper
and develop into a diversified $48 billion regional financial institution. This quarter's results continue to reflect
those efforts with a resilient balance sheet, strong capital generation, ample liquidity, and linked quarter growth in
pre-provision net revenue. We consistently receive national recognition that affirms our competitive advantage
with prominent publications such as Forbes ranking FNB one of America's best banks and naming us to its global
2,000 listed companies based on sales, profit, assets, and market value.
Our strategic emphasis on innovation is integral to our success, and we continue to earn national attention for
digital engagement and leadership. Most recently, FNB's eStore won best digital initiative at the 2024 Banking
Tech Awards USA. These awards highlight outstanding achievements and success in the US banking and fintech
industry. In addition to winning best digital initiative, FNB was honored among the nation's top five largest financial
institution as a finalist for Best Use of Technology in Consumer Banking, Best User or Customer Experience
Initiative, and Top Innovation. We also continue to earn awards for our commitment to our employees who enable
our success. During the second quarter, we extended the long list of top workplace honors we received nationally
in the financial services industry and throughout our footprint, with specific awards for culture, excellence, and
leadership.
As we reflect on a solid quarter, I want to thank our team for their many contributions. We appreciate your
dedication. By maintaining our focus on our shared principles and goals, we are poised to navigate the ever-
changing macroeconomic landscape and deliver for our customers, communities, and shareholders.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes
from Daniel Tamayo with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe starting on the balance sheet side, you talked
about a slowing of loan growth in the back half of the year relative to what's been a – or what was a pretty strong
quarter in the second quarter. Obviously, you had a lot of residential mortgage growth. You had some commercial
real estate growth and some commercial growth as well. Maybe you can talk about just the mix that you're
expecting in the back half, if you expect that slowing to come from the residential side. Obviously, some
seasonality in the second quarter here. But if that's part of it, if you're also seeing – expecting a slowing on the
commercial real estate side with construction fundings slowing. Just curious on the mix you expect.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
[indiscernible] (00:22:55) Vince Delie. I was going to turn it over to Vince Calabrese [indiscernible] (00:23:00).
Hey, I think a couple of things. First of all, the mortgage growth is seasonal. So, we've already started to see, as
we move into the third quarter, we started to see a lower loss in our pipeline. So, we expect that to come down
fairly substantially. So, less being put on the balance sheet as we move forward there through the second half of
the year.
The construction fundings were on committed – primarily committed obligations. We do quite a bit where we do
the construction financing, and it's taken out by some form down the road. So, those fund ups occur as natural
funding as we moved through the construction period. So that presented growth this quarter. And then, we had
some pretty robust growth in equipment finance. We've been doing pretty well there with leases pretty much
across the footprint. And there were some renewable energy deals that closed, I think, in the last quarter of last
year. And the balances there – I think, we've exceeded $1 billion in balances in that book of business. So, it's
grown nicely over time and continues to grow.
C&I has contributed. There was some significant growth in the Carolinas. Pittsburgh, Cleveland contributed. So,
it's – it was really coming from a bunch of areas, really robust. In certain areas, it appears we've been taking
share from others. So, I think the disruption that occurred really kind of mixed it up with the customer base and
gave us an opportunity to get out and fetch new transactions, which I think is very positive. The growth was higher
than I expected. But I think it's okay because it positions us well moving into 2025, given our shifting to a more
liability-sensitive balance sheet, and putting those assets on really sets us up for 2025 from an earnings
perspective that we can continue to generate deposits.
So, I think that on the loan side, that's what we're guiding. Our guidance hasn't changed. We're expecting to
produce the same level that we forecasted at the end of the year, but it's a little lumpy. And I'll tell you pipelines
are down. We booked quite a bit this quarter. So, we're moving into the next quarter, down about 10% in
commercial pipelines. And it's still a little sluggish on the consumer side. So, we haven't seen as much. While
we've seen more mortgage, first mortgage volume, there was much less home equity [indiscernible] (00:25:53)
volume. So, they kind of offset each other. And we're not expecting that to come back this year. So, that's how the

book just performs. The only other category, I think, I didn't speak about was indirect auto. I don't know, Gary,
what your thoughts are there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. But we had a solid growth quarter in Q2, which is, again, seasonals, very similar to the mortgage. We're
getting really high-quality paper there with focus on profitability. So, improving margins and playing at the high
end of the FICO band is really working well for us. But, again, that's seasonal. We're going to pick our spots and
manage that through those seasonal periods. So, we expect that to come down as we move toward the latter half
of the year as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And then, from a funding perspective, if we're able to execute our plan, we have seen growth in our Treasury
Management pipeline. So, we're seeing some very large good opportunities where we're principal bank. That
should bring in demand deposits as we move forward. I think the bright spot here, while we had to fund that
growth with borrowings temporarily, the upside for us in the long run is to replace that with lower-cost funding.
And I think we've proven that we can do that. So, the upside into 2025 is us replacing those borrowings with
deposits.
And if you look at the demand deposit base, it's been stable. We've been at 29% for several quarters. We had
growth in demand deposits, which you're not seeing across [audio gap] (00:27:41) some pretty decent growth in
certain categories where we priced up to bring deposits on. We have not been as aggressive as others
throughout the cycle. And we're starting to look at pockets for us to price up to bring in deposits, which also leads
low-cost deposits in the quarter. So, our strategy is [indiscernible] (00:28:02) attracting those demand deposits as
well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Our beta performance grows to that point, too. Right? It's up very gradually from last quarter 36.5% to 38%. So,
that again is us protecting the overall profitability.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. As you can imagine, it's a challenging time to navigate. We don't want to pull back. I think a lot of
competitors have shrunk their balance sheet or pulled back. I think this is an opportunity for us to go after some
share, bring in households, and do what we do well, which is convert them to primary clients. So, I hope that
helps.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Yeah. No, that's terrific. I really appreciate all that color. Maybe a quick follow-up. Just – you touched on it at the
end there on the funding side. But you also mentioned in the prepared comments about deposit initiatives in the
back half of the year to kind of rightsize the loan-to-deposit ratio. Just curious if you could go into a little more
detail about what you were thinking and how that could impact kind of funding costs and then...

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2024
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, we – sure. We've modified the incentive plans for the consumer bank. We have kind of a kicker for deposit
growth. So shifting the loan growth is pretty minuscule in that segment. So, we thought, hey, we'll incent them to
go after deposits. We have a number of calling initiatives across the company on larger Treasury Management
opportunities. We won a bunch of transactions that haven't funded yet which are fairly sizable. It seems like
clients are willing to talk to us given our performance over this past cycle. So we've kind of proven that we're
capable of handling those relationships throughout cycle and without any issues.
I think that the people are very focused on it. Our teams are focused on it. And as long as we manage them in
that direction and focus mainly on funding, that's – it's going to pay off. And the other thing is the eStore, the
investment in digital and the digital technology, the interactions are up 22%. We're starting to get some traction
there on the consumer side. And then I don't want to get into excruciating detail, but there's – there are things that
we do from an incentive compensation perspective kind of across the board to incent deposit growth.
And then we've done some things on the mortgage side where we've used data analytics to cross-sell customers
that we bring in, particularly in the physician's book and the jumbo mortgage segment. And we're partnering with
wealth to do some things. And brokerage, brokerage, we're working on a money market product that will work
hand-in-hand with our brokerage sales, which should help.
So, there's a bunch of things going on. And I think that it's going to take a little bit of time to get some lift out of it.
But, certainly, as we move into the second half of this year and into 2025, you should see the benefits of
everything we're doing from a funding perspective.

fee businesses in particular that you want to ramp up or you need to ramp up to get there?

We targeted 30% of total revenue. We almost got there. But then the world changed in terms of net interest
income, so it diluted that effort. But I think that's really the long-term target. We want to continue to build out those
fee-based businesses and make sure that it starts to consume more of the total revenue. That 30% target is kind
of our target. It's not something we're going to get to immediately, but we strive to get there. I think we've had
great success in capital markets. We've done well building out our derivatives platform, our syndications platform.
We have debt capital markets group that we [indiscernible] (00:33:03) the debt offerings.
I think there's opportunity for us to do things from an advisory perspective. I think there's opportunity for us to
continue to focus on building out public finance. There are things that, I think, in the future businesses that are
bolt-on businesses that will contribute and help continue to diversify that fee income base. Given our size and our
– the span of the company, the markets that we compete in, I think we have a terrific opportunity to capitalize on
those segments. And I think once we move into our building, I – we build a trading floor so that we could bring all
those capital markets groups together. It's fairly impressive. I think bringing clients in and showing them that we
have these capabilities will lead to additional opportunities for us.
And then, on the wealth side, we have opportunities there. I think we've only scratched the surface in terms of
building out our teams in the markets that we moved into, and they were contributing nicely. I mean, wealth is
growing 10% annually. Every year, I think there's – for now there's upside. We've had records year after year. So,
building out the wealth platform continues and building out those capabilities continues. TM, there's tremendous
upside in Treasury Management fee income, again, given the growth of the company – and we bought banks in
the southeast that really didn't have robust Treasury Management offerings. So, as we build out that client base
on the commercial side, we will see opportunities to grow TM.
And then, the other units, mortgage is going to be cyclical and seasonal. And then, you have – but I still expect
mortgage to grow gradually over time as we continue to increase market share. Our team, they've done a terrific
job. Joe Cartellone has done a phenomenal job building out the teams and growing share. And if you look at the
amount of production that we've had even in this off-cycle, we've outperformed others in the markets that we
compete in. So, we've gained market share. I would expect us to continue to do that.
And then, the last piece is insurance. We have a decent insurance offering, and we have good leadership there.
And we started to focus on integ rating that even further into our product offering with our commercial bankers.
That seems to be going pretty well. So, I think there's upside there. It's been a little stagnant, but I think the
insurance market is firming and premiums are increasing. And we're starting to pick up larger and larger clients.
So, in that space, there's upside. So, we're pretty optimistic about those fee income categories. And I think it
shows in the performance. We've consistently kind of touted the capability and discussed what we were building
out. And I think performance over the last five or six years really illustrates the success we've had.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I would just comment that the percent of revenue is a function of the interest rate environment. So, growing that
absolute level, given all the initiatives Vince talked about, has been the key focus, and it just keeps building.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2024
Got it. Okay. All right. I appreciate. And then just maybe as a quick follow-up, just with some slower loan growth,
relatively speaking, to the second quarter, some slow growth in the back half of the year, and with you guys
already above your target capital levels, just wondering – and I know you bought back a little bit in the second
quarter. But would you expect buyback activity to maybe ramp up here or are you more price sensitive?
Obviously, we've seen a recent rally in bank stocks. So, just wondering how we should think about buyback
activity maybe as you see it today.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. No, I would say the level of activity we had in the second quarter was really just to kind of buy back some of
the incentive shares that were issued earlier in the year, so 250,000 that we bought. As we sit here today, the
focus on capital kind of building from here, at this point, we don't have any plans to repurchase shares looking at
the second half of the year. I mean, that can change if the environment changes, but right now, using the capital
to support the loan growth. I think the fact that we were able to support the robust loan growth that we had this
quarter had capital ratios CET1 hold at 10.2% and TCE ratio in that 0.1%. So, holding those levels of capital and
supporting the loan growth, I think, is kind of the best use of the capital at this point. And the buybacks will be part
of our operation every year as we go forward. But as we sit here today, I think that the best use is still letting that
gradually build a little bit [ph] as we go through the year (00:38:07).

Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Couple of follow-up questions on the funding strategy. So, just
wondering, what does the guide assume in terms of the borrowings? I'm assuming that stays there. Or is there an
opportunity with these deposit initiatives to pay some of that down?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I would say that the guide basically has the interest liability position that we're entering the third quarter, it's
what's baked into that. So, the better we do on the initiatives that Vince has described, there's obviously
opportunity to fund additional loan growth as well as replace some of the short-term borrowings.
As you commented, too, the short-term borrowings are that, short term. So, when the Fed does cut, the rate on
those, it's going to come down in tandem with the rate coming down. So, we made a decision during the quarter,
given the loan growth, to kind of forego a little bit of earnings in the short run in the second quarter, but position us
so that we can benefit from the down rates as we go forward.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2024
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
No, understood. Okay. And it sounds like these deposit initiatives are – it doesn't sound like they're CDs. So, just
wondering to the extent that they're successful, what is the new money rate on these deposits that you hope to
bring in versus the 5% borrowing yield?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I mean, it'll be a mix, Casey. I mean we still have some level of CDs coming in. I mean, it's definitely
slowed. So the kind of remixing of what it was last year, if you look at the second quarter, literally, we increased
CDs $36 million on average a month so – where we had a high of $164 million last July. So, the shifting there has
definitely slowed, but there still – customers are still grabbing those rates, right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. Our people aren't incented to originate CDs.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Right. That's [indiscernible] (00:40:13). So, I think that the operating account initiatives that Vince talked about
calling on companies, new customers to come in, bringing in their operating accounts, noninterest-bearing, is
obviously a key focus. So it's hard to predict with any certainty the mix, but it'll be a little bit of both. And the CD,
that's there if customers want to grab it before rates start to come down. So, we have some attractive offerings
there. I think that the important, as we move forward, is just growing the total deposits.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. For sure.
[indiscernible] (00:40:45)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And then, just last one for me, the slide 16, the balance sheet repricing. Thanks for sharing that. So, the
new money bond yield on the roll-off rate of 2.50%, just curious what yield you're getting on reinvestment. And
then, that swap with an 87 bp average received rate, is – that $1 billion, does that mature – is that ratable
throughout 2025? Just looking for the maturity date on that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. A couple of comments on that. I think we added this content just to give everybody a little more
understanding of kind of what's underneath. So, if you kind of roll through the pieces, the cash flow – $850 million
annual cash flow coming off at 2.50%, I mean, today we're investing 4.5% to 4.75%. During the second quarter,
our guys did a great job opportunistically investing earlier in the quarter, kind of south – I mean, north of 5%.

Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
We're speaking to page 16 of the deck just so everybody knows. I'm sorry.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
No, no. It's a good point because I do want to talk through that. And then these other pieces here would give us
some flexibility as we move forward. I mean, $6.9 billion of time deposits, we have the maturity of nine months.
And the CD promotions we've had over the last year, 7 months, 13 months. Today, our best rate is on a five
months. So, the idea is that when the Fed does start to move, we have the ability [ph] of withdrawing (00:42:13)
and we can kind of reprice those. So, that's an important point.
We have another $4 billion in nonmaturity deposits [ph] the break is above (00:42:19) 4.75%. Those are very
repriceable. Again, once the Fed moves and even if the Fed is expected to continue to move after that first move,
so that gives us some flexibility. The $4.5 billion of short-term or floating rate borrowings, again, those will just
reprice down. So, that's another lever for us.
And then, the $1 billion of swaps at the bottom there, Casey, is really – they're going to mature at 2.50% a quarter
next year. 87 basis points is what we're giving today. I mean, that's a negative carry today of $10 million to $11
million a quarter, and that's going to start to go away in January.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2024
Good morning, Russell.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Maybe just following up on the discussion we were just having, given your move toward neutral and some of the
balance sheet repricing we just discussed, is an initial Fed cut still a negative to the NIM as deposit cost lag or
can some of that fixed repricing dynamic overcome a headwind from an initial step down?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christine E. Tvaroch A
Chief Audit Executive, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Hey, Russell. It's Chris. Yeah, I think it depends on kind of what the expectation is for cuts kind of after that first
cut as Vince kind of talked about. If that move – down rates are expected to continue, that gives us a lot more
cover to being aggressive on the deposit pricing side. I'd say if it's one and done like we kind of have in our
guidance, there probably is some short-term timing issues where it probably is a near-term negative, and then,
there are some timing constraints with how fast we can reprice deposits. But if there is several more cuts baked
into the curve and that's kind of expected on the client side, that gives us a lot more cover to act more
aggressively. And hopefully, we can capture some of that downside data a little bit quicker than we think here.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Got it. Thanks, Chris. And then, just could you guys talk about deposit pricing competition in your markets
just broadly? Getting some, I don't know, mixed messages early in earnings season, particularly out of the
southeast where some peers are talking about accelerated competition, others talking about successfully locking
down promo rates. Just your overall thought would be helpful in terms of where you think deposit costs are
headed over the next couple quarters.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I think that many of our competitors have kind of shifted. Once they panicked and priced up deposits to, basically,
through liquidity, they have backed off. So, I think a lot of the larger competitors have backed off a little bit. So, if
you'll look at their promotional pricing that's out there, you're going to see 25 to 50 basis point reduction versus
what was running in the heat, the – I call it, the micro liquidity crisis.
But I think – that's why you're getting mixed signals. I think it's different for each institution. And then, all of a
sudden, you'll see somebody emerge and they'll have a really aggressive rate. So, I think they've moved – people
have generally moved – companies have generally moved in to a strategy that we had where they were
selectively pricing the products and maybe doing a more quiet promotional pricing versus what's on their website.
So, you're going to hear a mixed bag. I mean, it's going to be all over the [ph] book (00:45:49).
So, I would say it's less competitive than it was. But in spots, there's still some irrational pricing out there. So,
depending on who's calling on your client, you need to react to that, right? So, that's where I think we are. But I do
– just in the surveys that we do, we do a lot of work on monitoring who's pricing what. We've seen a pullback in
the stated pricing, the promotional pricing that's out there that we can see from many of our competitors. So, it's
come down. But then, like I said, every once in a while somebody [ph] merges with the only aggressive brand
(00:46:30).

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2024
The term is coming. A lot of the competitors are doing what we're doing, shortening the duration of the time
deposit portfolio by putting out a more aggressive CD that's priced shorter, five months, three months, six months.
[indiscernible] (00:46:51) the pricings moved in. Anyway, that's what we're seeing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I would just add there, too. It depends on if the bank is growing loans or not, right? So, depending on who
you're talking to...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yes, that's true.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
...the banks that aren't growing loans at all, they're just managing the rates down more because they're not trying
to generate deposits. With our growth and bringing in all those new customers, it's a different environment that
you want the deposit, you want to bring them in. So, it really depends on the market and the bank.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
As I read through the earnings releases, I can see that. I can see our margin contracted because we were
lending. Others have improved their margin, right? I mean, they've seen inflows of deposits, and the pricing is all
over the board. So, it's choppy. It's still competitive. And I think people are just retrenching to deal with the
situation on an individual basis.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I would just add, too, the margin compression, as Vince said, it was down 9 basis points for the quarter. But
if you look at the dollars in net interest income, right, which is the most critical from a bottom-line profitability
standpoint, I mean, we were down $3.1 million this quarter, $5 million decline last quarter, [indiscernible]
(00:48:06) the quarter before, but kind of in line with that. And then the go-forward, as I mentioned earlier, more
success we have with the deposit initiatives, and then rates come down, we can reprice all these items on slide
16 that I talked about. It gives you that kind of positive momentum as you go forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Well, guys, I appreciate both your thoughts on the question. I guess, the last one for me and understanding
it sounds like we are poised to be flat to up on NII going forward. But a little incremental pressure overall to the
guide. Would you guys consider another securities portfolio repositioning or how does that currently sit in your
opportunity set?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I would just say the net interest income, I mean, we expect the second quarter to be the trough in net
interest income dollars. So, we do expect it to move up the next couple of quarters just given all the things that

we've described. And then we evaluate the whole balance sheet on a regular basis. So as we said with what we
did in the fourth quarter, we're very thoughtful about the size of that, the nature of the overall optimization strategy
we've deployed. So, we look at everything. So, everything's kind of on the table from an investment standpoint.
But I think we're focused primarily on the organic growth in the loans and then all the deposit initiatives to really
fund the loan growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. It really helps us to bring those households on – I mean, that helps us – in the future helps us generate
additional business. I think we've done a pretty good job of cross-selling to that customer base.

Manuel Navas Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Hey. Good morning. If the Fed points to kind of a continued down rate cycle, could you have upside to the high
end of your NII range or would it actually maybe exceed it? Just kind of some thoughts on that kind of variability
that you kind of touched on briefly before.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christine E. Tvaroch A
Chief Audit Executive, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. Manuel, I think like I said, our guide has one cut in it right now and that's it for the year. If there were more
kind of cuts baked into the curve, I think the upside really would show up in 2025. I think that sets us up really well
for what 2025 could look like, especially if the curve uninverts after, I don't know how long, about two years now of
inversion. So, I think that would be more of a 2025 impact. I'm not sure it would be helpful, but like I said, there's
some mechanics on the timing of when CDs mature. Some of that's locked in. So, with five months CDs that are
coming on now, a lot of the repricing happens at the end of the year. I think that really sets us up better for 2025.

Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A

Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I was just going to say, yeah, the normal seasonal surge that we see in deposits, particularly on our municipal
side, happens kind of now through October-November timeframe. And that could be $600 million to $800 million
kind of peak to trough and usually they bottom in the first quarter. So, that's the seasonality we expect, and that
would be supplemented by the initiatives Vince talked about earlier as far as the commercial and consumer
deposits.

Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I think you've touched on it a bit, but, clearly, loan growth was incredibly strong, and it's a great opportunity to win
new households and clients to the firm. Just wondering where you're seeing the greatest opportunity to take
share, whether it's a certain region or segment of the business. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. We've seen some pretty decent growth coming out of the Carolinas. And I think that continues to be an
area with upside for us. I think that we've only started to scratch the surface in terms of our calling activity there.
So there's quite a bit on the table. And as we moved into South Carolina, we've built out – building out Greenville
and South Charleston. There's a lot of opportunity there for us, both from wealth – wealth, private banking, and
commercial banking.
So we continue to see good growth in those areas in Charlotte. We've had some good success. We've had
success in the – from a deposit perspective, we've had great success in Wilmington, in Greensboro. So we're
pretty optimistic about the Southeast. And then, Pittsburgh and – Pittsburgh continues to perform very well. We
have a lot of upside there. We have significant share here in the Pittsburgh market.
So, I think in certain business lines, we're undersized. Like mortgage, I don't think we're sized appropriately given
the deposit share that we have here. So, there is some opportunity there for us to continue to grow in the
Pittsburgh market from a consumer lending perspective and, basically, from a C&I perspective. We're not
penetrating in this market. So, there's quite a bit to do. Cleveland had – was sluggish over the last few years. But I
think there's upside in the Cleveland market for us in C&I.
And then, I mentioned equipment finance. I think equipment finance has done very well and should continue to do
well as we move through this period, get through the election, because there's been kind of a hold-up on some
small-ticket capital spending from the C&I base. We'll see that release as we move past November when there's
more clarity on what's going to happen. I think those are the areas that I think have the most upside for us. And
then, on the flip side of that, there's less activity going on in CRE, obviously, right, [ph] given these happenings
(00:55:21).

Got it. That's super helpful. And then, understanding these things take time, just wondering if we could get your
updated thoughts on M&A. Clearly valuations across the board have improved and especially in light of a
potentially more accommodating regulatory environment potentially on the horizon. Just wondering updated
thoughts, any thoughts on potentially where you would be looking to add density or fill in? Thank you.

Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I think it's going to be the same answer we've given the last few quarters. We're going to be opportunistic.
We are focused internally. We have a number of major initiatives going on right now and building out heightened

standards, capabilities. We're focusing on building out the digital platform. You remember when you came and
met with us, we had quite a bit that we were tackling. That doesn't mean M&A is off the table. It's just that we've
been focused internally to strengthen the platform, right, so that we can grow and expand and benefit from the
scale that we put on.
So, I would say it's the same. We'll be opportunistic and look for opportunities in market. We've been building out
Virginia on a de novo basis. So, we've seen a lot of branch announcements in Northern Virginia [indiscernible]
(00:56:57) coming online in the near term. And then, Richmond, we've been focusing on. And so that's kind of
happening organically. And then, in the Carolinas, we're building out the Charlotte market, the Inner City Charlotte
market. Yadkin is largely outside of the city of Charlotte. So, yeah, we're looking at opportunities to go in there.
So, you'll see some de novo expansion in those markets, which I think Charlotte in particular should bring us
some good opportunities from a consumer and small business perspective when we build out that channel.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Understood. You guys certainly have plenty of green shoots internally. Maybe last question for me, just a model
refresher here. On the expense side, you have about a $7 million double-carry from the excess lease expense
while you're still leasing. Can you remind us, does that – that doesn't carry through to 2025, is that correct? Or is
there any kind of change in plans or timing with the move to the new building?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James L. Dutey A
Chief Accounting Officer, SVP & Controller, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, Kelly, it's Jim Dutey. That's exactly right. Yeah. Once we move in fourth quarter, is our planned move-in
date at 2024, that double carry on the current leases that we have [ph] will fall in (00:58:30). So, it's not a
carryforward into 2025.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 18-Jul-2024
Hey. Good morning, guys.

Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A

Good morning, Brian.

Good morning.

Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
That expense reduction, can you remind us what that is on the building, on the property?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
It's basically the timing of our move. We leased a number of locations here because we got a lot of people spread
across five locations here on the North Shore. So, it was the timing. It's the rent expense that started on the
building, right, that we're paying rent on all these other locations, and so, we can ship into the building, which
we're scheduled to do in November, early December this year. So, the question was, what happens with that
additional rent expense. It goes away. So, we're double – right now, we have double expenses, right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And Brian, there's a footnote on slide 20, the guidance slide that just – we put $7 million of rent expense.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And we're not actually paying [indiscernible] (00:59:45) double.

Brian Martin Q

Yeah, yeah. I got it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
We got free rent for the move, but from a GAAP accounting [indiscernible] (00:59:52).

[indiscernible] (00:59:55)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah. Okay. And then, just on the funding cost, can you talk about – I mean, can you give any sense on – I know
you talked about the margin inflecting. As far as the cost of deposits, kind of do those begin to plateau here? I
guess they've been – the rate of increase have obviously been narrowing. But just, I guess, when do you expect
the deposit cost to kind of plateau?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I mean, it's hard to say. I mean, it's still moving up a little bit. I mentioned the CD mix shift, it definitely slowed
quite a bit. So, if you looked at total deposit costs [indiscernible] (01:00:30) on a spot basis, [indiscernible]
(01:00:32) in the first quarter. If you went back, it's definitely – the increase has slowed. I guess it becomes a
function of – what Chris was talking about earlier is if Fed does cut and there was an expectation, they're going to
keep cutting. Obviously, that gives you more ability to [indiscernible] (01:00:49) that down. And all the pieces on
slide 16 that I went through, there's a lot of levers there and flexibility that, again, if the expectation is that the Fed
is going to continue to cut after hopefully cutting in September, then all those pieces are in play and have ability
to...
[indiscernible] (01:01:05)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
But I would say if you look at the makeup of the deposit base, it's not going to be – I don't see pricing increasing
to draw in deposits. Like I said, we've seen a number of competitors reduce their promotional [indiscernible]
(01:01:18). So, I think it's more a function of shift. So, are we able to hold the demand deposits and be able to
hold the low-cost interest checking? Are we able to hold that, right, without migration? I think the outflows have
slowed dramatically, so we should be seeing, right...
[indiscernible] (01:01:38)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And the new initiatives that bring in, right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
New initiatives are focused more on lower cost deposit categories. So, I think it should help us, but it's all a
function of mix at this point.

Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
But from a beta standpoint, I guess our beta has been very strong, the 38% versus the peers. We've been a good
bit better than the peers, and we would expect that just to gradually go up a little bit more from here, probably
similar to what it did kind of first and second quarter. So, just as another indicator.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah. Okay. That's helpful. And then, maybe just one for Gary. On the credit side, the stress testing, Gary, I
mean, anything you're seeing as a sign of weakness or potential concerns given that things sound very good and
just a granularity and all the credit performance? But as you kind of do the stress test every quarter, is anything
coming up that's got you maybe more alerted to it or just paying closer attention to it?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Brian, I think over the last three quarters now – and we stress test, as you know, every quarter. Over the last
three quarters, we've seen improvements from a potential charge-off and loss perspective. So, those updates and
those reviews around a severe economy continue to show improvement. We're very, very aggressive in managing
the book as you all know. And that test that our team goes through each and every quarter is really showing
positive results for us as we continue to migrate through the current economy.

Brian Martin Q

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Sorry. Okay. I think that's really it for me. I guess, maybe one last just modeling question. I think, did you guys
mention that there were some impairment on the mortgage this quarter or was that – did I not hear that right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
No, just normal fair value marks on the overall portfolio, Brian. That's all. I mean, that swings, I mean, quarter to
quarter anywhere from $1 million or $2 million one way to $1 million or $2 million the other way. So, it was just
kind of hedging the pipeline.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah. Okay. That's it guys, just want to make sure of that. Okay. Thank you, guys, for taking the questions.
Everything else was answered.

Gary L. Guerrieri A

Thank you. Thank you, everybody. I appreciate your interest and great questions. I hope we've answered
everybody's questions. We're very optimistic as we move forward, I think we got a great opportunity. As we said in
the previous call, we're going to go after market share because we were in a position to do that. I think we have a
great opportunity to create some pretty positive financial outcomes as we move forward and execute our plan to
drive deposit growth in the second half of the year. So, really appreciate it, and appreciate your interest and thank
you again. And thank you to all of our employees for their hard work. I know a lot of you are listening. I know. We
