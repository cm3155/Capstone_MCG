Q3 2020 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 28-Oct-2020
With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. On today's call, I will cover a number of topics: First, I'll briefly
discuss our year-to-date 2020 operating results. Second, I will cover recent balance sheet trends. Third, I'll review
our issuance program. And finally, I'll discuss our continued strong liquidity and capital position.
Slide 3 summarizes our results from the third quarter and year-to-date 2020. Year-to-date, we reported net
income of just over $7 billion which included a $10.8 billion increase in credit reserves under the CECL
framework.
On slide 4, we show average balance sheet trends over the past five quarters in constant dollars. On this basis,
we have grown our balance sheet by approximately 13% over the last year as we continue to support our
Consumer and Institutional clients as they managed through the COVID-19 health crisis while also maintaining a
strong balance sheet.
We continue to see strong growth in deposits across both GCB and ICG. Loans declined, primarily driven by a
modest decline in GCB as a result of lower consumer spending. Trading-related assets and liabilities grew,
reflecting the continuation of heightened client activity relative to the prior year, and long-term debt increased as
we built liquidity to support our clients and maintained the firm's robust liquidity profile.
Slide 5 presents trends in our loan portfolio on an average basis in constant dollars. Total Citigroup loans
decreased 1% year-over-year. In our Consumer franchise, average loans declined 4% year-over-year, reflecting
the impact of lower consumer spending in our Cards business, higher payments by customers given fiscal
stimulus and a continuation of the pause in proactive marketing.
In our Institutional franchise, average loans grew 2% year-over-year. Average loans in Corporate Lending grew
4% year-over-year but were down 14% sequentially, reflecting significant repayments as we assisted our clients
in accessing the capital markets.
Private Bank loans increased 6%, largely driven by residential real estate lending to our high-net worth clients.
TTS loans decreased 7%, reflecting softness in underlying trade flows and the continued low level of spend in
Commercial Cards. And loans included in Corp/Other continued to decline, driven by the wind-down of legacy
assets.
On slide 6, we show credit quality trends in our GCB and ICG loan portfolios. In ICG, credit quality remained
broadly stable. In the third quarter, non-accrual loans declined by roughly $400 million sequentially to $3.6 billion
or 93 basis points of total loans, reflecting write-offs and repayments across the portfolio.
In GCB, credit trends remained broadly stable to improving this quarter, given high levels of liquidity in the U.S.,
lower spending and the benefits of relief programs. However, we do expect losses to begin to rise next year as
government stimulus and other programs roll off and unemployment remains elevated.
At an aggregate level, we are likely to see losses peak towards the end of 2021, with losses in Asia and Mexico
peaking a little earlier than the U.S. That said, we believe we are well-prepared for expected credit losses across
both our Consumer and Institutional portfolios. As of the third quarter, we held credit reserves of $28.9 billion. Of

this amount, $3.1 billion represents our management adjustment for economic uncertainty which factors in a
downside scenario that is more adverse than our base case.
As we noted on our earnings call earlier this month, given the lifetime nature of the CECL methodology and the
conservative nature of our management adjustment, it is now more likely than not that we'll see reserve releases
and our ACL come down in 2021 to offset future losses and as we continue to progress through the crisis,
assuming our base case holds.
Turning to slide 7, we show trends in average deposits over the past five quarters in constant dollars. Total
average deposits increased 19% from the prior-year period, reflecting continued client engagement as well as the
elevated level of liquidity in the system.
Now, let me cover our current benchmark debt issuance program on slide 8. So far this year, we have issued
approximately $20 billion of current level benchmark debt across a variety of tenors, including the inaugural $2.5
billion affordable housing bond we priced last week. Going forward, we'll continue to maintain the flexibility to
issue a mix of tenors, currencies and structures as we prudently manage the liquidity profile of the firm and
support our clients.
On slide 9, let me cover our issuance maturity and redemption expectations. As I just mentioned, we have issued
approximately $20 billion year-to-date and we expect our total issuance to be around this level; however, we will
remain opportunistic given the uncertain environment and we will continue to be flexible around optimizing our
funding through opportunistic redemptions.
On slide 10, we show the composition of our long-term debt outstanding. During the third quarter, our total long-
term debt declined by approximately $7 billion to $273 billion as we allowed our bank debt to mature given strong
deposit growth.
On slide 11, we provide an update of our LCR metrics and drivers. Our average LCR increased modestly to 118%
this year.
Turning to slide 12 let me summarize our key regulatory capital metrics. Our CET1 capital ratio increased to
11.8%, primarily driven by net income. And our SLRs were 6.8% and 6.6% for Citigroup and Citibank respectively.
Moving to our last slide let me summarize several key points: Year-to-date, we have performed well and
demonstrated the significant earnings power of the franchise. We earned roughly $7 billion of net income year-to-
date despite a $10.8 billion increase in credit reserves. We maintain a strong capital position with a CET1 capital
ratio of 11.8%, close to 200 basis points above our regulatory minimum requirement, an SLR of 6.8% and a
surplus above our TLAC requirement. And we also maintain a strong liquidity position with an average LCR of
118%, over $950 billion of available liquidity resources and we expect to be in compliance with the NSFR when
the rule is effective. Our capital and liquidity profile remains strong and well-positioned to withstand potential
pressure if economic conditions deteriorate. And we continue to have the flexibility to deploy these resources in
ways that deepen and expand our client relationships and support the broader recovery.
Before we move onto Q&A, let me touch briefly on LIBOR. We are continuing to prepare for the transition away
from LIBOR by the end of 2021 by working with our regulators and various industry-working groups as well as
through the work streams we've established within Citi.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 28-Oct-2020
Since the second quarter, we have transitioned the discounting of centrally cleared euro and US dollar interest
rate derivatives to the euro short-term rate and the secured overnight financing rate respectively, announced the
adoption of newly published ISDA protocol for existing IBOR derivatives, transactions and increased our virtual
client communication efforts, including outreach regarding these new industry-led protocols and solutions.
With regard to the subset of our preferreds, which we have mentioned on previous calls, while we are continuing
to evaluate alternatives, we don't have any further updates at this time.
And with that, Mark and I will be happy to answer your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION

Scott Cavanagh Q
Analyst, APG Asset Management US, Inc.
Yeah. I can hear.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
There we go. Okay. That's better.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Cavanagh Q
Analyst, APG Asset Management US, Inc.
So when we talked about the last topic you brought up, the LIBOR transition, could you talk about your efforts to
do – to transition both on the asset and liability perspective? And then when you think about the outreach to your
holders, whether it's the preferreds or unsecureds, how are you thinking about that addressing potential
language? Whether it's consent, fees, exchanges, how are you thinking about addressing that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
So, Scott, it's Mike. A couple of thoughts on the preferreds. So as we've talked about in the past there's a number
of things that we're evaluating. We talked about a couple of options, including an amendment or even an
exchange but at the same time we're working with the industry on broad-based solutions.
So we think it's important to have that evaluation being done in parallel. So for the benefit of everyone, not
jumping ahead with some transaction or some amendment makes sense to us given the broader industry efforts.
We're well-aware of the transition timeline and our view on these securities are unchanged, that we have a desire
to address them.
More broadly, in the transition where we look at the assets and liabilities, obviously there's a number of work
streams and efforts underway. That includes looking at derivatives. We've talked about the ISDA protocols, so
that is a significant effort and something that is an important step forward in dealing with the transition in the
derivatives book.
And then of course when we look at the broader portfolios, we're thinking about that transition away from LIBOR.
We've talked a lot about the replacement rate of SOFR and how that operates as more of a risk-free rate. And so
we're having to be thoughtful about the pricing of those loans, both internally and how we think about that for our
clients.
So a lot of the work is around, again that client outreach, things around the operational capabilities, things around
the pricing of that activity. So a lot of that work continues around those efforts; broad-based transition planning.
But again there will be some important steps along the way that we're taking with those industry-wide efforts.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Cavanagh Q
Analyst, APG Asset Management US, Inc.
Okay. And then a follow-up question, talking about regulation. As we had the final rule for the TLAC holdings, how
should we be thinking about this as far as how meaningful it is for not only a Tier 2 deduction but rather from
when you think about your trading desk and the risk allocation and the disincentive to hold G-SIBs bonds and the
potential for more volatility of these bonds because of this rule, could you kind of give us a scope of what is
historical levels in regards to this new minimums and is this something that will be meaningful?

Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure. So generally speaking, as we look at this final rule, it's substantially consistent with the proposal and we
believe the rule does allow for sufficient flexibility and market-making activities. And that's both in BAU and even
during heightened stress periods where you may be carrying a higher level of inventory.
So if you look at the past year, that exception for market-making activities was still sufficient. So when we look at
our Tier 2, obviously we're carrying substantially above where our target is. We've talked about a target of roughly
200 basis points, and at this point our Tier 2 is closer to 240 basis points.
In terms of the monitoring, of course we're always going be closely evaluating the balance sheet, the use of
resources of the balance sheet in the different businesses and the different activities. And really this would be no
different. Of course, we're going have a lens on this activity and understanding the use of resources. So our read
is that we think that exception for market-making is actually quite sufficient.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Brian Monteleone with Barclays.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Monteleone Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Monteleone Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Regarding the Consent Order, can you talk a little more granularly about the gap analysis, the kind of scope of
activities that are being analyzed? What areas do you think are most pressing and can you give some color on I
guess how you think this is going to make Citi a safer bank?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure. So I mentioned a couple things. So one, we obviously got three Consent Orders. So one was the civil
money penalty, the $400 million, and the other two were largely aligned and focused on our risk infrastructure and
controls, and there were a number of areas that were highlighted in both. One was enterprise risk, data, controls,
compliance, et cetera. And as you pointed out, the Consent Order referenced the need to develop end-state
plans, identify where we are today and close the gap – identify the gap and close the gap.
We've been clear that on a couple of things: One that we've got a sense of urgency to get after this. Two, I think
I've been clear that I consider this an investment – an investment in risk, infrastructure and controls. And three, as
an investment, I would expect improvement in our processes, enhanced technology and digital capabilities,
automated controls, straight-through processing, et cetera, and as a result greater efficiency in the way we do
business and in our ability to leverage our data and deliver products and services that are more innovative and in
a faster way to our clients.

And so I highlight that to say this is an investment that we are making in our platforms and in our operations. To
be a little bit more specific, there are operations that we still have today that have manual processes and steps
that are part of them; whether it be loan origination and processing where we have people who are responsible for
checks and balances and controls throughout that process as we're trying to move towards more updated and
more automated platforms.
As we make these investments in things like those loan operations, we will be able to reduce and eliminate
manual steps and replace that with an improved technology and process and/or improved data coming into our
systems so that you need fewer people to actually reconcile and provide the checks and balances along the way.
That's going make the process more efficient. That's going to ensure that we have more accurate information
without having those manual steps to get there. And that's going to allow for us to get a better product faster on
the other side of this.
And so investment is required, obviously. We have a sense of urgency to get after those investments, not only
because of the Consent Order but because of what they mean and our ability to do business and serve our clients
and win.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Q
Monteleone
Analyst, Barclays Capital,
Inc.
Thanks for that, Mark. Then maybe a follow-up question for Mike. On slide 21, you have the surplus TLAC and
long-term debt, which I believe is including the temporary benefit around the leverage exposure. Do you have
what that surplus would be without that temporary benefit? And as you think about managing your outstanding
TLAC over the next six months, are you managing it to this buffer as reported and assuming that the temporary
release gets extended or are you managing it more towards an ex-release basis? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure. Certainly, managing the funding profile and the TLAC assuming that that exception goes away at some
point, and it is set to expire at the end of the first quarter. So, yes, as you look at our TLAC and the long-term debt
as a percentage of leverage, that gives us a $34 billion TLAC cushion today. If you take out or as you let that
exception expire, it basically takes away roughly $18 billion. So it brings down your TLAC to, call it, $16 billion, all
else equal, at that time.
In the past, we've talked about a targeted range of $7 billion to $8 billion. So at $16 billion, it's still double the
targeted range that we're comfortable running at. And that actually doesn't include the issuance that we had just
done last week. So – but we are definitely managing the profile with the long-term view as if that expires.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 28-Oct-2020
Good morning.

Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure. Good morning, Robert.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Smalley Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
A couple of questions. First one on Commercial Real Estate, could you talk about your exposures there as we see
concerns about the impact of the pandemic on the sector with respect to construction mortgages and debt? And
also, any other kind of secondary exposure you might have to businesses or families who derive most of their
income from real estate? That's my first one.
Second one, just a data point could you give us your VaR number for the quarter? It's usually a Q number but I
didn't – I haven't seen it reported yet.
And then third, on preferreds, I think you left a preferred outstanding to float, the 6.125s? It's got LIBOR + 4.47%
reset. Could you talk about why you elected to do that? We're seeing some other of your peers issue fixed-for-life
securities and the $25 market at [ph] 4.375%. Is 400 something that you're okay with paying? What's the kind of
Mendoza line there on the back end?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Great. Well, there's a lot there. Why don't I take the first two and then Mike I'll let you chime in on the third one.
So first, look, let me start by just kind of reiterating something that I've stated before which is remember our
strategy is to focus on large, multi-national clients. They tend to be high-investment grade in terms of that focus.
We've been very disciplined about that. We've got a disciplined risk framework and we manage very tightly to our
risk appetite.
With that said, we've got a long history in many of these sectors. Many of the sectors that we talk about is high-
risk industries today. We have a long history in them. We have a long history with the clients that we serve in
those specific areas. Now, with Commercial Real Estate specifically, as of the end of the quarter, our total credit
exposure – corporate credit exposure to CRE was about $58 billion. About $42 billion of that was funded, and that
would represent about 6% of our outstanding loans. We also – additionally, we had approximately 80% of that
exposure as of the quarter-end was to borrowers in the US and 73% of that was investment grade.
When we looked deeper into the CRE portfolio, about 57% of the exposure relates to exposures that are secured
by mortgages or underlying properties, or in well-rated securitization exposures. And a little bit more than half of
that is in Community Reinvestment Act-related lending. About 25% relates to unsecured loans to large REITs and
about 80% of the exposure there is rated investment grade. And a little less than 20% relates to our CRE
exposure in the Private Bank, getting to part of your question of which 100% of that is secured by mortgages or
underlying properties. And about 78% of that was rated investment grade again at the end of this quarter.
Final point I guess I'd make is that as you know and as we've mentioned before, we feel as though we are well
reserved as a firm. And as I look at the allowance for credit losses for the CRE portfolio, they're about 2% of
funded loans and about 4% on the funded non-investment grade loans. So again, if you think about our total ICG

business, it has a funded-to-loan ratio of 1.82%. You see that in our presentation, a higher percentage tied to this
CRE portfolio.
On your question related to VaR, our average VaR decreased in the quarter by about $48 million and it's down to
about $100 million, $104 million or so at the end of the quarter, and that decrease is largely due to the market
volatility coming down as well as the normalization of credit spreads.
Mike, do you want to take the last question there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure. So in terms of the preferreds, as we've talked about before, as these securities become callable, we'll
evaluate, one, the need for that capital to remain outstanding. And then the second, how do we think about the
economics if we do need that capital of calling that structure and reissuing versus leaving it outstanding. And so –
and keep in mind these structures, this one in particular, is callable quarterly, so we will continue to evaluate this
structure and all the structures that are callable around whether it makes sense to leave outstanding or call and
reissue. And I think that series that you picked out in particular is pretty close for consideration but we'll continue
to evaluate all the structures as we normally do.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Smalley Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Are there any considerations that from the outside we may not be seeing that go into your calculation as to calling
or not calling or anything that you're weighting more that we may not be considering?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
No, I don't think so. I mean of course, when we do these, we'll look at the price. We'll include fees in our thinking
and other factors. We've talked about the transition away from LIBOR and the language. So that's another factor
we think about but I don't think you're all missing anything.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 28-Oct-2020
Arnold Shoichi Kakuda Q
Analyst, Bloomberg Intelligence
So – good morning. You and your peers largely kept the allowance for loan losses flat in 3Q after a big [ph] $0.5
billion (00:29:13) increase and I hear you on the – if the base case holds the 2021 reserves might go down. But
over the past few weeks, we've seen US COVID cases rise. And so my question is it might be too early to talk
about a change in your potential economic assumptions versus September 30, but are the future reserves, builds
or releases, are they more dependent on the outlook for – the longer-term outlook or maybe even 2021, 2022
than kind of the near-term?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. Look, the – again, we've got about $28.9 billion in reserves. And if you look through what we did in the third
quarter, we had a slight build. But the significant portion of that was tied to our downside scenario. And so when
we looked at kind of the base scenario given the volumes we saw in our Consumer business, we actually saw
some improvement in the reserve levels. And it was in fact the assumptions that we made around our downside
scenario that drove an increase, the $800 million increase, in our management adjustment which went up to
about $3.1 billion.
I highlight that to say as we look at the variables that go into our models, it was in fact our estimates for a
downside, worse unemployment, slower recovery in the way of GDP; a situation where there was no vaccine in
2021, the developed market equities declined meaningfully so a pretty significant downside scenario. We
probability weight that and that was the more meaningful driver in the reserve, the slight reserve build and the
increase in the management adjustment.
I'd say to the other part of your question, there's still a fair amount of uncertainty that remains just kind of given
the rise in cases that we're seeing, given the election that's out there, given Brexit, given the lack of clarity around
stimulus. But that said, we feel good about the reserve levels we have. We feel good about the downside scenario
that's been factored in and the probability associated with that. And we'll just have to see how things kind of play
out. It's too soon to suggest otherwise.

Okay. Got it. Thank you. And then switching gears, Citigroup – you performed – your June stress test results were
better than peers, your CET1 declined less than peers, right, and I think that's a great achievement. It's really a
testament to all the hard work that you had put in to the transformation of Citigroup since the financial crisis.
However, since then you've announced a CEO change and then followed by the Consent Orders. So how should
we think about the upcoming stress test results kind of in light of some of the recent changes that we've seen at
Citigroup?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Well, yeah, I think I would separate the two. And so you're right. We have had, I think, very strong performance
coming straight through 2019 and we have continued to perform well through this crisis, an unprecedented crisis,
and continued to maintain capital strength and liquidity and serve our clients.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 28-Oct-2020
We are having a transition of our CEO. After a long tenure here, Mike has announced his retirement and Jane will
take over in February. And I think that will create an opportunity for us to continue I think a path of continued
strong performance under Jane's leadership. And we're very much looking forward to that with Mike having
brought us to a very, very good point, I would say, in the way of our strategy and our financial performance.
We're in a crisis and so the regulators have decided to request a resubmission from the industry. And we, like
others, have spent the past almost 45 days working on that resubmission, crafting our own scenario of what this
stress could look like and comparing that to the three scenarios provided by the Fed. And we'll make that
submission in, I think, in December. They've talked about perhaps sharing the output from that but they haven't
spoken to how they would intend to use that.
And so we don't have any additional clarity as to how the results of that would be used. But the final point I'd
make is that we've built a resubmission that reflects the environment that we're in and our best sense for what we
would need to continue to invest in our franchise to ensure strong performance going forward. And we go into this
next submission with an SCB from the last one that was 2.5% and that was floored. So our underlying SCB was
something closer to 1.9% including the dividend. So I think we go into it from a position of relative strength given
the environment.

Hima B. Inguva Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Thanks for doing the call. And I'm sorry I had an issue with the line so – and Scott asked my question on TLAC
holdings, so that's great. I'm going to switch up a bit and – if you don't mind. I'm going ask you about the election
that we have coming up and market seems to be thinking a Biden presidency with a Democratic Senate. I'm not
asking you to opine on the outcome of the election. I'm more interested in knowing your thoughts around the
implications of one way or the other, if you think we could have a more stricter regulatory regime going forward if it
were to be a Biden presidency or if it is status quo, do you expect anything I guess to move forward in the
Senate?
And then to that if you see a split Congress or if – any other color that you can provide in terms of the detail of
how the Senate may shape up? Again, not the outcome. How regulation may shape up depending on how the
turnout maybe, I would really appreciate it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. Hima, as you can imagine, I mean I'm not going to comment kind of on the politics and the potential
outcomes of an administration change. I think that would be difficult to do at this stage and there's so many
factors involved in that. I think there are a couple of things that remain true, almost regardless of how it plays out.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 28-Oct-2020
And one is, it's an obvious one I think but we need a resolution to this health crisis that we're managing through.
And we need a vaccine that's put in place, one that works and one that can be broadly distributed. We need a
stimulus program to help bridge consumers through this and in order to kind of starve off some of the
unemployment – increased unemployment that we're seeing and slower growth of GDP.
We certainly – we potentially could see tax implications from it but that is an uncertainty. And if that plays out with
the Biden administration, I talked on the earnings call as to what the implications of that would be. I think we, like
many other corporations, will have to kind of take a look at what this crisis means for our going forward, right? So
we are working with clients on a regular basis as they think about their supply chains and things of that sort, as
they think about their real estate footprint and things of that sort, and we too will think about things like our real
estate footprint or the future of work, for example.
And so there's a fair amount of uncertainty that's out there. I can't speak specifically to the implications of the
political outcome. What I can say is that our focus on many of the things you've heard us talk to before; whether
it's investing in this franchise or execution against our strategy or improving profits or improving our return on and
return of capital will still be there and we'll still have a sense of urgency for continuing down that path.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hima B. Inguva Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Okay. Great. Thank you. And if I could – if I may ask a follow-up on that, on the real estate footprint or maybe
more importantly about future of workplace, do you envision a scenario where you see your employees primarily
working remotely or maybe doing a hybrid work setup? Can you share any thinking around that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. Look, I'm of the belief that there's always going to be – it's important to have some population kind of in the
office, if for no other reason, training and that's how a lot of knowledge gets transferred through and to our
employees. And so I don't – I certainly don't envision a world where everyone is working remote at our firm.
I do think that we are still learning from this remote working pilot, if you will. It's a pretty extensive pilot but we're
still learning from that. And I do think it will inform different parts of the organization and different parts of the
operations as to what will work in the office and what can work remotely. But it's still soon to tell.
At this point, we're still at a little bit north of 60% of our population globally working remotely. And so, it's still – and
by the way, it's working, right? We're still doing business. We still had I think a very good quarter in the third
quarter despite a significant part of our population having to work remotely and we're still covering our clients
effectively. And so there's still learning there, Hima. I don't have an end strategy to point to yet, but it is something
that we continue to analyze and assess.

Q
Hey. Good morning and thanks for doing the call, as always. I'll take another stab at the LIBOR transition and
preferreds, and I appreciate your prior comments on this subject. Just thinking about the transition away and
preferreds with LIBOR back ends, when you say the consent or exchange of whatever shape or form that move
away from LIBOR, [ph] takes to the (00:41:04) preferred, are you contemplating a possible move to a CMT plus

[ph] HECM (00:41:08) back end in that consent or exchange, or is it only going to be into a SOFR plus credit
spread plus the back end kind of a structure?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure. Thanks for the question. And as we look at these structures, we're of course going to take the feedback of
our investors and where there's demand. And, yes, we've seen back end SOFR. We've used that. Part of that is
certainly supporting the transition away from LIBOR and into SOFR.
That being said, we know there's been structures out there using CMT and that demand has been good for CMT.
And so as we look at needs in the future, that will certainly be a consideration.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
And for the outstanding ones, which [indiscernible] (00:42:00) back in the day which have LIBOR back ends, I'm
just curious about as you think about this consent or exchange you plan to do to correct the LIBOR language, can
you think about moving those bonds to – exchanging them to a CMT structure versus SOFR as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. So, again, anything that we would come to market with, we would consider what are our options for doing a
new transaction. I think with the exchange, we would have to – if that was a scenario that we wanted to go ahead
with, we would have to think about what qualifies as an exchange of a like security.
So – but I think as we do new issues, or call bonds, and come to the market, CMT is something we would
certainly consider given the interest in that structure. And I think in exchange, we would just have to evaluate
whether that would be an appropriately like exchange.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Understood. Appreciate that. And a second one on the business side. On the Cards side and we've seen a couple
of pure-play card names, one came out and guided to much higher number of delinquencies from people coming
of forbearance and we had other name, which kind of did not see that. So just curious to see what you're seeing
in the two parts of your Card (sic) [Cards] (00:43:28) businesses as people come off forbearance? How many are
kind of rolling into that delinquent bucket and between delinquent buckets, and has anything really changed in the
last month or so since the stimulus seems to be on a back burner here? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark A. L. Mason A
Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. Sure. Look, it's interesting. We have continued to see good performance from our Consumer card
customers and we've seen that both in payment rates. We've seen that we've started to see purchase sales
improvement, just in terms of they're still down year-over-year for certain, but not down as much as they had been
in the prior two quarters. And as you've heard us say before, a lot of this is a by-product of the stimulus but also
the discipline of the consumer in deciding to channel that liquidity towards continuing to pay their cards or card
balances.

In the US, to answer your question more specifically, we've seen about 80% of those that were on a forbearance
program roll-off program. And of those, about 80% continue to make payments in our US Card (sic) [Cards]
(00:44:48) business.
In our Mexico business, when we look at customers there, we see probably 91% have rolled off by the end of the
third quarter. So – and about 84% of the Cards customers have remained current after rolling off and about 95%
of the PIL, personal loan customers and payroll customers have remained current after they've rolled off and so
we've seen continued resiliency. When you look at the delinquency rates that we show, they're relatively stable.
And as we mentioned, we would expect, we're now kind of expecting losses to peak really closer towards the end
of 2021 given the way the delinquency buckets have been trending.

Hi. Thanks. Thanks for taking the call and answering all these questions.

Chief Financial Officer, Citigroup, Inc.
Sure. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary David Kessler Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (Private Banking)
Good morning. One more on LIBOR, particularly some – we're starting to see some issuers address, whether it's
in Europe or Federal Farm Credit Bank here with some exchanges. And when you think about the regulatory
piece or the legislative piece, and there's been items written on things being held up in Albany and you've got
Delaware involved here with preferreds, I mean what is sort of like the optimal scenario? Is it – you guys have
been more upfront than most on at least willingness to discuss it, so how should we think about what the optimal
scenario is for the pursuit of the updated fallback language?
And we're drawing towards the end of the year. We're going to be in crunch time as we cross into January, so I
think we're all looking for clarification because this is obviously a big issue. And as a money center bank, member
of our committee, we'd love to get more clarity from all of you, but you guys have more of a willingness to speak,
so we're sort of looking for you guys to be the market leader here. So – I mean what can you tell us maybe a little
bit more extensively on that front?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Look, and as I've been talking about, the securities that we've been talking about addressing, we've been looking
at a parallel process, meaning that working with the industry on broad-based solutions but also looking at what we
could potentially do on our own.
I do think the more consistent that the industry tackles some of these items and think about prefs broadly, I think
the better off we are because you create that consistency. And I think you – as you've seen with ARRC making
suggestions, I think the reason why they've been effective is because you are bringing together the broad
industry, you're coming up with proposed solutions and you're rolling that out in a largely consistent fashion.

I do think the industry is best served with that consistent approach. And I think, again, it's a complex transition
away from LIBOR given the scope of it, given the amount of products it impacts. Obviously, when you think about
derivatives, there's protocol focus therefore that is meant to create some consistency. Of course, on the loan side,
there's repapering efforts and so where you can get consistency there with fallback language. So my view is that
creating consistency, bringing the industry together to help try to recommend and solve some of these topics is
how the industry is best served.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary David Kessler Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (Private Banking)
Just from a timing perspective, I mean it's obviously very complicated, so when is it too late? I mean when, as
investors, do we need to start worrying that we're not getting there fast enough and what can we do to be partners
in this?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Yeah. It's a good question. Of course, the focus that we've had, that the industry has had is preparing to transition
away from LIBOR by the end of 2021. So I think that's a good way to think about it. So I would say that's where
our focus has been. More broadly, as you think about this transition away, there's market liquidity that has to
develop and this again is away from prefs but market liquidity developing, with the recent move away from LIBOR
to SOFR discounting as an example, hopefully brings more liquidity into the system, more participation in those
rates.
And of course the transition is a function of the bank's capabilities but also the investors and the clients we serve.
So it's very broad-based. It really needs that broad sponsorship to transition away successfully as an industry. So
there's a lot here. And I think just everybody doing their part and working towards that transition will serve
everyone best.

Jesse Rosenthal Q
Analyst, CreditSights, Inc.
A quick follow-up question on the topic du jour, LIBOR and the preferreds, I'm kind of getting at the question a
different way. As mentioned that you do have this proposed legislation at the New York State level, I think it's also
circulating at the federal level. So just wanted to kind of get your view on the possibility or the feasibility even, of a
legislative fix here and then if there's anything that we should be monitoring on that legislative outcome?

Q3 2020 Earnings Call - Fixed Income 28-Oct-2020
Look, I realize there's a lot of appropriate questions around this and it's hard to put a probability on whether that
happens at New York or some other level. I am encouraged by the dialogue occurring and looking at that broad-
based solution. I do think it's sensible to look at this holistically but it's very hard to put a probability on how that
gets solved and whether the legislative solution will go through and at what level that gets done. So, sorry; I wish
there was more that we can say with degree of certainty. But again, as I said before, broad-based solutions is the
best and it's good to see this dialogue occurring.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jesse Rosenthal Q
Analyst, CreditSights, Inc.
Fair enough. And then just a quick follow-up on just if you were to pursue an exchange or just, in general, if any
issuer pursues an exchange, are there any potential regulatory issues or concerns with losing capital treatment
there if you're specifically exchanging a preferred that has less than five years to the first call?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Verdeschi A
Treasurer, Citigroup, Inc.
Look, I think those are – there's a variety of topics that we've had to cover; tax, regulatory. We don't believe that
would present a problem for us. So we've done a lot of work in this space. There's more work to be done. But
given the nature of why we're doing such workaround this in terms of a consideration, we don't believe that would
be problematic.
