Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning and welcome to Synovus Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. All participants will be in a
listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.
And I will now turn the call over to Jennifer Demba, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba
Director-Investor Relations, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you and good morning. During today's call, we will reference the slides and press release that are available
within the Investor Relations section of our website, synovus.com. Chairman, CEO and President, Kevin Blair, will

your questions at the end of the call.
Our comments include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and
the actual results could vary materially. We list these factors that might cause results to differ materially in our
press release and in our SEC filings, which are available on our website. We do not assume any obligation to
update any forward-looking statements because of new information, early developments or otherwise, except as
may be required by law. During the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures related to the company's
performance. You may see the reconciliation of these measures in the appendix to our presentation.
And now, Kevin Blair will provide an overview of the quarter.

Kevin S. Blair
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2023 earnings
call. Over the past three months, Synovus has taken several actions to better position the bank for a more
challenging, higher for longer interest rate environment, while continuing to build and expand our diversified
business model in order to deliver long-term sustainable growth.
As previously announced, we completed two loan sale transactions during the third quarter, which strengthened
the balance sheet and freed up capital for the bank to make more profitable relationship-oriented loans. The
proceeds from the third party indirect auto and medical office building loan sales allowed us to reduce our level of
wholesale funding, while accelerating the path to our greater than 10% CET1 target.
Also, on September 30, we further simplified our business mix by selling our asset management firm, GLOBALT,
to its management team. The divestiture will be immaterial to earnings and allow the bank to reallocate capital to
higher-returning fee income lines of business, while continuing to meet our wealth clients' needs. We believe
GLOBALT has a bright future as an independent investment advisor, enabled to explore a wide range of
additional partners and potential client relationships.
To that end, we are in discussions to continue and expand our long-standing held for sale partnership with
GreenSky. Given our ongoing discussions, any potential revenue benefits are not currently included in our 2023
guidance. There will be more details forthcoming over the next two to three months. We are navigating the short-
term headwinds presented by the higher interest rates by making the tough decisions around the business mix,

balance sheet optimization and operating expenses, all of which will generate better financial performance in the
quarters and years to come.
Now, let's move to slide 3 for the quarterly financial highlights. Synovus reported third quarter diluted EPS of
$0.60 and an adjusted EPS of $0.84. There were year-over-year and linked quarter revenue and PPNR
headwinds as a result of the continued higher deposit costs, leading to further, but more moderate net interest
margin contraction. As expected, loan growth outside the medical office building sale was less than 1% in the
third quarter. This core loan growth was primarily attributable to multi-family construction draws, while the middle
market commercial, Corporate and Investment Banking and specialty lines activity contributed to C&I loan growth.
There continues to be an increased emphasis on stronger returns and more deposit relationship-based lending,
which has translated into higher yields on new production.
Core deposits increased 1% or $432 million from the second quarter. Importantly, the shift from consumer money
market accounts to higher rate time deposits slowed during the third quarter. Non-interest bearing deposits
declined less than in the first and second quarter, but clients continued to use their excess operating and personal
funds. Net interest margin contraction was not as significant as expected due to modestly better asset yields and
funding costs. Also, our deposit generation strategies are demonstrating continued success as production
remained strong with third quarter levels approximately 70% higher compared to the same period in 2022.
Given the pressures on the margin, our operating expense discipline was quite evident as adjusted non-interest
expense increased 2% from the second quarter and rose just 4% from the prior year. Cost containment remains a
very high priority. In fact, we expect adjusted non-interest expense should be relatively flat year-over-year in
2024, as we implement more cost reduction initiatives in a variety of areas.
As expected, credit cost increased as we continue to move off historically low levels. However, excluding the third
quarter loan sales, net charge-offs remained manageable at 40 basis points, which includes a 21 basis point
impact from a commercial, industrial credit discussed in our recent 8-K filing. Along with other banks in the
syndicate, we are in the process of evaluating and assessing all avenues of recovery to include legal recourse
related to that specific transaction.
Finally, we continue to focus on maintaining a strong capital position as we navigate through a more volatile
economic environment. And with our CET1 position ending the quarter at 10.13%, we are now slightly above our
targeted capital levels. Over the near-term, we expect to continue to preserve capital in excess of our target levels
given the continued amount of economic uncertainty.
Now I'll turn it over to Jamie to cover the third quarter results in greater detail. Jamie?

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kevin. As you can see on slide 4, total loan balances ended the third quarter at $44 billion, reflecting a
sequential decline of $674 million or 2%. This includes the impact of the sale of the $1.2 billion medical office loan
portfolio. Similar to recent quarters, CRE growth was a function of draws related to existing multi-family
commitments and low levels of payoffs. On the C&I side, middle market commercial lending and corporate
investment banking contributed to growth. Our new loan fundings remain focused on customers with more broad-
based deposit and fee income relationships.
At the same time, we are rationalizing growth in credit only lending areas that have a lower return profile or don't
meet our strategic relationship objectives. Our balance sheet optimization efforts should continue over the near-

term and loan and core deposit growth should be relatively balanced. No further meaningful loan portfolio sales
are being contemplated over the foreseeable future.
Turning to slide 5, core deposit balances grew $432 million or 1% sequentially during the third quarter, driven by a
23% increase in time deposits, which was partially offset by a 4% decline in non-interest bearing deposits.
Importantly, we leveraged our improved liquidity position to reduce wholesale funding by $1.6 billion, which
improved our wholesale funding ratio by 240 basis points, while public funds declined $146 million, or 2%.
The non-interest bearing deposit decline is a byproduct of deployment of excess funds and continued pressures
from the higher rate environment. This is a slower decline than we experienced during the first quarter and
second quarter. There was also a moderation in the decline in money market accounts during the quarter as the
shift from money market accounts to CDs slowed. We expect to experience some core deposit growth during the
remainder of the year. Supporting this growth are the seasonal tailwinds, along with our targeted deposit
gathering efforts.
As we look to deposit rates, our average cost of deposits increased 36 basis points in the third quarter to 2.31%,
which was a slower rate of increase than in the second quarter and equates to a cycle to date total deposit beta of
42% through the third quarter. From the month of June to the month of September, total deposit costs were up 29
basis points. Our deposit costs and betas were impacted by the pricing lags on core interest bearing deposits, as
well as the decline in the non-interest bearing deposits. Our expectations for the through the cycle total deposit
betas are now slightly reduced to 46% to 47% at year end.
Now, moving to slides 6 and 7, net interest income was $443 million in the third quarter, down 7% versus a year
ago, and a decline of 3% from the second quarter, which is slightly better than our previously disclosed
expectations. NIM compression moderated during the third quarter, down 9 basis points from the prior quarter
versus 23 basis point sequential decline in the second quarter. The asset side of our balance sheet continued to
benefit from higher rates, though higher deposit pricing and further remixing within our NIB deposit portfolio offset
those gains.
As we look forward, we expect the fourth quarter NIM to decline in a similar amount as the third quarter, followed
by a relatively stable margin in the first quarter. That is expected to be followed by expansion as fixed rate asset
repricing is more than enough to overcome the gradually reducing headwinds of deposit repricing and negative
deposit mix shift. The graph on slide 7 outlines the estimated marginal benefit to our NIM relative to our 3.11%
NIM in the third quarter of 2023, attributable to fixed rate repricing for the asset and liability categories listed there.
This assumes rates remain constant with the September 30 levels at a 5.5% Fed funds and around 4.5% on the
10-year.
Slide 8 shows total reported non-interest revenue of $107 million. Adjusted non-interest revenue was $106 million,
down $4 million from the previous quarter and up $1 million year-over-year. The variance in quarter-on-quarter
fee income was due to a combination of factors. There was a change to the NSF/OD program in July, which
impacted non-interest income by approximately $1.5 million and is now almost fully reflected in fee income as of
quarter end. Core fee income has also been impacted by a soft mortgage lending market and more muted capital
markets activity.
However, the relative stability of fee income over time highlights the diversity of our revenue streams, many of
which are insulated from the impacts of the volatile rate environment. We continue to invest in core non-interest
revenue streams that deepen client relationships such as treasury and payment solutions, capital markets and
wealth management, which have demonstrated healthy growth over the past few years. We also continue to

simplify and optimize our business mix during the third quarter. The sale of asset management firm GLOBALT, to
its management team on September 30, led to a $1.9 million non-recurring gain during the third quarter and
should result in approximately $10 million per year reduction in the fee income and $8 million reduction in the non-
interest expense.
Moving to expenses, slide 9 highlights our operating cost discipline. Reported non-interest expense was $354
million. Adjusted non-interest expense of $306 million was up $5 million or 2% from the prior quarter and $12
million from the previous year, representing a 4% increase. Personnel expenses were flat sequentially, benefited
by our head count reductions during the second and third quarters. Reported non-interest expenses were
impacted by an $18 million voluntary early retirement charge and the $31 million loss from the loan sales during
the quarter. A $47 million special FDIC assessment should be incurred in the fourth quarter.
Importantly, we will remain quite proactive with disciplined expense management in this revenue-challenged
environment. We implemented reductions in a voluntary early retirement program in the second and third
quarters, which supported a nearly 4% company-wide reduction in the head count. In addition, and as Kevin
mentioned, we have several expense rationalization initiatives in various areas underway, which should keep our
adjusted non-interest expenses relatively flat year-over-year in 2024. There will be more underlying details of
these initiatives discussed at forthcoming industry conferences during the fourth quarter.
Moving to slides 11 and 12 on the credit quality, as expected, credit losses have risen over the past two quarters,
primarily from idiosyncratic charge-offs. The 3 basis point increase and $6 million growth in our allowance for
credit losses primarily reflects loan migration trends and an uncertain economic environment. Excluding the
medical office building loan sale, net charge-offs were 40 basis points compared to our 30 to 40 basis points
guidance for the second half of this year. Approximately, 50% of third quarter charge-offs, excluding the medical
office building loan sale were attributable to a previously disclosed shared national C&I credit totaling $23 million.
Non-performing loans increased modestly to 0.64% as credit metrics migrate from historically low levels. Total
criticized and classified credits rose slightly, but are still a manageable 3.4% of total loans. We expect net charge-
offs to average loans to be 30 to 40 basis points in the fourth quarter. We continue to have a high degree of
confidence in the strength and quality of our loan portfolio. We will continue to apply our conservative underwriting
practices and advance marketing analytics to new loan originations and portfolio monitoring and management.
As seen on slide 13, our capital position continue to increase in the third quarter with the common equity Tier 1
ratio reaching 10.13% and with total risk-based capital now at 13.12%. Retained earnings and strategic
transactions supported 27 basis points of capital accretion in third quarter. In addition, the proceeds from the third
quarter, third party indirect auto and medical office building loan sales allowed us to reduce our level of wholesale
funding and total commercial real estate exposure.
Even though Synovus have achieved it's greater than 10% CET1 target, we will continue to preserve our capital
over the near-term, given there's still a fair amount of macroeconomic uncertainty. Moreover, there should be
more limited capital accretion in the fourth quarter as a result of the expected $47 million FDIC special
assessment. Of course, we will regularly reassess the economic environment and consider if any opportunistic
capital management may be appropriate in the future.
I'll now turn it back to Kevin to discuss our guidance.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
Thank you, Jamie. I'll now continue with our updated fundamental guidance for the remainder of 2023. Loan
growth is still expected to be 0% to 2% for the 2023 year. We expect fourth quarter loan production to be at
similar levels to third quarter, which remains muted versus 2022. Growth in the current quarter should be fueled
by continued success in middle market and Corporate and Investment Banking, as well as draws on construction
lines.
We maintain our expectations for core deposit growth of 1% to 3% as the company strives to balance loan and
core deposit growth and will be aided by the previously mentioned seasonal tailwinds and new funding growth
initiatives. The revenue growth outlook for 2023 is 1% to 2%, which assumes a Fed funds rate of 5.5% that holds
through the end of the year. Deposit betas are now expected to reach 46% to 47% by year-end versus 42% in the
third quarter.
We have lowered our adjusted expense growth expectations to approximately 4% to 5% in 2023 versus previous
expectations of 4% to 6%. Please note that the non-interest expense guidance does not reflect the impact of the
upcoming $47 million FDIC special assessment expected to be incurred in the fourth quarter. While the
environment has resulted in strategic shifts in priorities, we remain confident in our growth strategies and we
continue to remain diligent in expense management. Over the course of the year, we have reduced our guidance
range as we have implemented various expense initiatives.
Moving to capital, we are now at our target CET1 level. At this time, we think it is prudent to maintain that target
and continue to build capital over the near-term, given there's still a fair amount of uncertainty in the
macroeconomic environment. We still anticipate the tax rate should approximate 22% in 2023, supported by
recent federal tax investments.
At Synovus, we are focused on execution and closing out 2023 in a strong fashion. We remain optimistic that,
through the actions we have taken, we are better positioned to overcome the short-term headwinds and to
strengthen the bank's foundation for return to growth as we proceed through 2024.
And now, operator, let's open the call for a Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first
question we have comes from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Good morning, Ebrahim.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Maybe a question, Kevin, on the credit quality. So, I appreciate that there's a – no hit from one credit in the third
quarter, but just looking at the criticized loans and the 3.4%, I'm not sure if that's impacted by that or not, but just
talk to us around your sense of where credit is headed? You've spent a decade talking about just the cleanup that
has happened in the castle and then, under you, on the credit quality side post-GFC. So, give us a sense of, one,
where you think credit is headed from a macro perspective over the next 12 months? And then, within your loan
book, where are you seeing stress, like what should we expect from the outside in terms of potential lumpiness in
credit cost over the coming quarters? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
So, Ebrahim, there's a lot of questions in that one question. But let me take it from the start and I'll let Bob add in
some comments around credit. But we've been talking for some time about normalization and moderation of credit
cost. And that comes off, as you know, some of the lowest levels of credit cost and metrics that we've seen in
many, many years. And what you're seeing this quarter was we've talked a lot about and publicly disclosed is one
large credit that charged off, which was a syndicated credit. And even with that credit, we're still within the
guidance that we provided during the second quarter where we noted 30 basis points to 40 basis points in the
second half of the year.
So, although credit is moderating, we believe that it's still very manageable. It's within the ranges that we had
anticipated. And I'll be honest with you, that large transaction, the loss content in that was not fully considered
when we gave that guidance. So, that tells you that in general, our credit cost came in a little less than what we
would have anticipated. So, it's manageable. We still believe that the second half of the year will be 30 basis
points to 40 basis points, excluding the loan sales. Yes, there's been some increases in NPLs and criticized and
classified, but I think that comes with the territory.
As you see in this environment, many of our clients are having their margins compressed by the recessionary and
inflationary efforts that are – or numbers that are happening and that results in things being downgraded. But
again, it's all within a manageable range. And when you look at it for the full year, we still think we're going to
come in between that 25 basis points and 30 basis points. So, for all the discussions that we're talking about, net
charge-offs, there's really just a modest increase over what we've seen in previous years.

And Bob, what would you add to that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, Ebrahim, hi. It's Bob. I wouldn't add much other than to say, we just – it's just general normalization
particularly in our corporate businesses that recall that we have about 60% of our balance sheet is made up of
wholesale corporate businesses and for years, those numbers were extremely low. So, as they move back into
sort of normal territory, as it relates to credit cost, it kind of pushes your number in that 30 basis points to 40 basis
points range, as Kevin said, I think that's a reasonable expectation for us. And overall stress is in some of these
portfolios, but nothing that we don't feel like is manageable.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Noted. And I guess maybe one for you, Jamie around – give us a sense of deposit pricing as we move into next
year? Just competitively, what are you seeing in the market? Are things getting easier or are they as competitive
as they were earlier in the summer? And maybe if you can talk to just the asset side of the balance sheet around
potential offsets with some of the fixed rate low assets repricing? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Ebrahim, I think you're the champion of multiple questions in one. Let me make sure – I hope I'll answer them on
this, but I'll start with deposit production and what are we seeing there? If you look at the rate of deposits, the
going on production quarter-on-quarter, we were up 12 basis points, quarter-on-quarter right around $370 million,
was the cost of deposit production, in third quarter. And what's included in that is a little more than 20 basis points
increase in the cost of CD production. So, that's around 4.7%.
But the rate pressure on CDs has been a little bit reduced recently in the month of September, so we feel good
about that. And then on other interest bearing deposits, we saw in MAA, production come down about 11 basis
points quarter-on-quarter. We saw the now production down almost – approximately 75 basis points quarter-on-
quarter. So, we feel good about the trends of deposit production within our interest-bearing products.
Mix will be a impact there going forward. So, all in, I would say the deposit production cost increases in the fourth
quarter will probably be similar to what we saw in the third quarter. But, for overall deposit costs, we gave our
guidance of 46% to 47% through-the-cycle beta. So, we expect continued increases in the fourth quarter and that,
actually has a little bit less to do with the production than it has to do with repricing in the existing book. And I
would point to the table we put on page 7 of the earnings deck with the fixed rate repricing. What you see below
the line there is the impact of the CD repricing.
In the fourth quarter, it has a decent-sized impact of CD maturities. So, we have a little more than $2 billion in
CDs that mature in the fourth quarter. The rate on those today is about 3.75%. And so, we will have a headwind
to deposit costs in the fourth quarter as those reprice kind of the normal going on production rate. We do expect
further declines in non-interest-bearing deposits in the fourth quarter. And so, we think that the net result of all of
that is you get to that 46% to 47% through-the-cycle beta for the month of December and deposit costs in the year
in the mid- to upper-2.50s.

And, you asked about the asset side of the balance sheet, will you remind me, was that the rate on the asset
side?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Yeah. I was just wondering in terms of the churn, the repricing that we're going to see and the magnitude of that
next year, whether that could be [indiscernible] (00:25:38) growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, as we look at looking forward next year, so we'll have a few things happen. First, going back to the
liability side, we think that deposit cost, total deposit costs will peak in – or flat line starting in early 2024. But then
you start to see the benefit of the fixed rate asset repricing and you can see that on that same chart with the fixed
rate assets and you see how that impact just grows as you go through the year.
So, we expect the margin to decline in the fourth quarter, be relatively stable in the first quarter. And then,
because the impact of CD repricing is a couple million dollars incrementally each quarter, when you go through
2024, that will be easily overwhelmed by the benefits of the fixed rate commercial loan repricing, securities
portfolio, hedge runoff and residential mortgage repricing. And you can see that in the chart that it's pretty
powerful as you go through 2024 as a nice tailwind to both NII and the margin.

So, I want to start on the ability to generate positive operating leverage in 2024. On the expense side, Kevin, you
said you planned to hold adjusted expenses pretty flat in 2024, so hoping first you give a little color on that. And
then, I also want to talk about the revenue opportunity and at this juncture, do you see 2024 as an opportunity to
show very modest operating leverage, do you think it could be more substantial. We will start there?

Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Steve, let me take this off. As we look longer term – well, first, I'll speak to our communications strategy for
the fourth quarter, so, in the next six weeks, we'll be out with a couple of different presentations. And we have
today, where we're speaking to the third quarter and the fourth quarter and then, we'll be presenting it at BAAB or
give more of a strategic update and including some of the details of our expense initiatives; and then, we have the
Goldman Sachs Conference in early December, where we will give more details of our financial outlook longer
term.
But when you look at where we are right now on expenses. So, in the very near-term, we expect expenses to be
down in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. We had a range of $302 million to $306 million on adjusted
expenses. And then, as we said, we expect adjusted expenses to be relatively stable in 2024. Of course, we're
excluding the FDIC onetime assessment that we expect to come in the fourth quarter. We have a lot of different
initiatives behind that flat expense guidance. And, really, what's exciting to us is a lot of it just improves how we
go-to-market, and embedded in that expense outlook is still spending for growth to grow our core client base. So,
what you'll see from us is, you'll see, in our businesses that drive core relationship growth, you'll still see spending
to grow. And so, that's embedded in our strategy and we'll speak more to that in a couple of weeks up in Boston.
And so, we feel good about that outlook. But when you think about positive operating leverage for the calendar
year 2024, it's challenging because the first half of 2023 had such strong revenue growth that the exit run rate on
revenue is just simply lower than it was at the entry to 2023. But when you look at quarterly increases and it goes
back to Ebrahim's question just a minute ago, the NII tailwinds because of fixed rate repricing and where yields
are today is very powerful. And so, while we may not have positive operating leverage for calendar year 2024, if
you're comparing quarter-on-quarter, year-over-year, it gets pretty powerful as you go through calendar year
2024. The issue is simply, just looking at calendar year 2024 versus calendar year 2023.

Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just one other one. So, on the non-interest bearing deposits are down fairly
sharply again, peers are seeing the pace of outflows to be fairly materially. How close are you to seeing a
bottom? And when you talk about your expectation for NIM to stabilize in 1Q and then expand, what's the
underlying assumption of where non-interest bearing deposits are? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Our outlook for NIB to total remains the same as we said in July. And so, we expect to end the year around 25%
non-interest bearing to total deposits and embedded in that would be a decline in the fourth quarter, somewhere
around $400 million in NIB deposits. We do believe that that rate of decline will slow significantly as we look out
into 2024. And again, we'll give more details on the longer-term outlook in early December. But we do believe that
that will slow and that's due to both environmental impacts as well as strategic impacts with our businesses that
we're continuing to grow like treasury and payment solutions.

Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Rose from Raymond James. You may proceed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just a broader step-back question for you,
Kevin. Obviously, a lot has happened since the Investor Day earlier last year. Can you just give us an update on,
some of your initiatives, whether it be Maast or the commercial real estate initiative and just broadly, where you
think you stand in some of those efforts and kind of maybe some of the areas that might require some additional
kind of investment from you? Obviously, the targets that you laid out back then, I think, are going to be tough to
achieve in this interest rate environment, but just wanted to get a sense for where you think you are and what the
opportunities are as we move forward? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, Michael. It's a great question and I think part of the answer is that, with this sort of environment, where
you're seeing margin contraction, you're seeing questions around credit, it kind of masks some of the success that
we've had in some of the underlying initiatives. And that's not just with our new initiatives, it also stands to talk
about some of our core businesses that continue to see improvements in productivity, deepening the wallet share,
things like that. But, as it relates to our targets, I would just tell you, as we've said in the past, when we did that
forecast for our three-year top quartile performance, obviously, we did it under a different interest rate
environment, our goal is to continue to focus on generating top quartile performance, and those numbers may be
different but, relatively speaking, outperforming that of our competitors.
But, when it gets into some of the initiatives, something like a Maast. When we talk about our banking as a
service platform, one of the things that we set out from the beginning was, we wanted to prove a hypothesis that
this was a solution that would be well-received by independent software vendors and partners. As I said on the
last call, I think we're proving that hypothesis pretty clearly, in that we've already on boarded nine ISVs and
payment partners onto the platform. Today, the spend of the payment facilitation portion of that is approaching
$500 million. And we have additional 45 partners in the pipeline evaluating the software and going through the
contractual phase. Those 45 partners would represent about $13 billion in payment volume. So, it shows that
there's a great deal of interest in the Maast solution.
The second part of that objective was ensuring that we had the right type of products to be able to fully offer the
capabilities that the end users would desire. Today, we have payment facilitation and a banking suite of products
that include checking and a debit card. But we just announced this week we signed a strategic partnership with
Fintainium, which will provide additional AP/AR capabilities to the end user. So, as we entered this, we had just a
minimum viable product, we're expanding that into additional solutions.
The third leg of the stool is, we have to assess whether the utilization and the adoption by the end users will
generate a great deal of revenue. And that's the part of this equation that it's still too early to tell. But based on the
demand that we have from the software providers, we remain very optimistic as to the viability of this solution.
And we're actually expanding it into a banking-only solution where some folks actually don't need the payment
facilitation, they just want the banking services and that's about 40% of the pipeline we have today.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
I think it's also important to note, we're not betting the bank on this initiative. We've spent about $9 million in
expenses year-to-date and so, it's a measured investment for us. CIB, Corporate and Investment Banking, we
have about 27 FTEs, we're up to 20 clients that we've been able to onboard. We have almost $500 million in
outstandings and $3 million in revenue year-to-date from a capital market standpoint. So, that is progressing, we
continue to get traction. And that's just going to take time to continue to build, but it is exceeding our expectations
from a P&L impact at this point. Again, we've spent about $8 million year-to-date, so we're not betting the farm on
any one of these initiatives, it's really the combination of many.
And the third one I'll just mention is analytics. We talked a lot about analytics and the importance at providing
proactive advice to our clients both on the commercial and consumer side. We're fully up and operational with our
consumer platform. And year-to-date, we booked about $10 million in incremental revenue just from some of the
leads and insights that that solution has provided us and that's just starting to scratch the surface.
So, some of the big initiatives that we rolled out in February in Investor Day are ahead of schedule. Again, small
numbers in the grand scheme of things. But as I said then, I'll say again today, it's really not about the P&L impact
today, it's about the impact two and three years down the road where it's going to create new sources of revenue
that we haven't had. And let me just – I'm answering this long-winded, but let me add in one new one and I
referenced this in the prepared remarks, but we're currently in discussions with GreenSky and the private equity
firms that are acquiring the GreenSky platform from Goldman. Our discussions around a sponsorship program
that would allow us to continue to support their origination and distribution of production with a balance sheet light
liquidity neutral solution.
And as a reminder, I know you know this, Michael, we've been in business with GreenSky on a held for sale
arrangement since 2020. That continued with Goldman after the acquisition, but it was only on a small portion of
their originations, which this quarter created only about $1 million in revenue. The new program that we're
contemplating is not built into our 2023 guidance and would have a much broader program across all of the
production. And we'll be very excited about sharing specifics about that banking as a service program and the
financial benefits in the coming months.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Kevin, that's a great color. And maybe just kind of following up to that, Jamie, I understand that the positive
operating leverage is going to be pretty challenged next year, but just given this forthcoming arrangement with
GreenSky, I think third party loans are down to about 1.8% of the total. Should we expect a higher level of
balance sheet growth as we think about the next year, obviously, 0% to 2%? Given this quarter's production
seems a little bit light, it seems like you have some momentum. I just wanted to get a sense, I know it's early, if we
could expect a more robust balance sheet growth as we move into next year? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Michael, as we look further out and, again, we'll give a more detailed outlook here in about six weeks, but
as we look further out, we do expect balanced loan and deposit growth, and what you'll see there is, you'll see
that our core client businesses will continue to grow and our objectives there to grow faster than the market. We
believe that we have a right to win. We believe we can take share. And so, that's our objective in our core client
businesses, but you may see some other businesses that remain flat or even decline on the margin that are non-
core and – non-core multi-product clients. And so, you'll see a little bit of a mix there over the next few quarters as
we go forward.

Good morning, Brady.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So, you have a common equity Tier 1 of over 10% now. And, as I think about the future, it's probably not going to
be a lot of growth, you're still making good money. So, that ratio is still going to creep higher. And the stock is
sitting here barely on top of tangible book value, so do you think that sometime in 2024 it makes sense to
consider reengaging in the share repurchase program?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Brady, first, as you're well aware, we've been in capital accumulation mode now for about six quarters, and we've
achieved those objectives that we raised a while back to get above 10%, to your point. So, now we are in capital
management mode. So, our priority in that, is just what it's always been in the past, is deploying that capital to
clients. But beyond that, we will manage our capital ratios as appropriate, including the use of share repurchases.
And right now, we believe two things are important for that discussion.
First, in the fourth quarter, if you assume that we have that FDIC fee, we do not expect to accrete a lot of capital
in the fourth quarter. Second, we believe there's still a lot of economic uncertainty. So, where we are right now,
we're going to sit on the sideline likely here in the fourth quarter. But in 2024, we'll be balanced like you've seen
with us in the past, we've been in capital management mode, prioritizing clients and then secondarily, you'd likely
see us with share repurchases.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. That's helpful. And then, my second question is just on the path of the NIM, like, I understand it's down a
little bit more in 4Q and then stable and then you're starting to see some expansion, especially in the back half of
the year. If I look at that slide 7 where you suggest 23 basis points of NIM expansion, I know that's only looking at

like the fixed rate piece of it. So, is there any way to look at the entire company and gauge, what the possible NIM
expansion could be after we reach this, 3% bottom?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Well, let me – for today's purposes, let's go through what is not on that fixed rate chart. And so, first, what that
does not include would be any mix shifts in deposits, between the non-interest bearing and the interest bearing, or
even within the products that are within interest bearing. It doesn't include the headwind of deposit production
costs. And, as I mentioned, production for us was around 3.70% in the third quarter, which is clearly higher than
our total deposit costs. It would not include any deposit product rate increases. And so, all of our guidance is a flat
rate forward look. And so, we're not really expecting any material product rate increases, but if they were to
happen, it would not include that.
And then, it also doesn't include the impact of the loan spreads, and I want to point to something there because
the loan spreads have been a really good story for us. We've had six consecutive quarters where the floating rate
loan spreads to index have widened. And so, we believe that we're getting paid for the risk we're putting on the
balance sheet. We believe it's accretive to capital. And so, that's a good trend there. So, those four things are not
included in that. Now, because the first three were negative so, I mean, it's likely that those are a little bit more
headwinds, they are tailwinds to what you see on the fixed rate repricing, but the trend should have a similar
shape is, what you see on that chart.

Thanks and Good morning. I had a question for Bob on the kind of the combined SNC portfolio and club and
purchase business. Where do you want that to go as next year comes into focus, it's more about kind of where do
you think that will land in the future?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Hi, Chris. Thanks for the question. Right now we're at around 10% of our total loans is our SNC book. And
that's what would be defined as sort of the official SNC definition. We also have another 2% or 3%, a little over $1
billion in what I would call, sort of club syndicated deals, more of a regional level. So, you kind of take those two
together. We're sitting around 13%, 10% of that being sort of true SNCs. Of that number, we're agenting around
$500 million of that. So, for what that's worth, we think that's good fee business for us, et cetera.
I think we're comfortable in this range in terms of percentage and relative to concentration limits, we kind of like
that 10% to 12% range, we're sort of there. I think that's our expectation is, we kind of manage the business going
forward. We've been in this space a long time. Obviously, it can bite you occasionally, as you saw. But
nonetheless, we think we've got a really good group of bankers running that business, very focused on
opportunities that that book can present us and there are some. And we feel like we'll just be more strategic there.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
We're starting to see some deposit flows. They're still immaterial at this point, because with the $500 million
payment transactions that I referenced, that money moves pretty quickly. So, the deposit story and the revenue
that will come with it will make about $3 million in revenue in Maast this year. So, it's still in the infancy stage,
Chris.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Great. But a year from now, we can probably talk more definitively about progress there, just to think about...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah, yeah. I think as you see the payment facilitation business pick up and I think it's important to note with that
business, we've been intentional about slowly onboarding clients. That's why we talk about only having nine on
the platform and 40-plus in the waiting room just because we want to make sure that we get the product right. And
to your point, once we start onboarding some of these new relationships, we talked about getting a $0.5 billion to
$1 billion in deposits just from the payment facilitation business. And if we expand it into the banking only side,
there's obviously a lot more in deposits that are at play there as well.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
So, Jamie, I want to take another angle at the expectation for NIM expansion in the back half of next year and you
already laid out your assumptions. But could you just know – how you're thinking about kind of what you think the
biggest risk is to that potentially being pushed out or maybe not being realized according to your current
expectations?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
I think the biggest risk when you think about the margin out there, well, I would say versus Fed policy. And so, if
you have big moves on either side of Fed policy with their balance sheet, if they were to draw down the RRP
significantly and take a lot of liquidity out of the system, I think that could be challenging for the banking industry.
But then also, if they were to start easing in the second half of next year, the same lag that benefited the industry
on the way up would be a headwind. And so, if you're just simply looking at the margin at the end of next year, if
you assume that the Fed starts easing in the second half or the third quarter of next year, then that will be a
headwind.
Now, I would argue it's a temporary headwind because of the lag. And, as we've said before, we believe that our
sensitivity to the front-end of the curve in an easing cycle was relatively flat, so we would not expect that in itself
to contract the margin, but the lag would definitely be impactful, whenever that happens. So, that policy is a risk.
And then, I would say, just general deposit mix shifts are a risk. And we're pleased with the trend of the slowing
decline in NIB in the third quarter. We expect the decline to slow again in the fourth quarter and then slow again
into 2024, but that's – I would point to those as some of the risks to that outlook.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. Very helpful. And then, a follow up to your commentary on the loan spreads and how does it impact the
loan growth profile of the bank? You also mentioned that you expect to grow faster than the market and you
would think, I guess, with the higher loan spread maybe that would slow down the growth theoretically, but could
you just help us square away those items?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Well, Brandon, I'll take that. I think those two are not necessarily correlated in that. What we're doing today in the
marketplace is, we're just being more selective at where we want to lend capital, and that allows us with the
competition pulling back a little bit, it allows us to pull up our pricing. And, as Jamie mentioned, when you look at
the variable rate spread over index, we're up 80 basis points year-over-year.
When we look into the future, and a lot of the loan growth will be based on where demand goes, we talked a lot
about production, was off about 9% this quarter over last quarter. Pipelines are relatively flat right now. The
economic impact to demand will determine kind of how fast we grow loans. And as Jamie mentioned earlier, we
will also want to correlate that back to the similar level of growth we'll see on deposits. But what we're optimistic
about is our ability to continue to grow C&I loans through our CIB organization, through middle market and
through some of our specialty areas.
Maybe the one question mark and wild card for 2024 will be what happens with the payoff, pay down activity in
CRE? As you know, we haven't seen a very constructive marketplace there given where cap rates and interest

rates have moved and so we haven't had a lot of payoffs and pay downs. So, our production next year in CRE, it
may be hard to keep up with some of the payoff and pay downs that have delayed through this cycle. But we're
just as bullish on the areas that we can grow and as you noted, our goal is to continue to exceed the rate of
growth of the underlying economy.

Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Hey. Good morning, everyone. Just a quick question on the bond portfolio. Some banks have pulled the trigger on
restructuring. Is that something that is on the table or would you focus more on just doing what you've been doing,
using the cash flows to help fund loan growth or perhaps pay down wholesale bonds? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Kevin, as we look at the bond portfolio, we would consider restructuring. I don't think it would be incredibly
significant. I mean, you think about the capital that we have, that we call excess capital of being at 10.13%,
there's limitations to how we would use that capital and how much we would use on something like a bond
restructuring. But, I think, similar to what you've heard from others in the industry, if there's a restructuring that
makes sense and you get a 2-year payback, a 2.5-year payback or something like that, it could be something that
we entertain. But at this point today, we don't have any intention to do that, but it's something that we do look at
from time to time.

Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Great. Thanks. And one quick follow up. On the sale on that GLOBALT, I think you mentioned that – about
streamlining your – I forgot the exact wording you used, but about streamlining. And so, I'm just wondering if you
can add a little more color on was it competing with some other – the banks, more larger wealth management
platform or what was it about it that made you want to streamline with that sale? Thanks.

Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Kevin, I think we said simplification of our business model, and it's really – it's a money management firm
that we've owned for some time. And so, it didn't really compete. It actually served as an investment vehicle for
our financial advisors to place money. They largely do ETF funds. And, as you know, in that sort of business, we'll
continue to use them and partner with them as we look to move our clients' assets under management into the
best products for optimizing their returns, but it's a high efficiency business and we believe that we can take the
operating expense from that and put it back into either the front-end of the wealth origination, so the financial

advisors or the private wealth advisors, or we can put it in other businesses and earn more from an efficiency

returns.

Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. I wanted to...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
...circle back – I wanted to circle back to your commentary about NII, and NIM in an easing Fed cycle. I appreciate
the color on a lagging deposit base. I'm just wondering, given the fixed rate repricing schedule versus variable
rate loans that would go down a little bit more quickly. Is that an offsetting element or could we actually see some
NIM compression over the first couple of quarters following a slight easing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
In that scenario, it depends on the timing. I would have to think through. But I mean, you think about the
immediacy of loan repricing. We have a little more than 60% of our loans are floating rate that would repriced
immediately and then the deposits would lag in it. So, about 20% of our deposits would also reprice immediately. I
mean, they're – you could think of them as index based, even if they're not all directly indexed based. It would
likely lead to a decline in the margin for those periods, for those early Fed ease time periods.
Now, that being said, this fixed rate repricing, this chart doesn't just – it wouldn't just end in the fourth quarter
2024 like we displayed here. That continues for multiple years, because you think about those exposures,
especially when you look at residential mortgages, you look at the securities portfolio, we continue to benefit
incrementally way beyond this. And so – this time period. So, this benefit will overcome that headwind of that lag
headwind when the Fed does start to ease, that'll be a temporary issue. And so, we have a long-term benefit from
fixed rate repricing. And at some point, if you do assume the Fed's next move as an ease, there will be a
headwind for a couple quarters.

Okay. That makes sense. And then just looking at the timing of some of the loan sales and other PPNR activities
over the last couple of quarters, maybe just talk through the cadence on NII over the next quarter or two. Does

that cadence follow margin or is there something within the timing of recent sales that maybe we see NII
performance a little bit better than what the expected margin performance would be at least in the next quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
It will trend along with the margin, so you'll see a decline in the fourth quarter and then flat in the first quarter. And
then you'll see NII growing with the combination of loan growth as well as margin expansion as you go through
2024.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning, everyone.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Good morning, Brody.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Jamie, I think I've got it, but I just wanted to put a finer a point on the guidance with the revenues. The guide kind
of implies that we step down a bit more than I would have expected in the fourth quarter, just with the NIM
commentary and some of the fees. Is there something that I'm missing, because I think it implies like about a $25
million step-down in operating revenues?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
So, Brody, I think that what you're looking at there is really in fee revenue. And so, we had fee revenue of $106
million in the third quarter, and that included $2.5 million of GLOBALT revenue. So, when you adjust for that, our
fee revenue in the third quarter was around $103 million to $104 million. And so, looking forward to the fourth
quarter, there will be an incremental headwind in NIR on the retail side because of the deposit fees, but we expect
to overcome that headwind, and we expect to be flat to slightly up from the $103 million to $104 million in the
fourth quarter. And then, on the NII, as we mentioned, we expect the margin to decline in a similar amount as
what you saw in the third quarter, but then you also have the impact, the full quarter impact of the sale of the
medical office portfolio.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And, just to clarify on the revenue component, Jamie, I think, if I was reading the slide correctly, that
the expectation around the beta is like more of like a spot in December kind of expectation for the beta and not
the average for the quarter, correct?

That's correct. It's the month of December.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Cool. Can I just follow up on Bob's – well, [indiscernible] (00:58:52) next real quick, Bob. Did you happen to
have what percent of that SNC portfolio you guys are the lead underwriter on?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Brody, on the SNC portfolio, it's about $500 million. So, of that $4.3 billion, we're the agent on about $500
million.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you for that. And then, I did just have a couple of last quick ones. Bob, do you happen to have the
ACL on the office portfolio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. We don't – I'll let Jamie follow up with you, Brody. But from a allowance perspective, we don't disclose by
asset class. Just generally speaking, our CRE allowance, in the 1.5% range in general. But then within that
obviously the asset classes are broken down. But our office portfolio today where criticized and classified is less
than 10%. NPLs are 1.5%. So, in the context of the size of that portfolio, it's relatively stable. Now, we're not – we
obviously see – we have a watchlist there. We've been working that. We've talked about that before. But right now
the performance is relatively stable and the allocation just follows the CRE allocation.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Jamie Gregory Jr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
And Brody, one thing about that portfolio is, as Bob mentioned, we've seen no new net negative migration in the
office portfolio in the third quarter. It continues to perform and the watchlist remains the same as we discussed in
July and before. And so, that portfolio continues to kind of perform as we expected. When you think about the
allowance in the categories, any sort of migration obviously impacts the life of loan loss estimate for the portfolio.
But what we saw in the third quarter when we ran the allowance was, the allowance to loan ratio within CRE was
relatively stable for the quarter. Where we saw the increases was in C&I and small business. And so we feel good
about what we can see in front of us. We believe it aligns with that 30 to 40 basis point charge-off guide for the
fourth quarter and we'll continue to give updates as we see more clear outlook.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And then just one last one, Bob, just on the senior housing portfolio, you guys have built that into a pretty
good business line for yourselves and I think if I'm remembering correctly, it's performed extremely well for you
from a credit perspective versus some other banks that have maybe struggled a little bit just with that generic kind
of category of senior housing. Could you maybe help us better understand the puts and takes around that

portfolio and why yours kind of outperforms relative to some other banks that also have a senior housing
exposure?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Sure, Brody. Thanks for the question. Just a couple of comments on it. We've been in this business a long
time. We have a very experienced team that manages this book. You're right, it's around $4 billion. We think
about it today, it is certainly feeling some stress and there's no question about that as it relates to increased labor
cost, certainly the interest rates staying higher here in the last six months or so, continue to put some stress on it.
But the positives here are, as an industry, this industry's continuing to see increased occupancy rates. Most of our
operators have implemented increased rental rates. So, the revenue top line improvement is there, it's just not, it's
going to take some time for it to overcome the rapid increase in cost.
As it specifically relates to our credit performance in this portfolio, we're sitting today at a criticized, classified ratio
around 10%. That number – 10% to 15%, that number could drift a little higher. But overall, we put a couple of
loans on a non-accrual this quarter, that was the increase in our non-accrual rate to 64 bps from 59 bps. But
again, that was within our expectation, we think the loss content here in those few credits is very manageable,
very low and is certainly within our guidance. So, overall, I think it's just client selection long-term in this business,
Brody. And the way the portfolio is performing, the way we underwrite, again, there's some stress but, overall, it's
performing within our expectations.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
And, Brody, I'd just add that, you know, when you look at this asset class, everybody assumes that all senior
housing looks the same, some more in memory care, skilled nursing, some are more private pay. I think, to Bob's
point, client selection here, dealing with long-term operators, more private pay, less skilled nursing has resulted in
better overall performance. So, I think that's a big driver of that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, guys. Thanks for the time. I guess, I wanted to think about maybe the loss-given default rates around credit
and kind of how you think about the different buckets. I think with that SNC credit, a lot of people were surprised
22

just the ability for that to have such severity. So, I'm just kind of wondering how you think about that within the
SNC book and maybe within the other categories as you look at credit overall?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah. Stephen, I'll make a couple of comments there. Obviously, loss-given default, in that particular case, was
way outside of the norm. We do consider that to be an idiosyncratic event. Obviously, we spend a lot of time and
have spent a lot of time dissecting that specific credit and going back and looking at our processes and
procedures, et cetera. Our conclusion from all of that work is that we still have good processes. Our underwriting
was sound. Just a number of events that took place in that credit, they quite frankly all went the wrong way and all
happened over a period of time that just led to a very outsized and loss-given default that would certainly not be
normal for us.
From our perspective, generally speaking, we look at leverage loans, we look at enterprise value-based loans, we
underwrite those. Generally speaking, to get inside of the assets, the hard assets within a couple of years, those
are the kind of – when you think about whilst given default on those loans, that's where you risk is. Our general
underwriting guideline is to get the cash into the – pay the loan down as quickly as we can, not rely on that
enterprise value for any period of time. Generally, we have third party valuations, et cetera, but to stay short with
exposure to enterprise value. Leverage loans for us around $2 billion, we certainly manage it very closely and
stay spot on with our reporting. So, that's a little bit of rambling, Stephen, but does that help on how we look at
those types of credits?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah, I think that helps. But I mean, I guess generally you don't really view that segment or maybe C&I more
broadly as having any terrible risk from a severity perspective at this point relative to this area, is that fair to say?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert W. Derrick A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Synovus Financial Corp.
I think that's fair to say, yes. We certainly could ignore that business and not do it, but we've chosen to do it over
time. We think selectively we can make good returns there and manage the credit risk appropriately.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
And I think I just add to Bob's comment, Steve, when you think about where there's a higher loss-given default in
C&I, generally if you're doing small business unsecured where we don't have a lot of exposure there. And then
when we think about our C&I, we're doing investment-grade credits and Bob's point, this credit that we're
referencing here is an anomaly. We generally have primary sources of repayment, secondary sources of
repayment. Many of these loans are recourse. And so, when you think about loss-given default in the C&I
business, they're generally low just based on the way that we underwrite those.
And when we talk about CRE and we're talking about having 50% LTVs or LTCs, similar scenario there where
you feel like you have enough equity and cushions of protection that would keep the loss-given defaults lower
over there. So, I think it would be erroneous to assume that all SNCs have much higher loss-given defaults based
on this one credit.

Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Great. Very helpful. And then just my other question is, you guys have talked about seeking out higher risk
adjusted returns, you've talked a bit about these spreads widening on floating rate credit. As you pursue those
endeavors, where do you think that leaves you from a segment perspective to be more active as we move into
2024?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
I missed that again, Steve. What was that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Just kind of as you seek out higher risk adjusted returns, where does that lead you segment-wise? Where
do you think...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
...much of that growth will come from as a result? I guess, where are those returns hiding, if you will?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin S. Blair A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
No. It's a great question. And it starts with, if you're doing a loan-only relationship, I would argue that it's hard to
say that you're getting great returns unless you're taking a lot of risk. So, we're not suggesting that. We're
suggesting that where we're focus is on the businesses, where we have the opportunity and the right to win by
providing a full set of solutions, not just the lending piece. So, we're getting cross-sell on the depository treasury
side, we're getting personal relationships from the business owners. And so, where you see that our middle
market commercial today, we're doing very, very well with that. Our core commercial kind of our community,
commercial, our small business areas and even in Corporate and Investment Banking unit where we're going to
market and industry verticals, we're able to bring capital markets and additional fee income and treasury and
deposits where it makes those returns much higher.
So, we talked in the past that we've kind of double down in the commercial space, that's where we're winning
market share. But when you go to the consumer side, we're focused on the mass affluent and affluent segments
where we believe that not only advice matters, but we have a personal touch that allows us to get a greater share
of wallet. So, that's where we're focused. It's relationship banking 101, so it doesn't sound real sexy, but it comes
down to delivery and how we do that and that's why we win things like J.D. Power and Greenwich, because we do
it really, really well.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
And let me let me follow up on that J.D. Power and Greenwich, because a lot of this has to do with how do we
fund that growth and our success with our retail network, our success with our commercial banking. Deposit
production, when you look at the third quarter deposit production, we're up about 70% year-over-year. And then
when you decompose that, because clearly a lot of that comes from time deposits, from CD production, but even
when you back that out and when you look at interest bearing non-maturity deposit production, so now an MMA
deposit production, those together are up over 10% year-over-year. So, that's a positive production trend is
sustained.
And then in the third quarter, we see we saw a reduction in account diminishment. So, on the consumer side, the
diminishment we saw in the third quarter relative to the second quarter down almost 60%. On the commercial
side, the same thing, down almost approximately 55% and this has been the big headwind year-to-date, so it's
good to see the pressure reducing on this.

Operator: Thanks. Thank you, Stephen. This concludes our question-and-answer session, and I would like to
turn the conference back over to Mr. Kevin Blair for any closing remarks. Thank you.

Kevin S. Blair
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Synovus Financial Corp.
Thank you. As we close out today's call, I want to thank everyone for their attendance and their interest in
Synovus. Despite a more challenging operating environment, Synovus continues to demonstrate strength,
resilience and flexibility. We've been proactive in executing on various initiatives to navigate the risks associated
with the recent interest rate and economic environment. Through our completed balance sheet optimization and
business simplification strategies, we've freed up capital, liquidity and operating expenses to pursue higher-
returning opportunities.
With rates expected to stay higher for longer, fixed asset rate repricing should support a NIM trough in the fourth
quarter and create a path to expansion in the second half of 2024. Somewhat masked by the margin contraction,
we are experiencing healthy, steady growth in areas like CIB, middle market, wealth management and treasury
and payment solutions. Continued growth in our core businesses, coupled with the traction on new sources of
revenue, 2024, we look forward to transitioning from a more defensive posture into one of growth.
Most importantly, we continue to believe that our strong underwriting, monitoring and client selection, as well as
the actions taken through the years to generate diversification and an economically vibrant southeastern footprint,
will result in manageable levels of credit losses over this economic cycle. Lastly, the company will continue to
maintain a very strong liquidity and capital position to allow for flexibility and ongoing uncertainty.
Thank you to our team members for your dedication and hard work each day. Synovus, and our talented team
members, continue to be recognized nationally. We were recently ranked 5th in Bank Director's Magazine Best
US Banks over $50 billion in assets analysis. I have a lot of optimism as certainty replaces uncertainty, and we

control what we can control, the outlook for NII is clearing up and we see a path to sustained repeatable balance
sheet and revenue growth. But I want to conclude today's session with a message of hope, hope for resolution,
healing and peace in the Middle East.
This situation is deeply concerning for many reasons, including the effect it has in the lives of many across our
region, many of who are close friends and valued clients. My thoughts and prayers are firmly with our Jewish
community and others who are in peril. And in my hope, I hope to see signs of resolution, and that will lead to true
healing and long-term peace.
With that operator, that concludes our third quarter 2023 earnings call.
