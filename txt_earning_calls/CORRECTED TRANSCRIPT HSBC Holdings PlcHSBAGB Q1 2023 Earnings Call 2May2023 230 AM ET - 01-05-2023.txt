Q1 2023 Earnings Call 02-May-2023
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Investor and Analysts Conference Call for
HSBC Holdings Plc's Q1 2023 Results. For your information, this conference is being recorded.
At this time, I will hand the call over to Mr. Richard O'Connor, Group Head of Investor Relations.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard O'Connor
Global Head-Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, operator. Good morning, good afternoon, everyone. Before I hand over to Noel, I want to give a quick
reminder of reporting changes that have taken effect this quarter. The numbers in the presentation today are on
an IFRS 17 basis, and thank you to all those who attended the teach-in in March. Our focus is now on reported
numbers, but we will call out and specify notable items. Our global businesses are still the primary basis of our
reporting but we have moved to legal entity rather than geographic regions as our secondary reporting line.
Consensus hasn't yet fully caught up with all these changes. But now we've made them, we believe they will give
you more clarity, transparency and ultimately benefit your modeling going forward.
Noel, over to you.

Noel Quinn
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks, Richard, and good morning in London, good afternoon in Hong Kong. And thank you for joining our first
quarter results call. Georges is going to lead the presentation, but I'd like to make some opening comments.
We've announced a strong set of Q1 results. We delivered a strong profit performance, which was spread across
all our major geographies. All three global businesses performed well, and cost discipline remained tight. In the
first quarter, excluding the gain on SVB UK on the part-reversal of the impairment on the potential sale of our
French retail bank, we delivered an annualized return on tangible equity of 19.3%. So, our strategy is working. I'm
also confident about the future for two main reasons. First, we have built a good platform for growth. We have a
strong balance sheet, broad base geographic profit generation, a good combination of net interest income and
non-net interest income, and a tight grip on costs.
This growth potential was evident in the inflow of new invested assets of $22 billion in the quarter, with a
cumulative $93 billion over the last 12 months, which shows that our wealth strategy is continuing to gain traction.
And you have my commitment that we will continue to drive strong performance for the rest of the year while
maintaining cost discipline and investing in growth.
The second reason I'm confident is the diversity and connectivity of our geographical footprint, where we have
access to markets that are exhibiting good growth and return potential. I've seen firsthand, the strong economic
recovery is underway in Hong Kong and mainland China. I've also visited the Middle East recently, where I saw a
strong economy that is well-placed to continue to grow. And the UK economy is also showing good resilience and
our HSBC UK business is performing well.
Investing in growth is critical and we saw an opportunity to do that by acquiring SVB UK. For 158 years, HSBC
has banked the entrepreneurs who have created today's industrial base. With the SVB UK acquisition, we have

access to more of the entrepreneurs in the technology and life sciences sectors, who will create the businesses of
tomorrow. We believe there are natural fit for HSBC and that we're well and uniquely placed to take them global.
You will have seen the recent hires that we've taken on in the US in that regard and we continue – and we're
going to continue to invest to grow this part of the business on a global basis. We announced that the sale of our
French retail bank has become less certain due to significant interest rate rises in France and the related fair
value accounts in treatment impacting the capital position of the purchaser.
We still believe it's right to sell the business, but we also have to keep our shareholders' interests in mind when
negotiating revised terms. We are working with the buyer to try and find a solution. But the uncertainty on deal
terms and timing has led us to reverse the impairment.
Finally, we made two important announcements today. The first was the resumption of quarterly dividends, with
an interim dividend of $0.10 per share, which is the same level as the last time we paid a first quarterly dividend
before COVID. The second was that good continued capital generation enabled us to announce a share buyback
of up to $2 billion.
Our AGM on Friday will be an important milestone. As you know, resolutions have been tabled by shareholders
on the strategy and structure of the bank, as well as to fix the dividends. The board has recommended that
shareholders vote against Resolutions 17 and 18. I believe our first quarter results reinforced our
recommendations and demonstrate that our current strategy is the fastest and safest way to improve returns.
I'll now hand over to Georges to take you through the numbers.

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Noel, and a warm welcome to all of you. Thank you for being with us on this call today. Let me begin
with the first quarter highlights. Profit before tax was $12.9 billion, up $9 billion on the first quarter of 2022 on a
constant currency basis. This was driven by an $8.6 billion increase in revenue, which includes $2.1 billion from
the part-reversal of the impairment relating to the potential sale of our retail banking operations in France and the
$1.5 billion provisional gain on the acquisition of SVB UK.
Credit performance was benign with expected credit losses of $0.4 billion. Costs were up 2% in the first quarter
against our 2023 target of limiting cost growth to circa 3% on a constant currency basis and excluding notable
items and hyperinflation. Our annualized return on tangible equity was 27.4% or 19.3%, excluding the gain on
SVB UK and the part reversal of the impairment on the potential sale of our French retail bank. And as Noel said,
we're providing strong capital returns in the form of the first quarterly dividend since 2019 of $0.10 per share and
a share buyback of up to $2 billion, which we expect to start after the AGM and complete in around three months.
Going into more detail. Net interest income of $9 billion was up $2.9 billion or 47% on the first quarter of 2022 and
was stable on the fourth quarter on an IFRS 17 basis. Non-net interest income of $11.2 billion was up $5.7 billion,
which includes $3.6 billion of notable items in the first quarter and was driven by strong performances in Markets
and Securities Services and in Wealth.
Lending balances increased by $32 billion in the quarter on a constant currency basis. This was made up of $25
billion from the reclassification of balances associated with our retail banking operations in France and $7.3 billion
from SVB UK. Deposits also increased in the quarter due to the same factors. If we excluded these items, lending
and deposits were both stable.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 02-May-2023
The tax charge of $1.9 billion included a credit of $0.4 billion and the CET1 ratio was 14.7%, which was an
increase of 50 basis points on the fourth quarter and included a 30-basis point gain relating to the part reversal of
the France impairment and the SVB UK acquisition. As Noel said, all of our global businesses performed well.
This slide gives you the evidence for that. Wealth and Personal Banking had a strong quarter with revenues up
82%. Within this, Wealth was up 13%, driven by the economic resurgence in Asia and increasing traction from the
investment we've made in digitization and in people. Personal Banking also had another good quarter, up 64%,
benefiting from our strong deposit franchise.
Across both Commercial Banking and Global Banking end markets, the Global Payments Services had revenues
of $4 billion, which was an increase of 176% on the first quarter of 2022. Global Banking end markets also
performed well overall. Markets and Securities Services revenue in particular were up 12%, with a strong
performance in foreign exchange.
Reported net interest income was $9 billion, which included $1.4 billion of interest expense due to the funding
costs booked in corporate center to fund the trading books. This was offset by $1.4 billion of non-net interest
income reported in Corporate Center. On a reported basis, the net interest margin was up by 50 basis points on
the first quarter of last year and up by 1 basis point on the fourth quarter.
For the avoidance of doubt, our net interest income guidance is unchanged from our 2022 full year results. On an
IFRS 17 basis, we expect to achieve net interest income of at least $34 billion in 2023. This is equivalent to at
least $36 billion of net interest income on an IFRS 4 basis, which was what we told you in February. Our current
view is that the things we told you about net interest income at our 2022 full year results remain unchanged. Non-
net interest income of $11.2 billion was up substantially by $5.7 billion, which was a combination of: one, $3.6
billion of notable items in the first quarter; two, a Global Banking end market's trading income increase of $0.4
billion; three, a $1.3 billion increase in Corporate Center income for funding Global Banking end markets trading
activity; and four, other income, which grew by $0.2 billion and included higher Wealth revenues.
Fees were broadly stable compared to the first quarter of 2022, with a good Payments fee performance, partially
offset by lower Wealth fees. However, net new invested assets in the quarter were $22 billion and $93 billion for
the last 12 months, which bodes well for future growth. I called out the global business revenue highlights earlier
and there is a detailed non-net interest income breakdown on slide 17.
Our credit performance in the quarter was benign with a $0.4 billion charge for expected credit losses, which was
$0.2 billion lower than the first quarter last year. This reflected a favorable shift in the probability weightings of our
economic downside scenarios as well as low Stage 3 losses. China CRE was also benign with a small charge
relating to technical adjustments for two customers. We saw no China CRE defaults in the quarter for the first time
since the fourth quarter of 2021, though, there were also limited repayments. We are encouraged by the first
quarter, but there are still downside risks, so our 2023 guidance remains unchanged at a charge of around 40
basis points of average gross customer lending, including held-for-sale balances. We will review this at our interim
results.
On a constant currency basis and excluding notable items, costs were up by 2% in the first quarter, once we also
exclude the impact of retranslating prior-year costs in hyperinflationary economies at constant currency. As you
can see, most of the spend was on technology. We remain committed to limiting cost growth to approximately 3%
in 2023 on that basis.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 02-May-2023
As I shared at the year end, one of my top priorities is cost discipline. Equally, I also shared that another of my top
priorities is to support our businesses to deliver growth and returns. The acquisition of SVB UK was an
opportunity to do that. This is expected to result in incremental cost growth of circa 1% to group operating
expenses, the majority of which is the acquired cost base of SVB UK, together with some additional investment in
the UK and other geographies. And this will be in addition to our 2023 target of limiting cost growth to circa 3%.
Finally, at year end, we also flagged $300 million of expected severance costs this year. A large portion of these
severance costs are now expected to be incurred in the second quarter with the cost benefits starting to come
through in the second half of this year.
Moving on, we usually include information on customer deposits in the appendix, but we have moved it up to the
presentation this time because we appreciate the current interest. Overall, customer deposits are stable year-on-
year and quarter-on-quarter. Of the $1.6 trillion of deposits we hold, half are invested in high-quality liquid assets,
which gives you a sense of our strong liquidity position. This is a historic feature of the way that HSBC manages
its balance sheet, and it has not changed. Around 40% of our high-quality liquid assets are held in cash or cash
equivalents, and there are only around $1.4 billion of unrealized losses in our held-to-collect portfolio, which is
down from around $1.9 billion at the end of 2022.
Three main points on capital. One, our CET1 ratio was 14.7%, up 50 basis points on the previous quarter. 25
basis points of which was from the reclassification of our French retail business from held-for-sale. Pending the
outcome of negotiations for our French retail bank, there would be a commensurate reduction to CET1 in the
event that the deal closes.
Number two, as you know, our business in Canada remains classified as held for sale, and we now expect the
transaction to complete in the first quarter of 2024, as we work with the purchaser to ensure a smooth transition.
We continue to expect to pay the potential special dividend of $0.21 per share in the first half of 2024. And as
previously indicated, we expect almost all excess capital from the Canada transaction accruing into CET1 to be
returned to shareholders primarily through a rolling series of share buybacks in 2024 and 2025 that would be
incremental to any existing buyback program at that time. Number three, share buybacks remain an active part of
our capital management plans and we will update you on our assumptions for share buybacks in 2023 and
beyond at our interim results.
So, in summary, this was a strong quarter. It was a strong profit performance. Net interest income was stable.
Strict cost discipline was maintained, which I told you, would remain a key focus area for myself and the
management team. Our credit performance was benign amid a more positive economic outlook. We are starting
to see the impact of strong economic rebounds in Hong Kong and mainland China and our wealth strategy is
gaining traction.
And I am pleased there was strong capital returns, a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share and the share buyback
of up to $2 billion, which we expect to start after the AGM and complete in around three months. As Noel said, we
are clearly on track to meet our returns target for 2023 onwards, and this upward trajectory would give us
substantial distribution capacity, including, of course, the potential proceeds from the Canada transaction.
With that, operator, can we please open it up for questions. Thank you.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Elhedery. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Joseph
Dickerson with Jefferies. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph Dickerson Q
Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.
Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. Congrats on a good set of numbers in what wasn't the easiest environment in Q1.

Noel Quinn A

Hi, Joe. [indiscernible] (00:20:43) Thank you for that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph Dickerson Q
Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.
Just a quick question on the buyback. You've been very precise in discussing that you would expect to complete
the buyback over three months. Is this something now we can expect to be a regular quarterly event given the
strong capital generation, not to mention Canada completing early next year, or is it going to be slightly more
erratic?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Joe, thank you for your question. I'll ask Georges to answer that. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Joe. Yes, indeed. So, first, we are hoping to achieve $2 billion in the next three month. In the past,
we've managed to achieve between $1 billion and $1.5 billion in a quarter. Obviously, we have five month to
complete this program. We are hoping to complete it in three months. Going forward, we're certainly considering a
rolling series of buybacks in 2023, 2024, 2025. Those will be supported by organic capital generation as well as
the Canada sale proceeds in 2024. And, Joe, it remains our intention to return excess capital, including the
Canada proceeds if the conditions justify it.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 02-May-2023
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Elhedery. Our next question today comes from Raul Sinha with JPMorgan. Your line
is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Hi, Raul.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Raul Sinha Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Good morning, gents. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Maybe just to follow up on that capital return
question firstly, and then I have got another one on asset quality. When we look at your headline capital ratio,
obviously, it's very strong and quite a significant pickup over the last couple of quarters in particular. I guess, there
are a few adjusting items in there. Should we kind of exclude the French disposal that's a reversal from the
headline ratio? And I guess if we exclude the share buyback, we kind of get back in your range towards the lower
end. So, I guess, the question is, how much RWA growth do you anticipate the business to require over the next
sort of 12 months? And linking to your loan growth outlook as well, I'm just wondering if you could give us some
color on RWA growth expectations there and that hopefully gives us a good idea of how much buybacks we can
expect.
The second one, again, related to how much capital you might be able to generate in the remaining part of the
year. Your guidance on asset quality still implies quite a significant pickup in provisions given your very strong
performance in Q1. So, I guess the question really is, are you guiding us to something specific in terms of the 40
basis point provision charge, or is that just an element of conservatism built into your guidance there? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Georges, do you want to take both of those? I can always add something to the asset quality later, but you take
both of those.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Sure, Noel, and thank you, Raul. So, on your first question, Raul, I think it is prudent to adjust for the French part
reversal of the impairment insofar that capital is concerned. As indicated, if we do reach a transaction, there is a
likelihood of a commensurate kind of capital reduction taking place. Now, just to remind you, our capital target
operating range is 14% to 14.5%. And we expect this to be reviewed slightly lower in the medium to long term.
And as we do our capital return projections or our share buyback projections, we look at our medium-term capital
outlook and compare it to that range. And this is – and, obviously, cautiously compare it to that range, and this is
what's giving us now the flexibility to announce the share buyback and to consider additional buybacks going
forward.
As regards RWA growth, in line with loan growth, it has been subdued in the first quarter. It may remain subdued
for another quarter. We may see some pickup, particularly with the Hong Kong and China bounce-back. But
again, for this year, we have not given guidance on loan growth, recognizing some of the economic conditions.
We do remain committed for medium term – or mid-single digit growth in loans for the medium term, which is what
you can factor in for RWA growth commensurately and equally for our share buyback.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 02-May-2023
If I move on to your next question with regards asset quality, I would lean towards your latter comment, Joe –
sorry, Raul, that we are baking in some conservatism or we think at this stage the full-year guidance, which we
have retained unchanged from February is now leaning towards conservative. Just want to highlight, some
tailwinds. Certainly, the situation in the UK, the possibility that we may dodge a recession is a tailwind. Equally,
the recovery in Hong Kong and mainland China following the opening up of the borders and resumption of
activities and trade is a tailwind, but at the same time – and obviously, the China real estate has shown some
positive signs, both from the economic standpoint as well from the policy measures. But at the same time, we
wanted to remain cautious. There are a number of refinancing taking place in Q3 in the China commercial real
estate portfolio, which we would like to stay cautious on. And we continue to watch some of the UK SME space, in
particular, those heavily reliant on discretionary consumer spend before we revisit the guidance. We intend to
revisit this guidance at the H1.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Just one additional comment from me, please, if I can. You'll notice on the capital schedule. I can't remember
what slide it was, but there's a capital walk on CET1. And in there, you'll see that we've accrued dividends of 50%
of the profit generation in Q1. And if you do the maths on that, the accrual on dividend is higher than the $0.10
that you've got in the Q1 declared interim dividend. So, we're accruing capital distribution at a higher rate – a
dividend distribution at a higher rate than the payment of the $0.10. So, that's just factored into our CET1 ratio as
well.
Thank you. Next question, please.

Manus, hi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manus Costello Q
Analyst, Autonomous
Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. A couple, please. On a slide, you were talking about, Noel, about
the the RWA walk, I noticed that the risk-weighted assets from Silicon Valley just short of $ 10 billion which seems
quite high relative to the loans that you have taken. I wondered if you could share with us what the nature of those
assets is and give us an indication about asset quality within the Silicon Valley Bank acquisition and what you've
seen so far.
And then secondly, with the thought to the structure of the group, you've obviously showed some willingness to
make some acquisitions recently and you did some disposals where possible. I just wondered if there will be any
interest in further moves, and particularly I'm wondering if there will be anything around some of your businesses,
such as insurance manufacturing which you might think about being noncore to the group going forward.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 02-May-2023
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you. Thanks, Manus. Just on the asset quality of SVB, everything that we've seen since we bought the
business – I don't know, I lost track of time, must be about six, seven weeks ago now, it's been a busy quarter –
everything we've seen reinforces the view that we had that we can, when we did due diligence, that the book was
a good quality book. We've seen no nasty surprises. We did do a bit of mark-to-market on acquisition accounting,
but that was – evidence was when we did due diligence that weekend.
Georges can give you a little bit more detail on that. But fundamentally, the asset quality of the SVB book is as we
expected it. The team has done a good job in building that business over the past 14 years. They've got good
client relations, a good quality book and good business development potential. And on the back of that, we
decided to invest in putting more people on the ground in some of the key markets around the world that have
strong technology and life science centers to take that business model, not just to the UK, but to take it globally.
So, we're invested in that as well. So, no nasty surprises on that.
And then in terms of other acquisitions that we may consider or M&A activity, I mean, I think the insurance
business is a key component of the wealth proposition that we have. We have a very profitable insurance
business in Hong Kong. It's a combination of manufacturing and distribution. The team has done a good job in
building out the product line-up in Hong Kong over the past few years to put us back into a market-leading
position in Hong Kong and we get access to the full value chain.
One of the challenges we've often faced in the past is getting full recognition of that value as a bank shareholder
in an asset – in an insurance manufacturing business. But you can rest assured the economics of that business
are very strong and we've got a market-leading position. So, we obviously, like all businesses, keep the strategy
under review. And if we think there's a better position to take, we'll take it. But at the moment, we're pleased with
the way the insurance business is performing.
Georges, was there anything else you wanted to add on...?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Maybe just getting some of the math, so we acquired the loan book that is just shy of £6 billion. That's about $8
billion. We've acquired $10 billion of RWA. So, if you consider those loans and some of the additional RWAs on
Treasury books, operational risk, et cetera, you kind of land on these numbers. And, Manus, we also acquired
$1.5 billion of capital after the fair value adjustments. So, you're talking about effectively a 15% CET1 ratio
business that we acquired. So, we think it is where it should be.

Omar Keenan Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd.
Good morning. Thank you very much. Hi. Thank you very much for taking the question. I just had a quick question
on rate sensitivity. And if I look at your rate sensitivity at the end of 2022, it looks like you've been quite
purposefully bringing down your rate sensitivity on the [ph] year 1 view (00:32:10). And I was hoping you can
perhaps give us a little bit of color of the direction that sensitivity over [ph] one year (00:32:26) have changed in
the first couple of months of the year. Can we assume that some of the structural hedges have been rather
increased and will we see the sensitivity at the interim might have reduced further? Any kind of color
[indiscernible] (00:32:41) would be really helpful. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Georges, do you want to answer that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Sure. Thank you, Omar. So, at the end of 2022, the rate sensitivity on the downside 100 basis point scenario was
reduced from around $6 billion at the half year to around $4 billion. That $2 billion reduction for NII sensitivity
reduction for 100 basis point is for about a third of it, justified by the structural hedges that we started putting in
place or that we continued putting in place as of last year, and two-thirds of it is due to the fact that we're at just
higher level of rates and therefore we have less negative convexity on the downside.
If you look into Q1, we have not published a revised rate sensitivity, but we continued the trajectory of our
structural hedges. Now, just as a reminder, structural hedges will reduce somewhat our rate sensitivity and our
target is to take that $4 billion in the medium term to circa $3 billion. And we are on that journey. We certainly
have not arrived there. We'll be giving you an update at H1. I think I've addressed your points, actually, Omar.

Hello. I've got two questions. The first one is, well, obviously, the [indiscernible] (00:34:24) strong, and a lot of it

Global Banking and Market. How much of that do you think is sustainable? Presumably, you wouldn't encourage
us annualize the whole lot? So, how much of that do you think is sustainable?
And secondly is, I guess, on the AGM on Friday, so I guess, a lot of the attention on Friday will be around the
debate you are having with Pan and they obviously recently published an announcement that made some
critiques, especially around your cost/income ratio and ROTE. Well, you've obviously printed very strong numbers
today, but [indiscernible] (00:35:01) already, especially around [indiscernible] (00:35:03), and I'm sure you've also
been communicating with them anyway. So, why do you think those critiques were still made?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Okay. I'll deal with the second one later, I'll ask Georges to deal with the non-NII first if that's okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Sure. So, we're expecting many of you will adjust your full year numbers to reflect our Q1 outperformance, and
that's a fair assessment, Perlie, but I'll caution you not to annualize Q1. So, if I just unpack it, the non-NII relating
to the funding of our trading activities, $1.4 billion, is fairly reasonable to assume this number will annualize. The
Wealth business – obviously, with the outlook improving in Wealth, fairly reasonable to assume we will see –
regain traction and bounce back, in particular, in Hong Kong, whereas some of the other activities such as the
foreign exchange trading outperformance, I would caution you not to annualize this number and just to bake it in
as a Q1 outcome, and then Q2, Q3, we'll see how they fare.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
So, just on the – and on the Wealth performance, so you said most of the non-NII was CMB and GBM. I think it's
also fair to say that in WPB, the Wealth business performed well in Q1, its revenue was up 13% in Q1 relative to
Q1 last year. So, I think what Georges was saying is, I think we've seen a recovery taking place in our Wealth
revenue. We're not expecting that to just be a Q1 phenomenon. That is something that we'll continue in Q2 and
Q3 and Q4. But it's still early days to predict whether the 13% is an annual number or it's higher than that or lower
than that, but we don't expect it to disappear in Q2, Q3, or Q4. So, there should be a level of annualization on that
as well in the WPB non-NII line.
With respect to the AGM comment, look, I think we've said for a while that we believe the safest and fastest way
to achieve higher returns, better performance, better dividends and capital generation was the existing strategy. I
think the Q1 results provides a lot of evidence that that is the fact; that that is the best way. We guided the market
over the last 12 months to a 12% plus RoTE. I did emphasize at the year-end that we should focus on the plus,
not the 12 and I think you see in Q1, even excluding the notable items, we've done a RoTE of 19.3%.
I would just draw your attention to the fact that in that RoTE of 19.3%, there is a tax credit and Georges could
probably cover that as well. That tax credit is not something that will repeat every quarter. But even if you adjust
for that, it's still a very healthy return on tangible equity.
So, I think it's in the – what we're focused on is driving performance on behalf of all our shareholders. And we
believe doing what we've done is the best way to get improved returns, improved performance, rather than some
more radical corporate restructuring action. So, we believe Q1 is strong evidence of that. But Georges, you'd just
want to clarify the tax situation.

Georges Elhedery A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
So, we've basically shown $1.9 billion as a tax charge, which is an effective tax rate of 14%. But I just want to
caution you that 3.2% relate to the provisional gain on SVB, which is a nontaxable item, and another 3.3% relate
to the release of provisions for uncertain tax provisions, which is also a one-off item. So therefore, if you adjusted
for those two, we still expect a 20% ETR guidance for the rest of the year.

Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Andrew Coombs with Citi. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Coombs Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
Good morning. One strategic question and then one numbers question. On the strategic question, if the proposed
French retail sale no longer goes ahead, what would be the plan? Would you get back on the block again or
would there be a plan to reabsorb it into the broader HSBC Group? Is there anything you can say on plans for
France given that sale process and where we've got to?
Secondly, on cost. You've actually had a very good cost trend this quarter. You're down 2% year-on-year on a
constant currency basis and yet you're still guiding to 3% cost growth or 4% with SVB UK. So, is this a timing
issue? Is it a case of the wage inflation coming through from Q2? Anything you can elaborate there? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Two good questions. And Georges will cover the second one. I'll cover the first one. I think listen, we still believe
that the sale of the French retail business is the right strategic outcome. That business probably has a stronger
future in another purchaser's hands. However, we have been in discussions for a few weeks now with the current
buyer to try and overcome the challenge they have on their acquisition accounting impact on their capital base.
We'll continue that dialogue. We're hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable settlement with them on that, but
we can't be guaranteed of that outcome. We have to consider what is financially the right decision for all
shareholders and it's hopeful that we can reach an agreement, but it's not guaranteed. In the event we can't, then
I still think we'll continue to run the business, but I still think over time, we wouldn't see that as a long-term
strategic hold, but we'll have to wait and see what happens thereafter.
We're very much focused on trying to reach an agreement with the current buyer to bring that transaction to a
close. So that's the update I have for you. On cost, I'll hand over to Georges.

Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Noel, and thank you, Andrew, for the question. So our reported costs on a constant currency basis is
down 2% Q1 last year to Q1 this year. If you adjust for notables – and remember, last year Q1, we had $450
million of additional cost due to the CTA program. So if you extract that notable item from last year's base, our
reported cost, adjusted for notables, will show as up 2% Q1 to Q1. This is the basis on which we are measuring
ourselves for this year and it's on that basis where we are targeting to achieve a 3% annualized number where
our quarter one basically is coming in at 2%.
Now, why from 2% to 3%? Just want to highlight a few things. The first one is we still haven't incurred by and
large the severance costs which we announced at the year end and now we expect to incur the majority of it in Q2
this year. And the second element just to highlight is that some of the pay increases have only been factored
partially in Q1 starting March and will start kind of being fully factored in from Q2 onwards. And this is why our 3%
target for the full year is where it is.
And as you said, Andrew, and just for avoidance of any doubt here, the acquired cost of SVB and some of the
additional investments we need to do there will add another 1% to that 3% target.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
So, just a couple of additional comments for me. On that reconciliation between the headline reporting number
and the cost target, what we're trying to do is be very straightforward and not try and bake in what was a CTA last
year into the cost base of this year. So, we're adjusting down the prior year reported number for the notable CTA
last year so that the cost target of 3% is on an apples-and-apples basis with the cost base of this year. So, we're
not looking to take an easy option on that. We think it's the right thing to do. But as we say, we're 2% against the
3% target in Q1.
And then on SVB, I just want to clarify as well. The SVB business we bought, we acquired a cost base with that
and we acquired a revenue stream and that revenue stream was in excess of the cost base. So we've acquired a
positive P&L that was contributing, if I remember correctly, around about $80 million to $90 million of PBT. So
although we've acquired $300 million – sorry, we've acquired – the majority of the $300 million is the acquired
cost base of SVB, it is a profitable cost base.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
And Andy, just to finish off, we've provided the reconciliation on slide 30 to show you the work from reported cost
to our cost target and we will be showing this slide every quarter.

Georges Elhedery A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Hi, Guy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Guy Stebbings Q
Analyst, Exane BNP Paribas
Hi. Morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. One on net interest margin and one back on SVB. So on
NIM, back on SVBs. So, on NIM, I guess, the UK ring-fenced bank did quite a lot of heavy lifting this quarter,
allowing for 1 basis point sequential NIM growth. As we look ahead, perhaps that tailwind space, at least in
quantum, so is that going to make it tricky from here to deliver NIM sustainability or is the drop in [indiscernible]
(00:45:34) headwind and deposit mix in particular likely to fade in your view to allow for some sort of stable NIM
backdrop?
And then the same question on SVB. In addition to the acquired cost base, you flagged in incremental investment
spend and plans to build the business outside the UK. So could you talk about sort of associated revenue
ambitions and what sort of timeframe you expect to see any noticeable uplift there? I mean, sort of how big a shift
in that $80 million to $90 million PBT you referenced could we see of SVB [indiscernible] (00:46:04) HSBC with
that incremental investment? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Okay. Thank you. I'll take the second in a moment. I'll ask Georges to cover the NIM, please, and UK ring-fenced
bank.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Sure. Thanks, Noel. Thanks, Guy. So, indeed, you did call out the headwinds, the possibility of headwinds in the
UK. Obviously, there may be still one or two rate hikes for which we will be passing most of that to customers
through pass-through rates. And we do see continued headwinds in Hong Kong with around 1% per month
migration into term deposit, with the mix now at 25% term deposits across both our entities in Hong Kong.
This being said, we also have tailwinds. The first one is we still have a strong momentum from Q1, which we're
carrying over. The second tailwind is HIBOR normalization. I mean, just for reference, in Hong Kong, HIBOR and
Exchange Fund Bills rates in Q1 were 65 basis point and 35 basis point lower on average than where they were
in Q4 and that was a major headwind for us in Q1.
We are seeing now, over the last few weeks, we have been seeing normalization in those rates. If we continue to
see normalization and just for the reminder, we're about 200 basis points off their equivalent rate in dollars. If we
continue to see normalization, this will provide us material tailwinds in the Hong Kong base.
And the other tailwind is our resilient deposit and loan base. We continue having stable deposits and loans
despite some of the competitive pressures. And we continue to aim for mid-single-digit growth in both in the
medium term, which should give us some supportive tailwinds.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 02-May-2023
So just to reinforce what we said at the full year results in February, we said – we noted the guidance that was in
existence when we reported in February. And we said we were not uncomfortable – sorry, with the consensus
that we noted the consensus that was in existence in February and we said we were not uncomfortable with
where consensus was.
We still have that view. The only adjustment you need to make to NII is for the IFRS 17 adjustment. Everything
else remains, as we said in February, that the guidance that existed at that point in time, we were not
uncomfortable with it. The same is true today. Just adjust for IFRS 17, which is around about a $2 billion
adjustment from IFRS 4 to IFRS 17. That's the only change that needs to be made based on what we've given
you as an update today.
And then on SVB, we acquired, sorry, we recruited over 40 people in the US to build out our SVB capability in the
US. We did not bring a book with them, purchase a book. So, they will be in build-out mode. So, there will be a
payback period on that investment. We think it's a relatively short payback period based on the quality of people
we've hired. We're looking at other geographies around the world. We think it's a sensible and modest investment
to do that organically and we're pretty confident on the payback. We'll be relatively sure. We'll provide more
details once we complete our build-out. Hopefully by the half year, we'll be able to give you more information.
So, there will be a profit drag to a degree probably in the first year, 18 months, but then I think it will be back into
profit territory even on those organic build-out strategies, but we'll give more of an update at the half year. I think
strategically, it's absolutely the right thing to do for the medium term. This is a sector of the economy that is critical
for all geographies and has huge growth potential on revenue. Thank you. Next question, please.

Hi, Rob.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Noble Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank AG (UK)
Hi there. Most of my questions have been asked. If you just flip out the LCR, it's relatively low in a European
context, obviously your deposit base is a different kind of structure. So are you happy ramping with that level in
the medium term with the uncertainty in the market and how do you expect regulation or approach to liquidity to
change given what's happened in the US? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Georges, do you want to handle that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Sure. Thank you, Rob. So, we don't target LCR. We are continuing to target medium term, single- to mid-digit loan
growth in our portfolio, and we obviously continue to cherish deposits and attract and continue wanting to attract
deposits. The LCR would be an outcome. I think insofar that we look at our liquidity management, it's the high-
quality liquid assets ratio that we look at. It's the cash and cash equivalent within it that we look at. And in terms of
loans, again, if the short term is somewhat subdued, in particular, in Hong Kong, in the medium term, some of the

bounce back and some of the trade bounce back that we're seeing as well may support that loan growth ambition
in the medium term.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
And I think on the regulation impacts, I think we have to wait and see what the various regulators around the
world do on regulation. But I think the way I look at it, the primary responsibility for running a prudent balance
sheet is on the management and the board of a financial institution. That's a responsibility we've taken seriously
throughout our history. Our high quality liquid assets has been a feature of our heritage. Our high-quality cash and
cash equivalents has been a feature of our heritage for many decades. So, we put the primary responsibility on
liquidity management on ourselves and then we'll see what the regulatory environment does as a consequence of
some of the recent changes. But thank you. Next question.

Operator: Next question is from Aman Rakkar with Barclays. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Aman, hi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aman Rakkar Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
Good morning, Noel. Hey. Good morning, Noel. Good morning, Georges. I just need to come back to revenues.
Both your net interest income and your non-interest income are performing really well in Q1. And they are
annualizing at levels that would suggest pretty material upside to market expectations for both of those lines. Your
net interest income is annualizing north of $36 billion on the Q1 number. You've guided obviously greater than
$34 billion. I appreciate there's lots of moving parts there. But, I guess, to be more specific, Noel, in terms of your
commentary around consensus of full year now, there's a kind of $1.7 billion gap between where the Street is and
what you're guiding for, Street's with $35.7 billion. It doesn't actually sound like you see much downside to that
consensus number at $35.7 billion.
Unless there's something here around term deposit mix or it feels like there's a lot of conservatism in the NII
guidance, or there's something I'm missing. So can you help us with that? And then secondly, on the noninterest
income, I totally appreciate your markets business might have overrun in Q1, but you are also pointing towards
the wealth management business that's trending higher, an underlying momentum in your fee business as you
talked about strategic initiatives at full year that sit behind that.
So, like to what extent is that revenue number an overrun or is this the kind of level that we can expect you to
crank out in the year because this is well ahead of where the Street is. Any color you can give us there would be
really helpful. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Aman, two good questions. And let me just clarify what I said about – what we said in February. I think you're right
on your math. So, I think if you go back to what we said in February, that was we talked about $36-billion-plus.
And when people were talking about our NII that was sort of annualized and it's for about $38 billion and the
consensus was around $37 billion to $37.5 billion.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 02-May-2023
And I think we said we were comfortable with that. So, I think if you go back to then, we sort of said yes, we're sort
of comfortable, consensus had a calculation on the plus bit of the $36 billion, that put it sort of north of $37 billion.
That was around about consensus back then. And all I'm saying to you now is the only thing you need to adjust
for is IFRS 17, which takes about $2 billion off of that. So, we're talking about $34-billion-plus, and that therefore
would put you north of $35 billion.
So, I think what we're saying is that should – we're sort of saying the Street has probably got NII around about the
right place back in February of last year and we're saying there's no need to change what the Street is. You only
got to do the mechanical adjustment for IFRS 17. Hopefully that helps.
And then, Georges, I think do you want to just come back on the non-NII, because I think you're right, there's
elements of our non-NII performance in Q1 that Georges is saying annualized. There's just some elements that
are saying it may be unwise to analyze them fully for some of the trading income. But, Georges, do you just want
to reclarify what you said?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Sure, Noel. So, Aman, if I kind of unpack the non-NII, some of the outperformance that we've seen with regards
funding of the trading book where we've seen $1.4 billion this quarter against $0.1 billion quarter one last year
because rates were at zero, but against $1.3 billion quarter four, so somewhat flat to just slightly up from quarter
four.
That number is – it is fair to annualize it given current rate forecast consensus. Equally, as Noel mentioned
earlier, the discussion on wealth, the growth in NNIA, in wealth, the resumption of activity in Hong Kong in
particular bodes well for the future and I think it is fair to assume that we will see continued performance in wealth.
On the other hand, some of the outperformance in some of the markets activities, such as foreign exchange
trading, which had a record quarter, may not be repeated. And obviously, we will have to look at it quarter-by-
quarter in terms of what business opportunities are there. And what you can bake in and factor in the results, the
Q1 outperformance, I would caution you not to annualize that outperformance.
But in general, Aman, if I take a step back, it is a good set of results and we are confident about the future. And in
light of the strong Q1 performance, we will have to review and we will review the guidance in H1.

Martin Leitgeb Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs International
I just have one broader question on growth and one follow-up on deposits, please. And I'm just looking at a much
improved profitability levels of the group, with [indiscernible] (00:58:20) being around $2 billion to $3 billion higher
of the quarter despite capacity to scale up growth. And I was just wondering, if we look into the medium term or
starting 2024, do you see the [ph] goal (00:58:33) for the group to lean more into growth [indiscernible] (00:58:39)
single digits loan growth could potentially be higher? Or should we just think that any increase in profitability could
be potentially returned to shareholders just in terms of the trade-off between opportunity for growing more versus
shareholder return?
And secondly, with regards to the deposit franchise, I was just wondering if you could comment on the strength of
HSBC deposit franchise during the quarter. Have you seen, in particular, inflows in certain parts of your footprint
helping delivering that stable deposit [ph] strength (00:59:15) in the quarter and I was also wondering with regard
to deposit migration [indiscernible] (00:59:21) whether you have seen there any change in trend if, are we towards
the end of that cycle in terms of deposit migration or could it still go on for a number of quarters? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Okay. Just a couple of comments. One comment from me on growth. Listen, I think clearly we want to pursue
growth, but I think we have the capacity in our dividend payout ratio of 50% to pursue growth and with the option
of doing buybacks as well. Now, at the moment, I think we've seen a relatively subdued lending market in
Corporate Banking. I think the demand for term loans around the world is not particularly high at the moment and
probably isn't going to be particularly high in the very near term.
As Georges said earlier, I mean, once we get to 2024, one would expect there to be an increase in demand
starting to emerge. But for the near term for the next few months in 2023, given the economic uncertainty, we're
seeing subdued loan demand. So, I mean, the message I'd give you, in a 50% payout ratio world, we believe the
second 50% after we pay the dividends, there is potential to fund both growth and buybacks and that's our plans
going forward. Georges, do you want to just cover the deposit trend, the inflows, the outflows, and deposit
migration?

Sure, Martin. So, yeah, I mean, if I start with some of the outflows that we're seeing and then I go into the tailwind,
some of the outflows we're seeing particularly in the UK, so obviously UK retail, Q1 is a tax payment period so
there's seasonality here. We are still seeing high cost of living resilient inflation in the UK, which is obviously
draining some of the UK consumers' savings, to a lesser extent, competitive pressure as well in the UK.
Likewise, for corporates in the UK, Q4 was a year-end where people showed up their liquidity whereas Q1 most
of the companies pay dividend. And then you can see some of the draining liquidity. We're also seeing
deleveraging of loans using some of the deposits to deleverage on the loan side especially for those with a strong
rate differential between what they're paying on their loans.
This being said, we continue to see growth and strength in the deposit proposition. So, if I take Hong Kong and all
of Asia actually, we're seeing definite deposit growth in the retail and the personal banking space. We have seen
5% growth of our deposit base in commercial banking in the US. So, we were one of the beneficiary banks of the
deposit migration from medium-sized banks into large banks and we obviously continue to cherish our
propositions in deposits to continue attracting deposits at the right price.

Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Okay. Thank you, Martin. Next question, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. We will take our last question today from Tom Rayner with Numis. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Hi, Tom.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tom Rayner Q
Analyst, Numis Securities Ltd.
Yes. Thank you. Hi there. Good morning, guys. Two, please. First one, Noel, just on the loan growth. I mean, you
flagged the corporate demand and maybe that is the answer. I just kind of ask, could you quite update on the
economic recovery you're seeing now in Hong Kong and China or in the UK, I think you said, those quite resilient.
So is there any other reason why you're sort of cautious in the short term on loan growth or is it purely a lack of
demand from some corporates? And, well, a second question on cost please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Okay. What's your question on costs Georges, do you want to – yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tom Rayner Q
Analyst, Numis Securities Ltd.
Yeah. I mean, really, it's the sort of looking at the 3% target for this year and thinking forward to next year
because, I guess, you're still enjoying some of the flow through this year from cost savings, from the previous cost
program, which has now ended. So I just wondered if, Georges, would comment on sort of approach towards
costs in 2024, whether you'll be thinking in terms of an absolute growth maybe similar to this year or whether a
jaws approach might be more appropriate? I don't know if there's anything – any color you could add for next
year? Thank you.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 02-May-2023
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Tom. Just on loan growth, listen, I think your points are fair. One, I think, if there is a place
where I think loan growth could pick up more in the near term, I think it would be Asia. I think Middle East is
another option. So I think I am being a bit cautious on the near-term loan growth. I think probably, it will start to
emerge more in the working capital side of the balance sheet, trade, finance before people start investing in fixed
capital.
But I think, there is a level of nervousness out there in the corporate world about, taking long-term investment
decisions in fixed capital. That is aside from sustainability, I think, there's a lot of infrastructure spend taking place
and I could see some loan growth coming in and around that sustainable infrastructure investment.
So, maybe, I am being a bit cautious on loan growth at the moment. I think I'd rather be that way in the near term,
but I don't think – I do believe this is going to be medium-term loan growth. I think it's fair to say that Asia has the
potential to pick up faster than elsewhere in the world. So, yeah, I think it may be fair that I'm being a bit cautious.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
If I kind of just adding to Noel's comments, Tom. If you look at Hong Kong in the retail space, both cards and
mortgages have been growing in the first quarter. Even in the UK, we are seeing green shoots in the mortgage
sector. I mean our market share in the mortgage sector in the UK for the first two month of the year is at 15%.
That's for new business. That's against the book market share of about 7.5% and the Q4 new business market
share of 9%.
So, we're certainly there in the retail space where we're seeing growth. On the wholesale side, I just want to add
one comment to Noel's description, which is also bear in mind the rate differential between China and Hong Kong.
So, all those Chinese companies who used to use Hong Kong as a base for raising funding internationally will be
less doing so as long as the rate differential between dollar rates and onshore China rates, are that wide. It is
cheaper for these corporates to raise funding in mainland China as opposed to Hong Kong and that will remain
the case up until the time we see a reversal in that rate trend.
If I move to your second question, Tom. We have not shared targets for 2024 as yet, but the few guiding
principles I can share with you, the first guiding principle, paramount guiding principle, is that you should expect
our focus on cost discipline to continue. The second guiding principle is that, we will continue doing transformation
and restructuring as part of our BAU cost base and expect some of those saves to flow through also into 2024
and beyond. And case in point is the spend on severance, which we're planning now to do in Q2 this year for
which the benefit will flow through mostly into 2024. And thirdly, at this stage, we're still looking to guide towards
dollar cost number as opposed to jaws in the way we will be looking at 2024 as we come to be able to give you
additional guidance later in the year.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 02-May-2023
So, thank you, all, for your questions. Really appreciate you taking the time. To close our first quarter results, I
just want to say that the first quarter results provide further evidence that our strategy is working. We had a strong
first quarter profit performance. Cost discipline remained tight, and we're clearly on track to deliver our ROCE
target. We've resumed quarterly dividends and announced a share buyback of up to $2 billion. But I'm also
confident about the rest of 2023. We built a strong platform for future growth, and our geographical footprint puts
us in areas of high growth. I look forward to speaking with you soon. Have a good morning or afternoon. Thank
you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes the call for HSBC Holdings Plc Q1 2023 results.
You may now disconnect.
