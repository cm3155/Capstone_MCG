Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the East West Bancorp's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings
Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation,
there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Adrienne Atkinson, Director of Investor Relations. Please go
ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Adrienne Atkinson
Director of Investor Relations, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you, everyone, for joining us to review East West Bancorp's third
quarter 2023 financial results. With me are Dominic Ng, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Christopher Del
Moral-Niles , our new Chief Financial Officer; and Irene Oh, Chief Risk Officer. This call is being recorded and will
be available for replay on our Investor Relations website. The slide deck referenced during this call is available on
our Investor Relations site.
Management may make projections or other forward-looking statements, which may differ materially from actual
results due to a number of risks and uncertainties. Management may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. For
a more detailed description of the risk factors and the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures,
please refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Form 8-K filed today.
I will now turn the call over to Dominic.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Adrienne. Good morning, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our earnings call. Before we
start, I would like to welcome Adrienne and Chris. I would also like to congratulate Irene on assuming the role of
Chief Risk Officer and thank her for her service as CFO and help in ensuring a smooth transition. Their leadership
will be integral in advancing the company's growth strategy and risk capabilities.
I will now begin the review of our financial results on slide 3 of our presentation. This morning, we reported strong
results. Third quarter 2023 net income was $288 million and diluted earnings per share was $2.02, driven by a
record level of quarterly revenue and net interest income.
Our continued customer focus and diversified growth strategy allowed East West to grow loans from the prior
quarter and add significant customer deposits. We kept expenses well-controlled, generated quarterly positive
operating leverage and grew tangible book value. We also maintained broadly stable asset quality and continued
to proactively manage our credit risk.
Slide 4 presents a summary of our balance sheet position that is strong, well-diversified, and efficient. You can
see that we grew customer deposits by $1 billion from the prior period, with notable growth in both our consumer
and commercial balances. These customer deposits largely funded this quarter's loan growth, allowing us to use
excess cash to pay down maturing wholesale deposits. We're also pleased with the mix of our loan growth, where
nearly half the growth came from low risk residential mortgages.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
In the third quarter, we generated industry leading returns on our capital. We continue to maintain strong capital
ratios, which are now the highest for regional banks. East West is on track for another year of record earnings in
2023 and we are looking forward to starting 2024 from a position of strength given our earnings stability, solid
credit performance, and strong capital levels, our board of directors has approved the resumption of our share
repurchase program in the fourth quarter.
I will now turn the call over to Irene for a more detailed discussion of our portfolio and asset quality. Irene?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Dominic, and good morning to all on the call. I'll start with a discussion of our loan portfolio. Slide 5
provides detail on our overall loan book. East West loans are largely balanced by type across residential
mortgage, commercial real estate, and C&I. Within C&I, our exposures are also well-diversified by industry. Our
Greater China exposures remain limited at roughly 4% of total loans, and nearly all our C&I loans also well-
diversified by industry.
Slide 6 shows the details of our commercial real estate portfolio. It is important to note that East West portfolio
remains well-diversified by geography and property type. When comparing our portfolio to the FFIEC commercial
real estate concentration guidelines, we have consistently been below the guideline since the end of 2009.
Slide 7 provides additional detail on commercial real estate. As you see, the portfolio is very granular with an
average loan size of $3 million. The weighted average loan-to-value for the portfolio was a low 51%. Fewer than
25% of our commercial real estate loans have a loan-to-value of 60% or over. In the appendix, we have shared
similar trends of low average loan sizes and LTVs within our office and retail commercial real estate portfolio.
Many of our commercial real estate borrowers have had longstanding relationships with our banks and a large
portion of our loans are full recourse with personal guarantees. As a reminder, we typically originate amortizing
loans with a maturity of 7 to 10 years. We also have low risk from near-term maturities. Out of quarter end, only
8% of the income producing commercial real estate portfolio matures in the fourth quarter of 2023 and for all of
2024.
On slide 8, we provide detail on our residential mortgage portfolio, which is made up largely of single-family
mortgages and also home equity lines of credit. Like commercial real estate, our residential mortgage portfolio is
well-diversified by geography and property. The average loan-to-value for our residential mortgage portfolio is
also quite low at 51%, with close to 90% of our portfolio below a 60% LTV.
As you can see on the slide in our distribution by geography, our residential mortgage loans are overwhelmingly
in footprint, with the primary source of originations coming through our branch network. Residential mortgage has
proven to be a resilient source of loan growth for us, growing 3% from the second quarter. I would also like to
highlight that over 80% of our HELOC commitment, we are in first lien position.
Turning to slide 9. The asset quality of our portfolio remained broadly stable. During the third quarter, we recorded
net charge-offs of $18 million or 14 basis points, an increase from net charge-offs of 6 basis points in the second
quarter. Quarter-over-quarter, non-performing assets as of September 30th, decreased modestly to $104 million
or 15 basis points of total assets from 17 basis points as of June 30th.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
The criticized loan ratio increased 38 basis points from June 30th to 2.01% of loans held for investment. The
special mention loans ratio increased 29 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 95% (sic) [0.95%] of loans held for
investment as of September 30th and the classified loans ratio increased 9 basis points to 1.06% as credit
continued to normalize. The increases were driven primarily by C&I, as some borrowers are being impacted by
higher rates and inflation.
There were no industry or sector trends for this increase in criticized C&I loans and also no geographic trends to
highlight and the slight uptick in commercial real estate criticized loans. We remain vigilant and proactive in
monitoring and managing our credit risk. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $42 million in the third
quarter, compared with $26 million for the second quarter, building the allowance for loan losses ratio 1 basis
point to 1.29%.
Turning to slide 10. As shown on this slide, all of our capital ratios expanded quarter-over-quarter due to the
strength of our earnings. If adjustments were made for AFS and HTM security marks and the allowance for loan
losses, that is not already reflected in equity, our capital ratios would still be very strong. Tangible common equity
grew to 9.03% as of September 30th. Quarter-over-quarter, our tangible book value per share increased 2%.
Year-over-year, tangible book value per share increased 18%.
East West Board of Directors has declared fourth quarter 2023 dividend for the company's common stock. The
quarterly common stock dividend of $0.48 per share will be payable on November 15, 2023 to stockholders of
record on November 1, 2023. We currently have $254 million of repurchase authorization that remains available
for future buybacks. Although we did not repurchase any shares during the third quarter of 2023 as announced in
our earnings release, we intend to resume repurchases in the fourth quarter.
I'll now turn the call over to Chris for a more detailed discussion of the drivers of our income statement and
outlook. Chris?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Irene, and good morning to all. I will start with a discussion of our deposit strength and then review the
key drivers of net interest income and net interest margin.
Slide 11 highlights our deposit mix by segment, customer type, and source. In the third quarter, we grew both
commercial and consumer deposit balances, increased the number of customer accounts, and reduced higher
cost wholesale deposits. Year-over-year, we have successfully grown deposits across our client sectors. Our
commercial deposits remain well-diversified by industry and our consumer deposits are fairly granular.
Turning to the balance sheet on slide 12. Third quarter average loans grew 2% sequentially, driven by growth in
all major categories. Third quarter average deposits of $55.2 billion increased $900 million or 2% from the second
quarter. During the third quarter, growth in average money market and time deposits was offset by declines in
other deposit categories, largely reflecting customers optimizing their yields in a higher interest rate environment.
Our average loan-to-deposit ratio was 90% during the third quarter and average non-interest-bearing demand
deposits made up 30% of average deposits for the period.
Turning to the NIM on slide 13. Third quarter 2023 net interest income was $571 million, a new third quarter
record for East West. Net interest margin was 3.48%, which compressed by 7 basis points quarter-over-quarter.
As you can see from the waterfall chart on this slide, NIM compression was largely due to the impact of higher

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
interest-bearing deposit costs and the deposit mix shift to higher cost customer deposit categories, partially offset
by the lower wholesale deposits and higher loan volumes.
Turning to slide 14. The third quarter average loan yield increased by 18 basis points quarter-over-quarter and the
spot coupon rate on our loans was 6.62% at quarter end, compared with 6.45% at June 30th. In total, nearly 60%
of our loan portfolio was variable rate at September 30th, with a fairly balanced split between prime rate and
SOFR-linked loans.
Over the last several years, while rates were low, we continue to help many of our CRE and also some C&I
customers hedge against the rising rate risk through the use of swaps, caps, and collars. As a result, on the
customer side, nearly two-thirds of the total CRE book was fixed rate to them at September 30th. These clients
are partially protected against the rising debt service costs and the payment shocks from the higher rate
environment over the near-term.
Turning to slide 15. Our average cost of deposits for the third quarter was 243 basis points, up 31 basis points
from the second quarter. Our spot rate on total deposits was 248 basis points as of September 30th, reflecting a
46% cumulative beta relative to the change in Fed funds since December 2021. In comparison, the cumulative
beta on our loans has been 61% over the same period. We were pleased with our ability to manage deposit costs
during the quarter. We paid down $1.6 billion of higher cost wholesale deposits and replaced much of that with
lower cost customer funds.
Moving on to non-interest income on slide 16. Total non-interest income in the quarter was $77 million. For the
third quarter, interest rate contracts and other derivative income of $11 million increased $4 million from the
second quarter, primarily reflecting changes in market valuations. Other investment income of $2 million was
down a bit quarter-over-quarter, reflecting higher valuation marks on CRE investments recognized during the
second quarter. Our fee income for the period was $67 million.
Moving on to slide 17. Third quarter non-interest expense was $252 million, a 4% decrease quarter-over-quarter.
Excluding amortization of tax credits and CDI, adjusted non-interest expense was $202 million in the third quarter,
down over $3 million or down 2% sequentially. This was driven by decreases in several categories, including
lower consulting costs, lower loan related expense, lower comp and benefits expense, and lower occupancy
expense. The third quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was 31.2%, compared with 31.8% in the prior quarter. We are
pleased with our ability to consistently deliver industry leading efficiencies.
And with that, I'll now review our updated outlook for the full year on slide 18. For the full year, we are reaffirming
our prior guidance for the end of period loans, net interest income, adjusted non-interest expense, and credit
items. Regarding tax items, we now expect our effective tax rate for the full year will be between 19% to 20%,
based on about $185 million of tax credit investments. We currently anticipate that for the fourth quarter, the
amortization of tax credit investments will be approximately $45 million.
With that, I'll now turn the call back to Dominic for his closing remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Chris. In closing, we are looking forward to finishing 2023 on a high note. Our revenue, net interest
income, and profitability measures remain high. The East West business model is resilient and diversified and our
balance sheet has positioned us well to continue to focus on our customers. I want to thank our associates for all
of their hard work last quarter, which was reflected in our strong performance.

I will now open the call to questions. Operator?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer-session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes
from Casey Haire with [audio gap] (00:18:37)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah, yeah. Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and welcome back, Chris. Yeah. First question for you, Chris, just
on the NII, the – curious about the cash position and working down those wholesale deposits. Going forward, how
much more can you lean into the cash position to retire the rest of wholesale deposits?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Sure. As Irene mentioned on the last call, it was our intention to pay down up to $1.75 billion by year end and
we've obviously chopped a lot of that wood here in the third quarter with $1.6 billion paid off. So there's a little bit
that we had planned that's maturing that we're going to take care of as we go forward and then we'll continue to
evaluate the optimal level of cash as we move into next year's planning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got it. Okay. And just as my follow-up on the buyback resumption, just curious how aggressive you might be with
that. I know you have the $250 million authorization but are you looking to manage to a specific CET1 ratio or
payout ratio? Just trying to get a sense of how aggressive you might be on the buyback with the stock at
obviously attractive valuation.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I don't know I will use the word aggressive. I think we're always opportunistic. We have $254 million left to go
that's already been authorized. And so I think obviously price is pretty good and so we'll proceed. And so I will
leave it at that.

Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Brandon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
So I wanted to get more context in regards to net interest margin trends, potentially being in the higher for longer
rate environment. When do you think we could see some stabilization or potential bottoming?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, I think we expect generally continued modest compression, given the current rate outlook and given our
expectation that there's potentially another Fed action towards year end. In the medium-term, of course, we're
managing more towards dollar NII. And in the long term, obviously, our largest risk is actually to rapidly declining
rates, so we're taking proactive measures to make sure we're positioned for the long term.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And being that next year is going to be more challenging from a revenue standpoint, what are you thinking
about in terms of managing or maintaining positive operating leverage in regard to expense base?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I think it's a little early for us to give you 2024 guidance. We typically do that at the January call and we'll be happy
to follow-up then.

Operator: Our next question comes from Broderick Preston with UBS. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Broderick Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I'm actually using my full name. I like it. I wanted to ask maybe a more pointed question on the buyback, Dominic.
So you got $254 million of authorization, capital is obviously robust, the stock is cheap and well below where you
bought it back in the past and you had $220 million left over after paying the dividend out of net income in 3Q
alone. So, would you consider using the full amount in the fourth quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
So as I said earlier, we are – well, we are opportunistic and so we don't really have any specific sort of like a
direction that we have to be doing it in one quarter or not, and we'll see how – what the price is and how things
go. And one thing you can be rest assured, East West Bank is always shareholders friendly and we always do the
right thing at the right time. And whatever that makes sense that we'll go according to what we think is the best.

Got it. Okay. And then I did have a follow-up as a multi-part kind of question. Wanted to ask how much of the
bank's loan portfolio was [ph] SNCs (00:23:21)? And of that, what amount is the bank the lead underwriter on?
And then also, I don't know if Chris or Irene would have this. Do you happen to have what the reserve on the
office portfolio is?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, Brody. So as of 9/30, we held $2.4 billion of [ph] SNCs (00:23:42) that we have purchased from others. As
of 9/30, we're also the lead on $900 million of [ph] SNCs (00:23:49) indication, $300 million of which we
participated out to others. And I think your next question, although you squeezed some three questions, Brody, I
want to comment on that.
On office, so we increased the reserve for office. Total reserve for office was $230 million as of 9/30, up from
$190 million as of 6/30; and I'll just share that half of that continues to be qualitative factors versus quantitative
reserves that we need, as we look at the portfolio and the economic outlook and the portfolio credit quality. So we
continue to monitor this and make sure that our reserve is building as we think is appropriate, given the
environment.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I guess maybe, Dominic, for you. So as we think about, you have a lot of excess capital, a lot of banking peers
are pulling back. Just give us a sense of customer demand as we think about lending on the commercial side and
how you're approaching. Are you pulling back in certain areas? Just give us a sense of the growth opportunity, be
it market share driven or just customer demand driven that you're seeing today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, our priority has been mainly focusing on taking good care of our customers. As you can see, actually back in
March, some of our other former competitors were really hurting their customer in a big way. So, one of the things
that East West offer is stability and consistency. So we have, frankly, some really good commercial real estate
clients year in and year out, have been banking with us for decades, that went through cycles of various economic
conditions and actually have done really well.
In fact, whenever there is a down cycle, they tend to do better. And when there are customers like that, that find
really great opportunities, we step up and take good care of them and make sure they get the financing needs.
But we're not out there chasing down every other customers who are [ph] fleeing (00:26:20) other banks and

things like that. So obviously, as we all know, interest rate is a relatively high level and there are not that many
great deals out there. And also on the C&I side, many of our very strong customers are not out there making
substantial investments.
So in the standpoint of where are we today is that we got plenty of capital to be deployed. We are able to continue
to take very good care of our customers for their needs. But on the other hand, our customers are not out there
making very aggressive purchases or acquisitions that require a whole lot of additional line increase and so forth.
So with that, I think that, well, I would say that the growth is relatively somewhat stable and I don't expect
something dramatic just because of the market disruption that happened back in March.
But secondly, I do feel that we are getting more inquiries from customers from other banks, from banks that [ph]
failed (00:27:30) or banks that currently are not doing well. Their customers are making [indiscernible] (00:27:36).
We are prudently taking these new customers one at a time. We don't want to just quickly and then start bringing
too many on and then just causing indigestion for ourselves. So we are just prudently taking them on one at a
time, and then we feel that in the next few years in general, the market is somewhat more favorable to East West,
simply because of the current competitive landscape.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That is good color. Thanks, Dominic. And maybe just one, maybe Chris for you. And apologies if I missed it, but
the special mention loans, we saw that tick up 95 bps was 66 bps. What's driving that? Is it just your own internal
portfolio review or are there certain areas within the commercial book where you're seeing some softness?

I'll let our Chief Risk Officer address that one.

Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Chris. So, Ebrahim, when we look at that, honestly, there really aren't any drivers one way or another
or sector. It is really pretty broad-based as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. We continue to monitor the
portfolio very carefully and as appropriate given kind of where rates are, we do expect that. There will be some
kind of increases in the classified and the criticized asset ratios given the very, very low basis [ph] those are at I
might add (00:29:06).

I know you mentioned it's a little early on the expense front for next year. But just bigger picture, is there anything
we need to watch out for, any big ticket items, either on the regulatory side or systems upgrades or anything like
that, that would potentially keep that expense growth rate elevated next year?

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Okay. Great. And then as a follow-up on the margin. First, it sounded like you mentioned maybe seeing a little bit
of NIM pressure near-term, correct me if I'm wrong. But you guys also highlighted a pretty big deceleration and
the increase in deposit costs with the spot barely up from the quarter average. So just wondering, absent any Fed
rate changes, could you actually see NIM stabilize near-term and still continue to benefit from earning assets
repricing higher? And are you seeing that potentially drive the NIM stabilization and growth into 2024?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
As I look to the fourth quarter, I certainly see the mix, should we be able to continue the deposit growth from our
customer that we're seeing as providing some lift to that compression risk. That having been said, if there's
another Fed hike, there'll probably be some repricing of existing deposits that'll work against us. So those are the
dynamics that are at play, but I think you've captured the [ph] spirit of remarks well (00:30:59).

David Rochester Q

Great. Thanks, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Maybe I'll just add, I mean, if you look at the third quarter and the trajectory of the NIM and this helps kind of
inform our thoughts around this. So NIM for July was 3.45%. And then for August and September, we've got a
little bit of better 3.50% for both quarters – so months, excuse me. So that helps us kind of frame where we're at
and why we're comfortable with the stabilization as we move forward.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I wanted to ask about just a little bit more color on the funding side. It looks like you're getting some nice loan
growth and it sounds like you're going to continue to lean in here. Yeah, I think you noted that [ph] marketed
(00:31:59) deposit growth this quarter is coming from money market and time deposits. Is that where you're going
to be focused on, bringing in new funding to fund the loans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I think we're going to be looking across the board, and frankly, we've seen success across the board. In fact, on
the consumer side, we're expecting to grow deposits driven by some initiatives we have internally with business
checking accounts on small and medium-sized businesses, as well as consumers, as well as a further push to
better integrate our new mortgage customers into our checking ecosystem.
So I think we'll see consumer lift that won't necessarily be at the higher end costs, but we're also expecting to
grow commercial balances. And as Dominic alluded to, there have been opportunities for us to be selective and
proactive with new customers for the bank and we're obviously prioritizing new customers that come with
significant deposits at the right price point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
So maybe on that...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I also want to add that for our commercial clients, new commercial clients we brought in that have primary
operating accounts that transfer over to East West Bank, it's going to take some time to set up the cash
management, online banking and whatnot. And in order to have it fully operated, it's going to take a few months.
So therefore, there's going to be a gradual increase when it comes to the non-interest-bearing deposits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. And then maybe just to focus on the CDs and time deposits. It looks like you are seeing some good
traction there. I think I can see online that you're offering about a 4.5% rate. I guess it is slightly below market
given where other banks are. Can you talk about how you're able to do that? Is it because of the longer
relationships you have with your depositors? Is it relationship pricing elsewhere in the services you offer?

I think we've had success both with our [ph] rack rates (00:34:07), what you're referring to, and also on selected
new opportunities we're able to look at exceptions and opportunities to bring folks in on an individualized basis.
And I think that's one of the hallmarks of East West is they're able to look at the entire relationship and make
appropriate business judgments to move forward on individual opportunities. And that's been part of what's given
them their low cost base they have today and allowed us to continue to attract the right customers with the right
relationship going forward.

Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Clark with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hi, good morning, everyone. First one for me just on deposit, your deposit cost outlook kind of beyond the fourth
quarter. If the forward curve plays itself out, I guess how quickly do you think you might be able to start cutting
deposit costs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
There's going to be a bit of a lag over the near-term. But as soon as the Fed starts moving, I think it'll be a
function of how fast the Fed starts moving. So when rates fell precipitously and rapidly in 2020, the bank reacted
pretty well. And obviously it'll be a function of how and why the Fed moves as to how we'll react and lag on the
next turn here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, okay. And then on office CRE, one of your competitors had a couple of new non-performers on the
suburban side of office. Are you seeing any performance differences within your office portfolio as it relates to
suburban versus central business district?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, Matthew, we actually don't have much exposure at all for any kind of central business district, quite
honestly. And you can see that reflected really with the loan sizes as far as the size of the loan, if it's granular or
smaller, they're smaller properties. So based on that, I would say that most of ours is really more kind of suburban
or non kind of CBD.
With that said, I would say, as we continue to [indiscernible] (36:24) through the portfolio, although there are loans
that we are working out with clients, overall, we're comfortable with the grades, we're comfortable with the
strategy, and there's no major difference that we're seeing in one sector or region geographically.

call. And I'm just wondering, announcing it here, how much does that speak to your confidence in navigating the
current credit cycle?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I don't quite – Irene and Chris, did you hear the question? I didn't quite exactly heard it clear.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, maybe I'll start to answer your question. Look, I mean, I think as we look at the uses of capital, highest
[indiscernible] (00:37:35) of capital, also the growth of the capital, the confidence that we have, the capital will
continue to grow not just quarter-by-quarter. But if we look multi-year, this is part of our process, and quite
candidly, just where the capital levels are at. So I think in answer to your question, yes, we do think it is a
commentary on kind of the strength of where we see the franchise is, and what will happen with our capital levels.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. That's great. And then, maybe just talk to the recent management changes and how that relates to your
thinking on succession planning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
In fact, I think this is always at East West Bank's sort of like long-term plan, leadership development, succession
planning, and we are very pleased, in fact, that we're able to get Chris to join us in the CFO position, and which
allow us to get Irene to rotate to a very important position to be our Chief Risk Officer. We feel that, as our
organization continue to grow, it's going to be very important for us to make sure that we have very, very solid and
strong leadership both in the finance area and also in the risk area.
We can't think of any better person that can fill that Chief Risk Officer job going forward than Irene. And also,
thank goodness, Chris came in and shortly and act like he's been moonlighting at East West for years. So this has
been all working out pretty good for us, because I think we strengthened our executive leadership desk at East
West and this is going to be pretty good for us for many years to go.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
As it relates, Chris, to your comments about kind of planning longer-term, wondering if there are any additions to
the interest rate swap book, which I think was $5 billion as of June 30. Just a quick math, looks like the headwind
there was maybe $10 million or $12 million higher quarter-over-quarter versus the second quarter. So thinking
about how to view that going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Sure. Yeah. We did add a total of $750 million for the quarter, $250 million of which Irene had mentioned on the
last earnings call, another $500 million came after that, and we've done a further $250 million just for
transparency here in the fourth quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
[indiscernible] (00:40:24)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, with a forward start. So we're looking at essentially protecting against that downside risk as the previous
call alluded to [indiscernible] (00:40:35) the Fed moves precipitously downward, we're sort of protecting ourselves
against that profile.
The total cost collectively of all of the swaps for the quarter was $24 million, which is to say our income would
have been $24 million higher had we not put those in place, but we think that's prudent and appropriate protection
going forward that's costing us currently or cost us in the quarter 14 basis points to the NIM, but we think that's a
reasonable price to pay for that long-term insurance that we're putting in place.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
All right. I appreciate that. And just remind me, in your loan your slide, that shows 41% fixed, in hybrid and fixed,
is that adjusted for the swaps or adjusted is a little over 50%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
It is not adjusted.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, the 14, slide 14 numbers are the actual underlying loans and the swaps are an overlay to that. And again,
keep in mind that some of the swaps that Irene mentioned, the more recent ones have all been forward starting,
so there's a bit of a lag there before they'll take effect, but there's obviously a component.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 19-Oct-2023
Great. Maybe for the team, you talked about capital, [ph] use of capital (00:41:56) a lot, the buybacks seemingly I
think the market likes that. What about an appetite to reposition a portion of the bond portfolio given the move in
rates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Chris, I think we're always looking at the right portfolio strategies and I think we're going to be looking at our cash
positions, our portfolio strategies, and our growth dynamics as we look here at the fourth quarter going into
planning for next year and we'll take all of that into consideration. And I think, as Dominic has said, we're
shareholder friendly, we'll do the right thing, but we'll be very thoughtful about what that right thing should be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. Thanks, Chris. And then a lot of questions about office and maybe by the market. But Dominic, do
you think that's where the – we should be focusing? I mean, we've seen some C&I credits from some of your
peers go sideways this quarter. I guess if you were to kind of stack rank where you're most worried about credit
going into next year, like what would you say?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Right now, I'm not too concerned about much anything, frankly, from a credit perspective. We actually are in
pretty good shape. I mean, we do have a slight [ph] tick up (00:43:12) in terms of charge-off but it doesn't really
compare [indiscernible] (00:43:15) I mean almost like a no charge-off at all for the last two quarters. So I think that
we just kind of normalize at this point.
At this stage, I agree, I mean, if I look at the overall credit portfolio, I really haven't seen much that I would say
really got me concerned. I mean, I would reflect back five years ago, six years ago, I mean, this oil and gas
portfolio that we had was not very good and so we had a little bit of charge-off. But the nice thing about having a
very diverse portfolio that we have is that despite the fact that we have some challenges with our oil and gas
portfolio. The fact is [ph] we still are making (00:44:05) record earnings simply because everything else are doing
so well. So that one particular industry couldn't hurt us much.
So when I look at CRE right now, our office building, a lot of people have their eyes on it. And I'm pretty sure at
some point, we may take a hit here and there. It's just that the overall portfolio is not big enough, the size of this
portfolio, the size of loans, the average size as you can see is so small and our LTV is so low. And so therefore,
at the end of the day and the earnings for everything else is so high and I think that all-in-all, we should be in
great shape. So at this stage right now, I'm still not concerned.
And I would tell you though, I always expect that by the second quarter to third quarter, we'll be going through
recession, that's what I expected. A year, a year-and-a-half ago, it didn't turn out. And would it be like six months
from now or is that actually we're exactly in a soft landing, who knows.
But the way I looked at it is that doesn't really matter whether it's a recession or a soft landing. Our position is that
East West will continue to stay true to our philosophy, which is having a very diverse portfolio and having a strong
customer base and this is how we mature. At the end of the day, relatively speaking, we always end up doing
better [ph] than the other banks (00:45:39).
