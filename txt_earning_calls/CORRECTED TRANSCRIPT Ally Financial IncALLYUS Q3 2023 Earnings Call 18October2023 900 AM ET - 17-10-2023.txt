announcement that I will be leaving Ally in the next few months. Let me start by restating my confidence in the
strategic, operational and financial positioning of the company, as well as my deep trust in the leadership team to
flawlessly execute during and after this transition period. Ally has delivered a remarkable transformation, built an
incredibly strong foundation, and is positioned to thrive. I'm honored to have led our company and my teammates
through some of the incredible things we've accomplished during these nearly nine years as CEO. I came to
legacy GMAC to help with the financial restructuring, but I thought it would take three to four years.
Nearly 15 years later, we transformed a captive finance company, funded in capital markets, into a leading
automotive franchise, the largest all-digital bank in the country, and a very special brand. We successfully
navigated the Great Financial Crisis, returned $20 billion to the US Treasury coming out of TARP, and became an
investment-grade publicly traded company. Starting from basically zero, we've grown to $140 billion of deposits,
serving 3 million customers. Our auto and insurance teams serve more than 22,000 dealers across the country,
offering them a comprehensive set of products and services that help them grow their businesses. And we've
consistently given back to the communities in which we work and live, including the launch of the Ally Charitable
Foundation in 2020. But as I've said many times on these calls, what I'm most proud of is the culture we build
along the way.
It's this team and this culture that will drive Ally to continue to disrupt, innovate, and deliver value for all of our
stakeholders going forward. As we'll cover on today's call, the company is stronger than ever and positioned for
substantial earnings growth over the next several years. Leaving Ally is a difficult thing to do, but I'm excited to
see the next chapter of evolution and innovation, this time from the perspective of a customer. I think it's very
important to state there was no disagreement with our board for regulatory, financial or operational concern. This
was really the only call that could have pulled me away from leading Ally. My relationship with Rick Hendrick, his
family and the Hendrick Automotive Group excites me as I transition for my final chapter over the next 20-plus
years. Ally, in my entire time in the banking industry, has blessed me in ways I never dreamed. It has truly been
an honor for me.
I won't say goodbye quite yet, as I suspect I'll be with you again in January, but thank you for the support all of
these years. And with that, let's turn to slide number 5 to get into the quarter. Adjusted EPS of $0.83, core ROTC
of 13%, and revenues of $2 billion reflect another solid quarter of execution in a dynamic environment. I do want
to highlight a few notable items impacting the quarter. We recorded a $30 million restructuring charge associated
with a workforce reduction. We expect the actions we've taken will drive $80 million in annualized savings,
heading into next year as we manage towards meeting our expense target. Additionally, we continue to evaluate
ways to monetize certain tax credits and were able to realize some of those benefits this quarter with the release
of valuation allowance. We also realized benefits from certain state law changes.
While we don't expect these items to occur every quarter, the tax team has done an excellent job over the years,
identifying ways to drive book value and capital accretion. In aggregate, nonrecurring tax items provided a $94
million benefit worth $0.31 per share. These items are included in GAAP results, but we've excluded them from
adjusted EPS and core ROTCE. Moving to operational performance, we continue to see solid results across the
company. Within Auto Finance, we generated record application volume of $3.7 million, which resulted in $10.6
billion of originations and attractive risk-adjusted returns. Originated yields for the quarter were 10.7%, while 40%
of our volume came from within our highest credit quality tier as we continue to capitalize on strong returns within
this segment. In total, we've now achieved a cumulative pricing beta of 95% in retail auto, which reflects our
consistent approach to dealer engagement and positions us well for yield expansion from here.
Net charge-offs in the quarter were 185 basis points, which was in line with guidance and up quarter-over-quarter,
given typical seasonality. Russ will go into more details on credit shortly, but we feel good about what we're

seeing in terms of delinquencies, flow-to-loss rates and vintage performance. Within insurance, we continue to
successfully grow and deepen dealer relationships at $324 million of earned premiums with our highest figure
since 2009. Turning to Ally Bank, total deposits of $153 billion are up $7.1 billion year-over-year. We added
95,000 customers in the quarter, which results in 307,000 on a year-to-date basis, an Ally record. We're now
serving 3 million retail deposit customers, providing another proof point that our brand is resonating with
consumers. 1.2 million active credit card holders continue to represent long-term opportunities for the business,
and the launch of a One Ally experience will be completed in the coming months.
Corporate finance continued to deliver accretive discipline growth as nearly 100% of the $10.6 billion portfolio is in
a first-lien position. On slide number 6, we wanted to directly address some of the critical items that we're
navigating and what's top of mind for investors. From an interest rate perspective, we've talked for multiple
quarters about the near-term challenges of a rapidly rising rate environment. Operationally, throughout this cycle,
the businesses have been disciplined in managing pricing on both sides of the balance sheet. We've also
leveraged our strong ALCO processes, including an active hedging program, to soften the financial impact from
higher for longer rate scenarios. Beyond the near-term pressure, the momentum we have on the asset side of the
balance sheet positions us well for margin expansion when rates stabilize. Actively managing credit risk remains a
top priority.
We've refined our buy-box to eliminate underperforming segments and added significant price, particularly in
riskier segments to compensate for potential volatility. Based on where we see things today, we'd expect retail
auto NCOs of 1.8% for the full year, which is in line with the range we provided in January. This is a unique
environment where unemployment remains historically low; however, persistent inflation is a challenge for many
consumers. Delinquencies remain a watch item, but we saw another quarter of shallowing in terms of year-over-
year change and flow-to-loss rates remain strong. And consistent with prior guides, we assume a meaningful
step-down in used vehicle values for the remainder of the year. The investments in data science and technology
we've made within our collections and servicing teams will drive solid performance even in a challenging
environment.
We have a much deeper understanding of consumer payment patterns and more options to get consumers
current and staying in their cars. Given the near-term revenue pressure, we further heightened our focus on
expenses. Looking to 2024, we'll continue making prudent investments but see a path for less than 1%
controllable expense growth and roughly 2% on a total expense basis; I'll share more details in a few pages. On
the regulatory front, we continue to evaluate the proposals released in recent months and are preparing for
increased capital and liquidity across the industry. However, we believe that regulators should fully study the
implications of these proposals, and we are working closely with BPI and other advocacy partners. We will
continue to be disciplined in allocating capital across our various businesses to optimize risk-adjusted returns.
Slide number 7 shows the success we've had creating scale across Ally Bank and deepening relationships with
engaged customers. As mentioned, year-to-date customer growth of 307,000 is an Ally record and we now have 3
million retail deposit customers who hold $140 billion in balances. The portfolio is granular, diversified, and 92% of
balances are FDIC-insured. Customer retention has held steady at 96%, reflecting our industry-leading ability to
maintain relationships once customers experience Ally. The bottom half of the page highlights how our offerings
have led to an engaged customer base and the key benefits of that engagement. We've steadily grown our
checking or what we call our spending product to more than 1 million customers. Across that population, 77% also
have a liquid savings account.
More than 1 million deposit customers either leverage our smart savings tools, utilize direct deposit, and/or have
an Ally Invest relationship. We're approaching 300,000 multi-product customers across the consumer bank as

we've seen consistent adoption from deposit customers across Invest, Home, and Card. The benefit of
engagement is meaningful. As an example, deposit customers who also have an Invest relationship have a
balance two times those who don't. Our brand, digital offerings, and customer experience continues to hit the
mark, and we remain optimistic about the growth potential within the consumer bank moving forward. Moving to
slide number 8, we've provided a snapshot of our current funding stack and available liquidity. We're core-funded
with deposits as they account for 87% of our funding. But importantly, we have multiple sources of liquidity
beyond deposits.
On the right side, we show total available liquidity of $64.2 billion, representing 5.6 times uninsured deposit
balances. We meaningfully increased our capacity at the discount window within the quarter to further strengthen
the quality of our contingent liquidity. We pledged auto finance e-contracts at the discount window for the first time
and are appreciative for the engagement with the Federal Reserve as we work together through that process. The
events of March emphasized again the importance of contingency planning and ensuring multiple avenues of
liquidity being available at all times. The foundation of our funding profile is a mature consumer deposits franchise
and we maintain access to multiple other sources of liquidity, including a solid and stable relationship with the
home loan bank. Slide number 9 provides a summary of how we're thinking about recently proposed changes to
the regulatory environment.
For Ally, the most meaningful impact of the Basel III Endgame proposal is the phase-in of OCI. As a reminder, we
have not reinvested in the AFS portfolio in over a year and expect natural OCI accretion of around $500 million
after-tax annually, assuming the forward curve plays out. In terms of the proposed changes to RWA, our net
impact is not material as the addition of operational risk RWA is effectively offset by a lower risk weight on retail
exposures, including our retail auto portfolio. I'm confident we can naturally build capital to meet increased
requirements in advance of the proposed implementation periods. The proposed requirements for long-term debt
would result in incremental issuance for Ally given all our long-term debt sits at the parent company. The amount
of issuance will depend on several factors as we optimize parent and bank-level liquidity positions.
On all these issues, we're actively engaged in our industry response, including coordination with peer banks and
the Bank Policy Institute. We will continue to evaluate the regulatory landscape and adapt as needed but feel
comfortable in our ability to navigate the changes given our strong liquidity and capital position. Let's turn to slide
number 10 to talk about our expense outlook. As we previewed on the second quarter earnings call, we're
committed to 1% growth for the expenses we can control. When factoring things like FDIC fees and insurance
commissions and losses, we expect total operating expense growth of around 2%. We have taken specific actions
over the past year to reduce expense growth, including a hiring freeze in mid-2022 and a reduction in workforce in
recent weeks. It's also important to keep in mind that expense [ph] growth (00:16:32) this year was impacted by
the normalization of weather losses and consumer credit losses.
In total, we still anticipate 2023 expenses a little over $4.9 billion. And given the actions we've taken to-date, we
expect 2024 to be right around $5 billion, so around $100 million of growth with 80% of that coming in the form of
non-controllable items. We'll continue to make the right investments to fuel the company for the long-term, but the
specific actions we've taken and continued focus on efficiency are driving us to very modest growth in total.
With that, I'll turn it over to Russ to go through the detailed financial results.

Thank you, JB. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin on slide 11. Net financing revenue of $1.5 billion was down
year-over-year driven by the continued pressure on funding costs given increased short-term rates as the majority

of our consumer deposit portfolio is comprised of liquid products, while the strong pricing momentum we've
demonstrated on the asset side of the balance sheet partially mitigates the near-term compression and sets us up
for strong NIM expansion; we'll come back to NIM expansion in a few slides. Adjusted other revenue of $491
million increased year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, reflecting momentum within our insurance business as
well as our SmartAuction and pass-through initiatives in auto finance which we highlighted last quarter. Despite
modest investment gains, we're effectively at the $500 million quarterly run rate we've previously alluded to and
continue to see opportunities for expansion ahead.
Provision expense of $508 million was up quarter-over-quarter, reflecting seasonal trends and a modest reserve
build to support asset growth. Retail NCOs were in line with prior guidance. I'll provide a more granular update on
retail auto credit shortly. Non-interest expense of $1.2 billion reflects higher costs within Auto Finance relating to
application volume and higher repo cost seen across the industry. Record application volume drove higher
variable costs within Auto Finance, but has enabled us to achieve a nearly 95% pricing beta throughout the
tightening cycle. The incremental revenue driven by the strength of our pricing significantly exceeds the marginal
expense of increased application flow. We've also seen higher pricing from third-party vendors when vehicles go
to repossession. We remain focused on minimizing net credit losses and bottom line impacts to Ally.
Despite these headwinds, the year-over-year growth in expenses slowed this quarter as our efficiency initiatives
begin to take hold. As JB covered, our recent actions to reduce costs position us for $80 million in annual life
savings next year, and the anticipated year-over-year growth reflects our ability to navigate the near-term revenue
headwinds brought on by the higher interest rate environment. We've called out the $30 million of restructuring
costs, which have been excluded from core pre-tax results. GAAP and adjusted EPS for the quarter were $0.88
and $0.83, respectively. We've excluded the benefit of certain tax planning strategies from adjusted EPS to better
reflect underlying recurring results, but these tax benefits are a nice boost to capital generation. Moving to slide
12. Net interest margin of 3.26% was down 15 basis points quarter-over-quarter.
Momentum within earning asset yields continued in the quarter, but was offset by deposit cost as the OSA rate
moved up within the quarter. Total average loans and leases of $149 billion were up $8 billion year-over-year,
driven by growth within commercial and retail auto balances. Quarter-over-quarter growth of $1.5 billion reflects
our disciplined capital deployment as we focus on accretive risk-adjusted returns when originating. Earning asset
yield of 7.14% increased 15 basis points quarter-over-quarter and more than 150 basis points year-over-year,
given the cumulative impact of trends we've discussed previously, including retail auto portfolio yield expansion,
the increasing contribution from higher-yielding assets, and over $50 billion of floating rate exposure across our
commercial loan and hedging portfolios. Retail portfolio yield continued to expand this quarter as recent vintages
comprised a larger proportion of the portfolio.
I'll talk more about retail auto portfolio yield dynamics later. Commercial portfolio yields expanded alongside
benchmark rates, given their floating rate nature. Turning to liabilities, cost of funds continued to increase, but the
rate of change on both the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis slowed relative to 2Q, as we approach
the end of the tightening cycle. Competition for deposits remains intense and market pricing increased within the
quarter. But we have remained disciplined on pricing. The themes of our NIM trajectory are largely unchanged.
We expect NIM to trough a couple quarters after rates stabilize, followed by gradual expansion each quarter even
without the benefit of rate cuts. Moving to slide 13, our CET1 ratio increased quarter-over-quarter to 9.3% given
our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Our TCE ratio of 4.9% includes unrealized losses within our AFS
securities portfolio, which increased this quarter given the shift in long-term rates.
Based on the current forward curve, we expect around $500 million per year of after tax OCI accretion as we
allow the portfolio to roll off. We announced another quarterly common dividend of $0.30 for the fourth quarter,

and as mentioned earlier, the outlook for loan growth is modest and will be primarily comprised of auto assets at
attractive risk-adjusted levels. At current levels, we exceed our 7% regulatory minimum for CET1 by $3.7 billion.
Let's turn to slide 14 to review asset quality trends. Consolidated net charge-offs of 131 basis points increased
quarter-over-quarter given typical seasonal trends. Retail auto net charge-offs of 185 basis points were in line with
the prior guidance of 1.8% to 1.9%. We continue to see modestly offsetting impacts of slightly elevated
delinquencies and favorable flow-to-loss trends.
Severity levels were elevated early in the quarter, reflecting softer used values that strengthened in September. In
the bottom right, 30-day delinquencies increased seasonally, but the year-over-year change continues to decline.
Delinquencies will increase seasonally in the fourth quarter and we continue to assess the impacts of inflation, but
remain comfortable with our full-year NCO guidance. I'll cover retail auto credit in more detail shortly. Slide 15
shows that consolidated coverage increased 1 basis point to 2.73%. The total reserve balance of $3.8 billion was
relatively flat quarter-over-quarter and is $1.2 billion higher than CECL Day-1. Our macro assumptions assume
worsening employment conditions with unemployment reaching 4.3% next year before increasing beyond 6%
under our reversion to historical mean methodology. Retail auto coverage was flat at 3.62% and remains well
above the 3.34% on CECL Day-1.
The remaining weighted average life of our retail auto portfolio remains under two years, reflecting the coverage
we have for expected lifetime losses of this portfolio. Turning to slide 16, we remain focused on leveraging our
differentiated go-to market approach, coupling high-tech and high-touch, which has generated significant scale
and a competitive advantage. Record application flow enables us to be dynamic and selective in what we
originate and continues to drive strong risk-adjusted returns. Ending assets in the top right were up slightly
quarter-over-quarter as commercial balances gradually increased alongside modest growth in retail auto.
Originations of $10.6 billion on the bottom of the page demonstrates the scale of our franchise and the compelling
volume we're able to generate given application volume despite tighter underwriting criteria.
Given year-to-date volumes slightly above $30 billion, we remain on track to originate around $40 billion this year
in total consumer originations. Additionally, used comprised 66% of originations, which was up modestly quarter-
over-quarter and highlights our ability to navigate industry disruptions in new vehicle production. Non-prime again
represents less than 10% of retail originations in the quarter. Let's move to slide 17 to talk about the scale of our
auto franchise. Put simply, our goal is to help our dealers sell as many cars and trucks as possible. We
encourage them to send us all of their application volume. Increased application volume means increased
incremental work and cost on our side, but enables us to be selective on what we choose to originate in terms of
credit criteria and pricing. This year, we will decision 13.5 million applications or $400 billion in potential in loan
volume.
By optimizing within that application volume, we are on track to book around $40 billion in consumer volume, $37
billion in retail auto loans at an estimated 10.7% yield with approximately 37% of the volume in our highest credit
tier. Accessing 13.5 million applications is a result of unique scale and strong mutually beneficial relationships
with our dealer customers. And that scale allows us to adapt quickly to changing market conditions like we did
when returns in super-prime volume became more attractive earlier this year. Our ability to pivot up and down the
credit mix should also give you more confidence in our ability to continue booking very strong yields. Going
forward, we'll continue to leverage our platform to optimize our capital allocation within the auto business.
Let's move to slide 18, which highlights the tailwinds embedded in our retail auto portfolio. Throughout this
tightening cycle, we've demonstrated strong pricing on both sides of our balance sheet with retail auto beta
around 95% and a deposits beta around 70%. While origination pricing has been strong, the majority of the
portfolio is yielding 8% or less. Only 38% of the portfolio was originated this year. As we continue to originate

loans at today's pricing, the runoff of lower yielding vintages being replaced by current originations drive natural
yield expansion on our largest asset class. Assuming stable originated yields, turnover is projected to drive the
portfolio to 9.5% in 2024 and to 10% in 2025. On an $85 billion portfolio, that yield expansion drives meaningful
revenue growth over the medium term.
Obviously, the path of interest rates and the credit mix of our originations will impact the eventual yield migration,
but we remain confident retail portfolio yield will meaningfully increase over the next couple of years. On slide 19,
we provide context around retail auto credit trends to-date, as well as our outlook for the fourth quarter. As noted
previously, we ended the quarter with NCOs of 1.85%, in line with expectations. Additionally, the full-year outlook
remains on track for losses of 1.8%. The drivers of performance are consistent with what we've shared on recent
earnings calls. We continue to monitor delinquency levels, which have been elevated this year, but importantly,
flow-to-loss rates remain well below pre-pandemic levels and have been consistent throughout the year and
vintage performance trends have been encouraging.
Loans originated last year show improving trends as they season, and our strategic shift into higher credit quality
loans will ultimately reduce portfolio loss content. On the bottom left, we've again provided quarterly loss
expectations, which results in a full-year loss of around 1.8%. We've lowered the bottom end of our fourth quarter
loss rate expectation, given the support and used values we expect from the UAW strike, which I'll cover on the
next page. On the bottom right, we show the year-over-year change in 30-day delinquency rates, which has
declined again for the third quarter in a row. Slide 20 provides our latest view of used vehicle values given
performance year-to-date, which has resulted in values flat relative to year-end 2022, following a 4% decline in
the third quarter. We continue to embed a conservative outlook for used values and maintain our longer-term
outlook for declines, but the UAW strike is expected to provide support near term.
We are currently forecasting a 4% decline in the fourth quarter, and thereby, on a full year basis, as well. And a
long-dated strike could create a near-term support for used vehicle values, but would also pressure floorplan
balances and our insurance business. So the net P&L impact is immaterial overall. Let's move to slide 21 to cover
Auto segment results. Pre-tax income of $377 million reflected pricing momentum alongside higher provision and
noninterest expense. Provision reflected typical seasonality while expenses were the result of elevated repo costs
across the industry and requisite spend to support the strength and scale we just highlighted. On the bottom left,
we've highlighted the consistent progression in portfolio yields, up more than 160 basis points year-over-year.
Despite the progression to-date, the portfolio is still well below recent originated yields, once again highlighting the
prospective tailwinds to earning assets.
The bottom right chart summarizes lease portfolio trends. Gains declined quarter-over-quarter, but were favorable
year-over-year, given the decline in dealer and lessee buyouts. And we continue to stress the near-term net
impact from the UAW strike as used values are supported, but tighter supply could lead to elevated dealer and
lessee buyouts. Turning to insurance on slide 22. Core pre-tax income of $30 million was a result of the highest
earned premium revenue since 2009, partially offset by elevated loss activity given the highest severe weather
activity since 2014. The reinsurance we have in place kept our exposure, but weather was still a headwind given
favorability seen in the prior year. Our proactive engagement with dealers to mitigate losses was on display again
in the third quarter. Initial estimates for property losses from Hurricane Idalia exceed $2.5 billion. But given our
actions, we didn't incur any losses from the storm.
Named storms often give dealers the time to move inventories, but this still takes a lot of coordination. The
challenges one faced are the violent hail and windstorms with little warning, and that was more what was
encountered in the previous quarter. Written premiums of $335 million increased 15% year-over-year as we
remain focused on increasing dealer relationships and benefit from normalizing inventory levels. Our focus

remains on leveraging the scale we've established within Auto Finance and highlighting our full spectrum product
suite to dealers, driving further integration of insurance across our auto dealer base. Turning to slide 23, retail
deposits of $140 billion increased $1.1 billion quarter-over-quarter and $6.2 billion year-over-year, demonstrating
the strength and resilience of our leading franchise.
Total deposits of $153 billion were up $7 billion year-over-year. 95,000 net-new customers was our 58th
consecutive quarter of growth and year-to-date customer growth of 307,000 is the highest in Ally Bank's history.
2023 is on track for the highest annual customer growth in Ally Bank's history as customers become increasingly
aware of the opportunity to earn more on their savings and the value Ally provides beyond rates. And we continue
to see strong growth in multi-product customers which has grown by 30% annually over the past several years.
The continued evolution in consumer preferences driving the migration towards digital offerings provides a
tailwind for continued growth across the entirety of our customer base and products suite. Moving to slide 24, our
digital bank platforms provide diversification and deepen customer relationships.
Ally Invest complements the deposit franchise well as we once again saw 85% of new account openings from
existing customers as they leverage the ease of money movement between accounts within Ally. Ally Credit Card
added 53,000 new cardholders in the quarter, now 1.2 million strong as we prudently grow the portfolio. The
continued integration and launch of One Ally in the fourth quarter will accelerate our ability to deepen relationships
across Ally's product suite. Ally lending balances were relatively flat given our disciplined approach to underwriting
and capital allocation. Corporate finance results are on slide 25. Core pre-tax income of $84 million was up $13
million quarter-over-quarter, benefiting from higher interest rates given the entire portfolio is floating rate. The
year-over-year comparison was down slightly as an investment gain in the prior-year period did not repeat but
was largely offset by accretive disciplined asset growth.
The portfolio remains high-quality with 61% asset-based and 100% of loans are in a first lien position. Our HFI
portfolio balance of $10.6 billion shows modest growth, reflecting the team's discipline and focus on maximizing
risk-adjusted returns. Slide 26 includes details for mortgage finance. Mortgage generated pre-tax income of $26
million and $267 million of direct-to-consumer origination. Expenses were down $10 million year-over-year,
highlighting the benefits of a variable cost [ph] margin (00:35:20) model. More than half of our origination volume
came from existing deposit customers, highlighting the benefits of our One Ally experience and deepened
customer relationships. We remain focused on a great experience for customers rather than a specific origination
target. Slide 27 contains our current financial outlook for 2023.
The operating environment remains dynamic and interest rate volatility persists, increasing the difficulty in
providing granular guidance. But we're committed to maintaining a transparent approach to guidance based on
what we know currently. You'll notice the page is largely unchanged versus the outlook we've provided in July.
Assuming a forward curve from quarter end, peak Fed fund is unchanged versus 2Q guidance at 5.5% but cuts
have been pushed out considerably, continued competition for deposits has put incremental pressure on portfolio
yield which could tick up to 4.2% in the fourth quarter; and we see full-year NIM above 3.3%, likely in the 3.35%
area. Our expectation for full year 2023 other revenue remains $1.9 billion; and importantly, we're achieving the
$500 million quarterly run rate we guided to in January.
And as we covered previously, retail auto portfolio yield is still projected around 9% in the fourth quarter, with
continued expansion thereafter. Retail NCOs are expected to be at 1.8% for the full year, unchanged from prior
guidance, and no change to operating expense guidance as we limit spend to non-discretionary costs and
essential investments. We see the tax rate closer to 9% for the year given some of the tax planning items that hit
in 3Q. We expect our near-term effective tax rate to return to approximately 18% absent tax planning items as
we've had solid momentum in generating EV tax credits and expect that trend to continue. While elevated and

increasing interest rates are a headwind, we expect most of the tightening cycle is behind us and have positioned
the balance sheet for margin and earnings growth over the medium term and remain confident in our ability to
continue to execute and drive long-term profitability.
From my perspective, JB's news last week was a bit of a surprise. But when you unpack it and also realize his
love for cars and the Hendrick Group, this was simply the right next step for him. We are going to miss JB dearly
and, at the same time, we're excited for him. JB's news in no way changes how I feel about the opportunity or
Ally. I am excited for all that we have to accomplish, my fantastic teammates, and Ally's attractive financial
outlook. The scale businesses are in an enviable position. I remember talking to JB and the team about the moat
positions and it's clear that those have been established today.
And with that, I'll turn it back to JB.

Jeffrey Jonathan Brown
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thank you, Russ. I will certainly miss you and this entire team as well. The strategic priorities which guide
everything we do are unwavering and essential for our long-term success. First and foremost is ensuring we
maintain strong alignment between our culture and our stakeholders. We're focused on highlighting the
differentiated offerings across our businesses for both consumer and commercial customers. We'll continue
finding ways to disrupt the industry and remove friction for customers by delivering leading digital experiences.
And even more important in this dynamic environment is our disciplined approach to risk management and capital
allocation. I'm confident these priorities and this management team will help us deliver value for all stakeholders.
And with that, Sean, back to you. We can head into Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, Sean. [Operator Instructions] It comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.
Please proceed.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning, guys.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
JB, obviously, you gave a lot of color on the decision to exit the company. Maybe just to dig a tiny bit deeper, did
your view of the returns that the company is capable of generating over an intermediate timeframe impact the
decision at all? And if not, do you still believe mid-teens and $6 of EPS over time are still the right levels for this
company over time?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, Ryan. Thanks for the question. No. Financial outlook did not change or drive my decision in any way,
shape or form. I feel even more confident in the financial profile of the company going forward. I think obviously
rates, as Russ and I both alluded to, have been a big factor in driving some of the margin squeeze that we faced.
But as you start to roll the balance sheet forward – and I think we try to include three or four new slides this time,
it really hit those points. As you start to roll the balance sheet forward, I mean, you're going to be 4%-plus type
and then easily into the mid-teens. So this was not driven at all about any change in confidence on the strategic
outlook, the financial outlook. I think as you heard me say, this is [indiscernible] (00:41:16) Ally for nine years. I
had no real intentions to go.
But this was one call that I talked to my board about for really the past two years, that if this call ever came, that
would be the one call I'd probably take and at least listen to. And obviously, life sometimes throws you curveballs,
and that's what happened in this scenario. But Mr. Hendrick and the Hendrick Automotive Group, they're
unbelievable people and partners. Obviously, we touch so many thousands of dealers day in and day out. And
this is really the premier franchise that's out there. I'm respectful of all of our dealer partners. But this was really a
dream opportunity for me to go work with a man, a family, a company that I have got to know for a number of
years that I deeply love and admire. I mean, it's a big business, north of $12 billion in annual revenues. They sell
200,000 cars, big parts player, big work in the defense industry as well.
So it just so – it fit in so many reasons for me to make this personal decision. It is hard to leave Ally, a lot of great
teammates, and certainly that weighed on me as I made this decision, but nothing about the financial outlook, the
strategic outlook. And frankly, I think the next CEO that comes is going to have a financial profile that's pretty
damn attractive going forward. And so sorry for the long-winded response, Ryan, but that's really what drove this.

No change in my view or my degree of confidence, and it's going to be fun being an awfully big Ally customer

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. No, appreciate all the color on that, JB. So, Russ, hope all is well. And maybe you can dig in on the net
interest margin. I know you noted that NIM will trough a couple of quarters after rates stabilize, and I think you
said around 3.35% for the full year, which I think implies a couple of basis points decline in the fourth quarter. So
can you maybe just – Russ, maybe just flesh out a little bit the near-term margin dynamics? Do you think 4Q is
the trough? And then, can you maybe just unpack some of the numbers in the trajectory of the NIM under either
higher for longer or the forward curve, which, obviously, seems to be implying two to three cuts for next year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. Hutchinson A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Sure. Thanks, Ryan. Look, I think you're spot on in terms of thinking about 2023. And I think you're spot on with
the commentary in terms of rates troughing within a couple of quarters. I think the key question there is where do
rates go from here? And I think we are under the view that we are towards the end of the tightening cycle. And so
to the extent that we're already there, I think we could see rates start to expand through the first half of next year.
So you could see NIM start to expand in the first half of next year. To the extent that we're not quite there, but
close to it, that expansion could be delayed. All that being said, I think, as JB pointed out, as I pointed out earlier,
the dynamics of our portfolio and that replacement of facts that we pointed out in some of the pages earlier is
strong and it's real. And in our view, it is a question of timing in terms of rate expansion as opposed to a question
of if's.
And I would say, and we like to think about things here in terms of a stable rate environment, so a higher for
longer scenario. And in that context, we'd expect to 5 basis points to 10 basis points per quarter of NIM
expansion. And obviously, as you say, to the extent that we see cuts on the short end, we could see that
expansion expedited.

Hey. Morning, Sanjay. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah, it's been quite a ride. Maybe you guys can talk about where we are with the CEO search and what the
criteria might be – is it internal, external, any leaning in terms of that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Jonathan Brown A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Sanjay, thanks. I'd still say a bit of the early stages. I had obviously talked to my Chair of the board when I
was considering this. So the board and our search committee had a bit of time to sort of start structuring their own
thoughts about what a candidate profile would look like, all those things. So that is underway obviously now. And
the timing of this was really related. We had our board meeting last week, and at that meeting, that was when I
officially submitted my notice to leave the firm at that point in time. And so obviously, we went public last
Wednesday with this. But I'd say, the board is doing a great job. I'm excited to be able to say I'll be involved in that
process. And that's very important to me in finding the right type of leader in partnership with our board to really
carry Ally forward for the next 5, 10, 15 years.
So it's obviously easier. Things are out in the public domain that you can conduct an external search. We're
working with a leading global search firm. And so that's underway. And I think our board is very focused on trying
to get somebody that can really carry the culture of the company forward and also can continue to transform the
business. I'm very proud of what's been accomplished over nine years. But as I've said to every one of my leaders
and all of our employees and our board, it's never about one person. This has always been – this transformation
has been led by an incredible team, and I am fully confident in their ability to continue executing in this next
chapter. So I think a new leader will come in recognizing they have an exceptionally strong management team.
They have a hungry employee base. And all of us believe we – Ally has never really fully got the credit for the
transformation that's been executed.
And I think that's going to be a neat opportunity for our next leader to go and crack. And so it's underway, Sanjay.
I've obviously said I would be here through the end of January, if needed. I suspect that timing is going to be right
around the mark of when we'll bring in a new leader. But obviously, I'm going to be a very close customer of Ally.
And it's in my interest to ensure we get a great leader, a transformational leader, a culture carrier, a servant
leader, all those things that I think I've tried to be here. We get somebody that's even going to take that to the next
level. So it's underway. And I would hope by the end of January, you'll be talking to our next CEO.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Perfect. And then, my follow-up question. Appreciate slide 9, that sort of goes through all the implications of
the proposed regulation, but maybe if we take a step Russ, could you just maybe, over the next two years, how
should we practically think it flows through the P&L and the balance sheet? What specific lines does it impact? I
mean, maybe there's debt issuance, obviously, capital return. Maybe you can just talk about how we should think
about that over the next couple of years. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. Hutchinson A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, sure. Thanks, Sanjay. It's a great question. It's obviously one that's complicated by the fact that these are
proposals. And as JB mentioned earlier, we're working with BPI and other industry constituents to make sure our

feedback is reflected. And as you've heard, the industry has had a reaction to the proposals as they're currently
stated. All that being said, and maybe I'll start with Basel III Endgame, the biggest impact for us is in terms of our
AOCI. And I'll just make it clear. We can manage within that transition time period that it's been proposed so far
without doing anything unnatural. That is we can manage it organically. As you can imagine it, it's obviously
curtailed our share repurchases. And quite frankly, if you look at our auto business, you're just looking at the
attractiveness of the assets that we're seeing from our dealer partners, but we have certainly had to be restrained
in terms of our origination volume.
And it's also forced us to really make hard decisions around the growth trajectory of some of our growth
businesses. All that being said, we can manage within the timeframe that's been provided. And the only significant
real impact for us on the capital line is that AOCI inclusion. When you look at long-term debt and it's very early,
and as JB laid out on his slide, the binding requirement for us is the 6% of IDI at the bank level. Because as you
can imagine, our unsecured debt is issued at our holding company level. We actually don't have unsecured debt
at the bank level today. And so that's going to require us to – as the proposal is currently stated, it's going to
require us to really look through the liquidity we have at the HoldCo versus the bank level and look at our
issuance. And that could drive incremental issuance from where we sit today, which would obviously come with
additional interest expense.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then, I mean, just in terms of like – you could take that liquidity and invest it, too. So it wouldn't be the
full impact, right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. Hutchinson A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah, absolutely correct. And just to be clear, when you think about Basel III Endgame from an RWA perspective,
there are puts and takes, but we don't see any significant change to our RWA. That is – the increase in
operational RWA is completely offset by some of the benefits we see in our retail loan portfolio.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2023
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
All right. Thank you. Appreciate that. Question for you on slide 19. Just curious what the big picture messages on
auto credit performance, on what – it sounds simple but on one hand, the charge-offs are going up. On the other
hand, the delinquencies are going down. What's the message that you're trying to send? And as we look past the
fourth quarter into 2024 with the delinquency numbers, it feels like credit should actually be getting better. Is that
too simple?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. Hutchinson A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, maybe I'll start just to try and be as clear as possible about it. We very much see ourselves on
track towards the 1.8% NCO rate that we advertised last quarter. That being said, there's seasonality in terms of
our delinquency tracking. So what you see in the bottom left on page 19, as you see that seasonality expressed
through the NCO trajectory as we go from second quarter to third quarter, to fourth quarter. So fourth quarter is
typically when we see our highest level of NCO activity. And so we show the 2.2% to 2.4%. That 2.2% to 2.4% for
the fourth quarter is consistent with a full-year 1.8% NCO rate, so that's an expression of the seasonality in our
portfolio. On the bottom right, what we're doing is we're showing year-over-year change to get through some of
that seasonality issue. So the comparisons that you're seeing as you look at each of those quarters is 3Q 2023
versus 3Q 2022, 2Q 2023 versus 2Q 2022.
And so when you look at it on a year-on-year basis, you can see that those elevated delinquency levels that we're
currently seeing, you can see they're actually coming down. That year-over-year change is coming down each
quarter sequentially and has been for the last three quarters straight. And we think that's a reflection of a couple
of things. One, we implemented through curtailments and pricing a lot of changes to our portfolio recently, and we
are seeing that in terms of the performance of our recent vintages. It's early to tell; we're very early in those
vintages, but we're seeing real impact to our curtailment and pricing actions. On the other side of that, when you
look at our 2022 vintages, we are seeing improvement in those vintages with respect to our original expectations
as well. And so again, early days but we continue to see positive signs that keep us on track to that 1.8% NCO
rate.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah, okay. That's helpful, Russ. Appreciate that. And then just one follow-up on slide 12. The 4.04% deposit rate
that you had for the quarter, the average, you talked about intense pricing competition on deposits. But if the Fed
is done, is it as simple as that 4.04% just marches to your 4.25% savings rate or is there something else
happening on deposit costs? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. Hutchinson A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
It's also a great question. So we raised during early in the quarter, and so you'll see the full impact of our latest
OSA raise over the course of fourth quarter. And look, it's our expectation that because of the competition, and
we've always expected this, we continue to see deposit competition even after the last raise. And so where we
are now, we've – and you probably noticed in the presentation when we talked about our outlook, we've changed
our guidance. We were at 4.1% overall deposit yield for fourth quarter; we've moved that up now to, say, it's 4.1%
to 4.2%. So we're not ruling out the possibility of continued pressure on deposits and the possibility of increased
pricing going forward.

Chief Executive Officer & Director, Ally Financial, Inc.
Thank you very much, Bill. Appreciate that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. I wanted to follow up on the commentary and all the color you've already given on the
NIM guidance, and in particular your outlook for OSA rates. There's been a debate around the possibility that your
OSA rates may continue to face upward pressure and ultimately, you have to converge with the Fed funds rate.
Historically, [indiscernible] (00:57:30) environment, Ally offered rates above Fed funds and I guess there's just
concern that that upward pressure on deposit beta could persist as long as Fed funds continues to exceed the
rates that you're offering. Just, I guess, your thoughts around that and the potential for further offsets from betas
on asset yields would be great.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. Hutchinson A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Great. Look, we think we're at the end of the tightening cycle. Assuming that's true, we do think there's a
possibility that our OSA rates tick up slightly from here. But I do say it's a possibility. I'd say the trends that we're
seeing in our deposit book have actually been quite favorable. As JB pointed out and as I mentioned during the
presentation, we've had a really great quarter in terms of attracting new customers. We're about to have a record
year, in fact, in terms of attracting new customers to our platform. We are not the highest payer right now when
you look at our liquid deposit rates. But again, we continue to have incredible momentum with our customer base.
We're seeing it in terms of strong retention, we're seeing it in terms of customers taking advantage of things like
our savings toolkit, and we're seeing it in terms of new customer growth.
And so while, yeah, we do think that there's a possibility that we could tick up on OSA pricing, we think it's just
that it would be marginal, a marginal uptick. And again, at this point, I would characterize it as a possibility, not a
certain outcome.

Bill Carcache Q

volatility into regulatory capital, there's been some debate around whether this could lead the banks to have to run

with a bigger buffer than they have historically. Maybe if you could just speak to any changes to your long-term
capital targets or should we continue to expect sort of that 9% range for CET1?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. Hutchinson A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Look, I think there are a number of kind of puts and takes into the proposal. There's obviously a lot of gold-
plating around certain asset classes. And I would say, look, when I look at our 9% management target now, that's
a full 2 percentage points north of our regulatory requirement. So right now, we're sitting at 9.3% with
approximately $3.7 billion of excess capital relative to the regulatory minimum. I feel pretty good about where our
capital is and I don't anticipate any significant changes to how we manage capital going forward.

Kevin J. Barker Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. I just want to follow up on the NIM conversation. In particular, the projection for over 4% NIM at some point,
it seems like in 2025. Now, in your view, given the current rate environment and the additional rules around debt
issuance or potentially different Basel III changes, do you expect to achieve that 4% some time in the run rate
with late 2024? Or do you feel like you could achieve it sometime in early or late 2025, just given the current rate
environment as you see it today?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. Hutchinson A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I'd say and I'll address your question in a stable rate environment rather than speculate around the timing
of rates. But I'd say, in a stable rate environment, our expectation is still crystal clear to get to 4% NIM. I think
we're kind of looking at the portfolio replacement impact. I think you could see us there entering 2025.

Russell E. Hutchinson A

Caveat that with the view that I don't want to be in the business and speculating in terms of how our short-term
rates go.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin J. Barker Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. Makes sense. And then, just a follow-up on your estimated origination yields. Do you feel like you can
maintain that 10.7% auto origination yields through the next foreseeable future, just given the competitive
environment for auto lending? We've seen quite a few banks pull back from the sector in the last year, but seem
to be reengaged in. Do you feel like that 10.7% is a adequate number or at least a stable competitive
environment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. Hutchinson A
Chief Financial Officer, Ally Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I do actually. The pull-back in competition this time around, I actually think has more durability to it than
what we've seen in past cycles. For a number of folks, this isn't a core business for them. And I think that the
regulatory capital pressures that other folks are on, it really has forced people to make hard decisions and to
really focus on the businesses that they're best at. We've certainly had to think through our capital allocation
across various businesses at Ally. But as you know, the Auto Finance business is absolutely core for us. And so I
think the pullback in competition, when you look at players, they haven't just dialed back their originations. Many
have exited the market altogether. And I think that creates a durability to this competitive environment that we're
currently seeing. So, yeah, I do think we can maintain our rates.
And I would just say just when you unpack our yields, remember, we've increased pricing at the same time that
we've been tightening credit. And so we've lifted the credit profile of our originations at the same time that we've
increased pricing. If you were to look at it on a same credit basis, our pricing has actually increased significantly
more than what we show in terms of this 10.7% yield and the 95% beta that we've printed. So, yeah, I think there
we have a number of levers in place. And I do think that the competitive environment that we're seeing now is
durable and so will give us the ability to maintain that 10.7% yield for a while. And I don't want to speculate on
rates coming down, but obviously, rates coming down create a tailwind for us just in terms of that portfolio
replacement effect that's currently causing a headwind.
