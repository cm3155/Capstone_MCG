Kelly S. King
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our first Truist earnings call. Thank you for
your support. What you're going to say is, overall fantastic progress in one year. And I would say to you, generally
if you liked our company a year ago, you should love us now. As we go through this information, we're going to be
completely transparent. But as you would expect, it's going to be messy. We don't know all that you want to know.
But our pledge to you is that over the next quarter or two, we'll give you more and more as we go along.
Some of the highlights which you probably already know, but we did successfully closed the deal on December 6.
And this is interestingly largest financial transaction â€“ institution transaction in 15 years. And these two iconic
companies have 275-plus combined years of service, which is huge. We are the sixth largest US commercial
bank. We have the number two weighted average deposit market share in our top 20 MSAs, and we're about
$473 billion in assets.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 30-Jan-2020
I think very, very importantly, before Legal Day 1 which is less than 60 days ago, we had all managers in place,
entire organizational structure today is set and running. No confusion about who's doing what, so that's a really,
really big deal. We've done a lot of work with regard to our culture. I'll talk about that in a moment, but it feels
really, really good. And we've made much progress in other areas.
I want to spend just a minute on culture, because this is the most important consideration for all of us. Culture
drives long-term performance. There is no question about that. And therefore, it is our number one priority. The
way we think about culture is that culture is a function of our purpose, our mission and our values. There are
certain practices; the kind of way we do things around here and there's a whole process of embedding the culture
into the organization. But the most important thing to think about is our purpose, our mission, and our values.
Our purpose at Truist is to inspire and build better lives and communities. We really believe we can make the
world better and we think that is exactly what major corporations are called upon to do today. We execute our
purpose through our mission which is focusing on taking care of our clients through a really good environment for
our teammates; and of course, optimizing long-term value for all of our stakeholders. Most importantly, all of our
mission efforts are guided by our longstanding deep beliefs which we call values.
Our values at Truist are about being trustworthy; we serve with integrity. It's about being caring; we know that
everyone and every moment matters. It's about one team coming together; we can accomplish anything working
together as a team. It's about success; we know that when our clients win, we all win. And for our teammates, it's
about happiness; a sense of positive energy changes lives. And we ultimately want all of our teammates to be
happy because when you're happy, you don't have a job, you have a passion. And we want everybody to be
passionately focused on accomplishing our purpose.
We know that we're very, very closely aligned. Early on in this process, we got really good research from our
59,000 teammates. For example, early on, we gave them 16 words to describe their companies. We got over
10,000 responses from each side. They all picked exactly the same four words. Couple months later, we had
scientific research where we asked again over 20,000 teammates divided between the companies to describe the
company in terms of how we operate, and they described it almost exactly the same.
Just week before last, we've started a series of 39 town halls, where Bill Rogers and I went around and started
talking to our teammates and answering questions. Week before last we did 11 of 39; next week we'll do another
11 or 12. And I will tell you that the responses are fantastic. Our teammates are excited. They love our culture.
They love our purpose. They love our brand. They love our colors. They love our logo. So it is off to a really, really
good start.
But I want you to feel confident as investors that this is not two companies struggling trying to come together, this
is two companies that were already deeply aligned in terms of our purpose, our mission, and our values.
Everything we've seen over the last year affirms just that. And now there's a renewed level of excitement from
everybody, as we think about coming together as Truist and going out and making the world a better place.
Let's talk about some of the highlights. If you're following along on page 6, total taxable-equivalent revenue was
$3.6 billion. Adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $1.046 billion, and that's up 29%. But
like all these numbers, you got to know that they obviously inflated because of the SunTrust impact on the BB&T
numbers, as we added 25 days towards the end of the fourth quarter. So, we won't dwell so much on the specific
changes, but we did make over $1 billion.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 30-Jan-2020
In terms of diluted earnings per share, adjusted is $1.12, and I will give you some detail in terms of how that
adjustment was arrived at. Return on average assets adjusted 1.4%, very strong. Return on average tangible
common equity 18.6%, which right out of the shoot is really, really good; again on adjusted basis. And adjusted
efficiency ratio is 57.5%. Both companies, to give you a sense of momentum, grew loans at a healthy pace when
you ex out some restructuring which Daryl will talk about. But underlying growth is very good, the pipelines are
very strong, and we feel very, very good about momentum.
Asset quality is great and we've taken some actions to optimize the portfolio from a credit perspective. Our capital
and liquidity levels are excellent. Daryl will give you detail about that. Our businesses, as I said, have good
momentum. We talked to bankers all across the footprint. Pipelines are strong. People are excited about doing
business with Truist. The launching of the Truist brand, colors, logo could not have gone better. I want you to
know that we are primarily focused on serving our clients. We are laser-focused on making sure our clients have
a distinctive, outstanding and service quality relationship with Truist.
We're going to talk about cost saves, and Daryl will give you a lot of detail that we have available for that. But I
want you to know, from my perspective, we have made a decision to slow the timing down just a few months. And
we did that to improve client service quality, to ensure strong client retention, to improve the long-term value
proposition. This is about really the digital investments that we're going to be making when you get some of those
made before we actually roll out the conversion. And so, the branch conversions are delayed some. A part of that
was because of the agreement we reached with regulators; part of that was because we wanted to delay it some
to make sure again we have a digital value proposition in place.
Still we are very, very confident on our net $1.6 billion in savings. So, this should not be viewed as a negative; this
is the positive. It's the same number. We've simply taken just a little bit longer to make sure we do it and do it
right. Our non-performing assets were fantastic at 0.14% and net charge-offs were right in the sweet spot of what
we've always indicated at 0.40%, and a very strong common equity Tier 1 capital of 9.4%. So we feel really, really
good about asset quality and capital.
If you look at page 7, I'll just mention these selected items. There're really just three that are large. The merger-
related restructuring charges are $223 million of pre-tax, which is $0.19 negative impact on diluted EPS. We have
security losses; because of our balance sheet restructuring, that was $116 million which translates into about
$0.10 in terms of negative impact on the EPS. And then we have some expenses that are not technically from an
accounting point of view designated as merger-related, but they are incremental operating expenses. They do
have future benefit, but they're not part of our ongoing run rate. So you can kind of think about them the same.
The main thing is, they don't impact future run rate. So when you add all that together, you get a net negative
impact on our ongoing run rate of $0.37, which is substantially why you see the difference in GAAP and our
adjusted numbers.
If you look at page 8, just a few comments with regard to loans. We did have an end-of-period balance of about
$300 billion. Really good mix. The mix of loans held for investment consisted of 56% commercial, 40% consumer,
about 2% credit card. So pretty balanced. Over time, you might expect to see the consumer grow a little faster
than commercial to get a little closer to 50/50. But we feel really good about where we are starting out. We did
take some actions, which Daryl will give you more color on, with regard to the portfolios. But I would just point out
that the year-end portfolio loans are a little bit inflated by about $4.5 billion because of the loans that have moved
into loans held for sale and they're sold, but haven't closed yet. So they'll close very, very soon.
So, as we think about the overall market, just in talking to an awful lot of our regional presidents and market
presidents, I would say that the overall market is pretty good. CEOs are confident in their businesses. But in

fairness, they are nervous. They're worried about the macro issues, the trade war, Iran, the coronavirus, we're 10-
plus years long into recovery. So while we do not expect a recession in the near term, I would say in fairness we
could sort of talk ourselves into one. So, it's a little bit of a nervous period right now. I think we need to be honest
about that. But that's one of the reasons that Truist always remains strong in terms of capital and liquidity.
In the event these existential factors do create an interruption in terms of ongoing business, but we don't really
predict one now. We really think this will settle down. We certainly hope and pray that this coronavirus does not
get out of hand, but we all have to be really concerned about that. There are a lot of people around the world
being hurt, a lot of people are dying, and we've got to really hope that that does not become a global systemic
issue. And I personally don't think it will, but we have to pay a lot of close attention to that.
If you're looking at slides on page 9, just a couple of comments with regard to deposits. We did end up with non-
interest-bearing deposits of about $92 billion and total deposits of about $335 billion. If you exclude the purchase
accounting, non-interest deposits declined just a little bit in the third quarter. Everybody, I believe, is seeing a
continued shift out of non-interest into time, and we've seen the same thing. It's not any different than anybody
else is facing, but our interest deposits did increase a strong 9%. So you can see what's going on. Our total
deposit activity is very good. It's just a little shift going on.
We have strong non-interest deposits that total 30.6%; one of the best in the industry. So we feel good about that.
Our total cost of average total deposits and average interest-bearing deposits, respectively, decreased 10 basis
points in 2017. So, actually pretty good there given the relatively flat yield curve. We're very happy to report that
we are telegraphing to our clients that virtually all of our clients will not experience any change in their account
numbers. Having been involved in lots and lots of mergers over my career, I can tell you that the big issue for the
client is change. And the main thing about change is, don't change my account number.
So we've worked out a way and I congratulate our people for virtually all of our clients not to have any changes in
their account numbers. So we predict that it will go extraordinarily smoothly for our clients, which is certainly our
goal. So overall, even though it's a little hard to see through the numbers, our balance sheet is strong, strong
earnings, tremendous progress in moving Truist forward, and we're very excited and we're very confident.
With that, let me turn it to Daryl, and he'll give you a lot more detail and a lot more color.

Daryl N. Bible
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Truist Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kelly; and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 10, net interest income was $2.25 billion. Net
interest margin was 3.41%, up 4 basis points versus the third quarter. Purchase accounting contributed 27 basis
points to reported net interest margin. At the end of the year, our final purchase accounting marks included $4.5
billion against the SunTrust loan portfolio, an $83 million upward adjustment to CDs, and a $309 million upward
adjustment to long-term debt. These marks were close to the recent estimates that we provided based upon
September 30 data. We plan to true-up these marks in the first quarter, as the final valuation numbers come in
from our third-party provider.
Core net interest margin was 3.14%, down 15 basis points from the third quarter. The yield on loans held for
investment decreased 6 basis points, as the effect of lower short-term rates was partially offset by a 37 basis
point benefit from purchase accounting. The balance sheet restructuring improved our securities yield by 5 basis
points and achieved our goal of a relatively neutral interest rate risk profile.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 30-Jan-2020
Continuing on slide 11. This summarizes our balance sheet restructuring, which is focused on improving credit
quality, liquidity, interest rate sensitivity, net interest margin, and return on capital. Through the restructuring, we
improved the run rate on the investment portfolio, built liquidity to meet our LCR requirements, re-hedged the
balance sheet and managed towards a more neutral interest rate position. We sold loans to manage negative
convexity, reduced premium amortization and enhanced credit quality by exiting $1.4 billion of high-risk credit
exposures, of which $516 million was funded at year-end. About 80% of that sale traded in January.
Through the end of January, we lowered interest rates on about $17 billion of institutional deposits by 20 basis
points because of our higher credit ratings. We will continue to be opportunistic in optimizing other funding to take
advantage of Truist's higher credit ratings. We also estimate that year-end loans held for sale were elevated
relative to normalized levels by approximately $4.5 billion and that the securities were elevated by approximately
$1.4 billion. This means the balance sheet should settle slightly under $470 billion in total assets.
Turning to slide 12. Non-interest income increased $233 million after excluding $116 million in security losses and
$22 million in losses related to the transfer of residential mortgages held for sale. Approximately $215 million of
the increase was due to the merger. The rest was due to a $22 million increase in insurance income due to
seasonality and minor changes in heritage BB&T fee income categories. Of note, full year 2019 insurance income
had organic growth of 8.8%.
Continuing on slide 13. Non-interest expense was up $497 million after excluding $189 million increase in merger
and restructuring charges and $49 million increase in incremental operating expenses related to the merger.
Approximately $400 million of this was due to core expenses from the merger. The remaining increase was due to
$42 million in heritage BB&T incentives and $42 million in amortization due to higher CDI and other intangibles.
Turning to slide 14. Asset quality remained strong. NPAs increased $175 million to $684 million. The increase
was due to the merger and included $107 million of acquired non-performing loans held for sale, $63 million of
loans and leases held for investment, and $63 million of foreclosed real estate partially offset by the sale of $69
million of non-performing mortgages. NPLs were 15 basis points of total loans held for investment at the end of
the year, down from 30 basis points at September 30. A decrease in the ratio was mostly due to the effect of
accounting for acquired NPLs on a pooled basis in PCI. This effect on the ratio will reverse with the adoption of
CECL and the transition of pooled level accounting for PCI.
Net charge-offs increased $39 million and were 40 basis points of average loans, down 1 basis point from last
quarter. The provision increased $54 million due to higher net charge-offs and an increase in the provision for
unfunded commitments. Our allowance was 52 basis points of loans held for investment at year-end, down from
105 basis points at September 30 due to the elimination of the SunTrust allowance. We would note that the
combination of our allowance and unamortized fair value mark is a very robust 2.01% of total loans. The
allowance recovery ratios also remained strong at 2.03 times net charge-offs and 3.41 times NPLs.
Continuing on slide 15. Effective January 1, Truist adopted CECL, the new accounting standard related to credit
losses. As a result, this did not impact our 2019 financial results. However, the impact at adoption was an overall
$2.9 billion increase in the allowance for credit losses. The magnitude of this increase was significantly impacted
by purchase accounting related to the merger. We were not required to carry allowance on the acquired loans
from the transaction at year-end due to the related purchase accounting marks.
Excluding the impact of purchase accounting, the implementation of CECL resulted in an approximate 40%
increase in the allowance for credit losses. This reflects increases that are related to our consumer and mortgage
portfolios, partially offset by the decrease in our commercial loan portfolio. In terms of capital, the increase in the
7

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 30-Jan-2020
allowance due to CECL resulted in a $2.1 billion after-tax reduction to retained earnings. Truist has elected to
face any impact to regulatory capital by 25% annually from 2020 through 2023.
Turning to slide 16. Our capital ratios decrease due to the merger, but remained strong relative to regulatory
capital levels for well-capitalized banks. Our CET1 ratio was 9.4%, down from 10.6% in the third quarter. The
benefits of purchase accounting will be partially offset in the first quarter by a 10 basis point impact from the
treatment of MSR risk-weighted assets under the simplification rule and a 14 basis point impact from the CECL
phase-in. At December 31, tangible book value per share increased 5.2% from September 30. Earnings during
the quarter contributed 3.4% of the increase. And the merger with SunTrust contributed 1.8%, confirming the
close was accretable to tangible common equity. Compared to December 31, 2018, tangible book per share
increased 18.5%.
Continuing to slide 17. We realized 2020 may be challenging to analyze and model. So we are providing more
guidance than usual. Our guidance is largely dollar-based due to the absence of historical baselines to which
growth rates can be applied. Some highlights from our first quarter 2020 guidance includes, average earning
assets to be plus or minus $406 billion. We expect reported net interest margin to be in the mid- to high-3.40s and
core margin to be just over 3%. Net charge-offs should range from 35 basis points to 50 basis points and fee
income should be just over $2 billion.
Our expense guidance includes $100 million to $150 million in merger expenses. For the full year, we expect the
balance sheet to grow based upon our guidance. Net charge-offs should remain relatively stable, particularly no
significant deterioration in the economy. And expenses will trend down each quarter until we achieve an annual
run-rate expense savings of about $480 million in the fourth quarter.
Turning to slide 18. We are also providing medium-term performance targets for about three years. We are
confident Truist can generate peer-leading return on tangible common equity in the low-20s and an adjusted
efficiency ratio in the low-50s over the medium term. In terms of capital, we are targeting 10% CET1 ratio for
2020. We are also confident we will achieve $1.6 billion in net expense savings through 2022. But we are
updating the expected timing of our expense net savings. This is primarily due to our commitment to the
regulators not to close overlapping branches for the â€“ at least the first year, and careful and cautious approach to
systems integration to minimize client disruption.
By the end of 2020, we expect to achieve a run rate equal to 30% of our net cost savings target; by the end of
2021, 65%; and by the end of 2022, a full $1.6 billion. All of this will drive positive operating leverage for the next
three years. For reference, 2019 combined non-interest expense excluding merger expenses, a one-time
charitable contribution and amortization was approximately $1.8 billion. We expect to achieve an annual run rate
of investment of approximately $200 million by the fourth quarter of 2020. These investments will be directed
towards personnel, branding, digital and technology.
Now, let me turn it back to Kelly, for an update on the merger and closing thoughts and Q&A.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Thanks, Daryl. So if you take a look at page 19, just to summarize, just a lot of really, really good
accomplishments so far. We also closed the deal, we've integrated the financial reporting system. We've
integrated and converted derivatives, Workday, a number of other systems. We have successfully retained our
talent and our clients, any concern about any mass exodus on that is not warranted. We've restructured the
balance sheet. We've launched our visual imagery, colors and logo. We've introduced our culture: purpose,

mission, and values. And I'm happy to say, we've added some key leadership in certain areas, particularly in the
digital space.
So, kind of what's coming up in a big picture perspective is that we are now working hard on completing the
product mapping which allows then to go into the development. We will be continuing to complete another 28
town halls. We'll be doing about 12 next week, so that continues on. We'll continue to focus on deepening our
relationship with our clients. We will complete the branch divestitures in a few months. We will complete the
purchase of our new Truist Center headquarters here in Charlotte. I just mentioned that because that's a pretty
big deal in this market and for our people. Our people are really excited about being in a 47-story iconic building
that shows well in Charlotte. We'll be introducing and marketing our Truist brand and we'll continue investments in
digital and technology. And then, we'll phase-in to the conversion of the primary systems.
So, overall, it was a very strong quarter. As we said a year ago, we have two great companies coming together to
create a very special company. We are in great markets. We have great economics. We have a very strong
culture. Everyone is excited about our purpose. We have the opportunity to make the world a better place. You
got to love Truist.
So, I'll turn it back over to Rich.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Daryl, can you share with us on the credit side the provision for the guidance for 2020? Seems pretty robust. Did
CECL have an impact on what you guys are looking for? Because considering that you mark-to-market all those
loans at the time of closing without CECL, I would have maybe expected the provision maybe to be a little lower?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, Gerard. So, we basically adopted FASB's guidance on how CECL operates. Our auditors, PwC, feel very
comfortable with what we've booked on 1/1 of 2020. In essence, if you back out the purchase accounting, it's a
40% increase of the two banks combined we're both around $105 million or $106 million allowance. We're up to
about $147 million.
If you add in reserve for unfunded it's about $161 million. But then that's what the guidance basically told us to do,
and that's why we booked that. I do agree though there is a double-dipping there. I mean, that is definitely positive
because we have purchase accounting marks of $4.5 billion on the SunTrust loan portfolio, and now we have a
reserve at $147 million on their loan book as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then, Kelly and Bill, when you guys â€“ on slide 19, you listed your accomplishments so far and
now the next steps. Can you share with us how challenged are the â€“ is the heaviest lifting ahead of us or has it
already been accomplished? Can you compare and contrast what you've already accomplished with what you still
need to do in terms of the degree of difficulty?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Good question, Gerard. I'll take a start and then Bill can add to that. I would say in all honesty, the heaviest lifting
you've done because pulling two companies together early on to make sure that you don't have any cultural
interruption, that you don't have any clashes in business strategies, that you should still feel confident in terms of
achieving the expense saves. All of those are â€“ we feel better today than we felt a year ago. I have to say it for
myself and I think Bill will echo this. A week before last when we visited 11 town halls, we talked to about 6,000
teammates.
And if you'd have been in that room, number one, you've had said, , these people have been working together for
25 years; and number two, you'd have felt the level of excitement was just extraordinarily high. And so, mezz work
has got to be done with regard to programming. And then taking the thing away from that, there's really, really
10

hard work. But at this point, the organization is settled, strong, focused, and we are just now focusing on doing the
connectivity work that is big, but is predictable in terms of how well we can do it. Bill?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think Kelly and I looked at this through the same lens in terms of what's hard and what's easy. And the
hard part and the most important part is getting the cultural alignment and making sure that they are â€“ and I think
Kelly has articulated that really well and I feel exact same way. And if that wasn't there then that would be some
concern and that would make the road ahead harder.
So, I think we've set a really good foundation for the road ahead. That's not to diminish the fact we have a lot of
work. So, we've got a lot of systems integration to do and revenue synergies to achieve, and all of those things.
But what I think we would align on is the highest hurdle, is it working and is the company culture aligned and are
we leaning forward? And I feel great about that.

Hey. Good morning, everybody. Congratulations on your first quarter's combined entity. A couple of questions.
First, on your marks and in the outlook for purchase accounting accretion, I think the mark is about $4.5 billion,
not too different from â€“ in your last five. And Daryl, can you just walk us through whether that calculation has
changed at all with regards to how much of its credit, liquidity, and rate marks, and the purchase accounting
accretion trajectory as well. If you can talk to that, because I think this â€“ your guidance implies about I think $1.6
billion of purchase accounting accretion this year. How does that move forward also beyond 2020? How do we
think about the glide path of PAA and how it impacts numbers beyond this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Thank you for the question, Saul. So first, I would tell you that's $4.5 billion that was booked that we're
showing from December 6 that will be marked. About 60% of it is credit related or 1.8%. It came down a little bit.
But it's really closely aligned to â€“ I mean, our CECL was â€“ reserve for unfunded was in the 1.60s. So, it's just a
little bit more than that, obviously due for a little bit different methodology, but it's very consistent from that impact.
The other part, the other 40% is mainly attributable to liquidity and interest rate risk.
We did put in one of the slides that the commercial portfolio probably has an average life of around three years,
consumer around six. I would say, it's going to ebb and flow of how contractual payments come through as well
as prepayments. You will definitely see a downward trajectory on the purchase accounting accretion that's coming

through. But at the same time, what you're going to see is our cost savings â€“ our net cost savings really kick in.
And over that same time period, and you will actually still see improvement on a consistent basis on our operating
leverage number. Just because the calculation of how efficiency works with expenses over revenue, for every
dollar we save it's worth $2 of revenue that's lost. So, we still feel very good about the projections that we gave
from that perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Got it. And I guess, a follow-up there. Adjusting for purchase accounting accretion, the guidance implies
about â€“ by my calculation about $12.2 billion to $12.5 billion of net interest income ex-ing out PAA. If I look at the
combined entity, historically SunTrust, BB&T, the run rate's been about $13 billion. Can you just walk us through
what's driving that difference? I know there's a lot of balance sheet restructuring going on, but it does seem to
imply that the core NII, there's some degradation there ex-ing out the PAA. Am I understanding this right? Can
you just walk me through like what's driving that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, if you really look at the balance sheet restructuring, we didn't shrink that much. I mean, the mark
was $4.5 billion. So the loans didn't sell, we just basically wrote down the loans. We did sell mortgages.
Mortgages, if you look at it, over the last couple of quarters is down about $10 billion. But pretty much everything
else is consistent. The big reason why NII is down, if you go back a year ago and you looked at like what we were
projecting, our models and all of our peers' models had interest rates still rising at the start of 2019.
And we actually went back and did a little homework. We looked at what estimates were back then, and we
compare them to what estimates are right now. And across the board, the peer average is down 20 basis points
to 25 basis points, and that's just because of the lower rate environment and the flatter curve that you're seeing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. So it's really just the rate backdrop [ph] versus (00:37:51) degraded NII?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Truist Financial Corp.
Correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
All right. I mean, I guess I get that, but like even if I look at the third quarter, Daryl, combined NII pro forma was
about $3.25 billion or $13 billion annualized. So this quarter, I guess, there's some degradation there, but it seems
like a pretty big drop off.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: We'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Thanks for the update on some of the kind of planned milestones that we should be focusing on,
on page 19. But I guess, I want to focus on just the systems conversions and what are the big ones that we
should be thinking about that will drive the cost saves. And it seems like banks have done a pretty good job
converting various systems in recent deals, [ph] it can always be a risk (00:39:18). So, what's the timeframe for
some of the bigger systems conversions? And I guess, just what should we be looking for to make sure they go
well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
So, Matt, clearly the biggest is the overall deposit conversion because that's what drives the interaction with the
clients. Loan conversion is a big deal, obviously. I would say, those are the two larger ones. We have about 3,000
programs that have to be dealt with, 100 ecosystems. So, there's a lot of them. But it's like any other bank, the
primary is loans and deposits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q

Matt O'Connor Q

Timing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Oh, timing. So, we will be primarily shooting for about August of 2021. That may seem like a long time, but we're
committed to doing it right. Much work is already underway in terms of ecosystem selection. That's virtually all
done. We are moving into programming now. The programming takes several months, then you have a huge
amount of time of testing.
You could do it sooner, and we could beat that a little bit. But the key is to take plenty of time for testing, because
you only know through testing if you've done it right. And you don't want to put it out there and then go back and
have to change it. So, if I had to give you a specific date now, I'd give you like August of 2021.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then separately, Daryl, if you look at â€“ I guess, at slide 17 here, the outlook for the first quarter and the
full year, it implies relatively stable earning assets throughout the year. I mean, it sounds like there's some kind of
inflated assets at year-end and held for sale in the securities book that presumably will run off I would think
relatively quick. So, what I'm getting at is I'm trying to think about the loan growth that you're assuming for the rest
of the year or maybe along with those kind of inflated assets runoff in the first quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, Matt, what I would say is, I mean the trajectory of loans coming off of the books, mainly mortgages,
was down third, fourth quarter. We've bottomed out. Most of the trades have settled now, just a little bit left to go
this quarter. But when you look at point-to-point when we've presented to our board earlier this week our
operating plan on a go forward basis, we're looking to be a little bit better than growth in GDP.
So I would say in the 2% to 3% range point-to-point in loans over the next year, and favored a little bit heavier in
commercial versus retail. But I think we have, as Kelly said, momentum that we finished with the year fourth
quarter and the teams are working really well together and feel very positive that we're going to grow and
generate revenue as we move forward in 2020.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
On the slowing of the timing of the cost saves, of the factors that you said, what was the biggest driver? Because I
just assumed a lot of the drivers that you said like sort of focusing on service quality, the customer retention, the
digital, that's stuff that you would have already assumed that you would have been doing. So, what was the
change? What surprised you to make that change? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
So John, it's not really a surprise, but it is a difference. We were very committed to picking the best of the
systems. And so, we went system-by-system to look at the best and we picked a number of SunTrust systems
which are really, really good and surviving through a system. So, it's a little technical. But if you took all of the
BB&T systems, you can convert this much faster. You just move all of the data from SunTrust over to BB&T
programs. But when you pick the SunTrust system and you put it onto BB&T equipment, you have equipment
changes and you have the programming to move that SunTrust program over to the BB&T systems. That's really
what's driving the time a bit longer than we'd thought.
But it's also a conservative estimate with regard to testing, because we're committed to doing an awful lot of
testing. And then, remember, when we first talked about our timing, we did not anticipate the branch delay which
you alluded about, but that is the year of delayed savings. It was the right thing to do in conjunction with the
approval of the process. We feel good about it. We will be doing closings during the course of the year in non-
overlapping markets. We will be doing a lot of work through our retail channel in terms of preparing for the
closings. But that's a pretty material change in terms of the timing of the process.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay. That's helpful, Kelly. Thanks. And then separately, back to your 2020 outlook on slide 17, it looks like the
share count outlook isn't showing a change. So, is that implying that you're not assuming buybacks in 2020? And
if so, could you give us the rationale for that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Truist Financial Corp.
We basically said when we announced the merger, we're going to run at a 10% CET1 ratio until we got through
some of the integrations and took some of the risks off the table. So, we are starting off targeting 10%. When we
do our CCAR [ph] ask, our CCAR ask (00:45:33) that will be coming up in the next couple of months, we will build
in capacity such that if we decide to change that and decide to target something less than that after we have
some success, we'll have the ability to do that. But right now, we're sticking to 10%.

Operator: We'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Well, the delay in the branch closing is not really new. I guess, you just updated the numbers because you
said that like almost six months ago. So, I'm just trying to understand better the outlook for expenses. So, you
look to take the efficiency ratio from 57.5% down to what like 53% or 54% over three years, that implies a lot of
positive operating leverage.
So I guess the real question is, look, do you expect positive operating leverage in 2020? And as part of that, I
mean if you're delaying some of the branch closures and the deposit money conversions aren't until August 2021,
what are the expense savings that you can get more in the near term such as back-office or anything else?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
So, we are expecting positive operating leverage really for the next three years, so that's a really, really good
story. There are a lot of savings that we will get. Remember, again, the overlapping branches closings are
deferred. There are a number of branch closings that are not in overlapping areas that are going to be closed in
the near term. In addition to that, just because we don't close certain branches and overlapping years, it doesn't
mean we don't produce expenses in those areas. Some of these branches are literally side-by-side. And there are
commonalities in terms of staffing that we can integrate even though there are two separate branches. And so,
there will be cold space in the branches even before the branches are actually closed.
So, there are a lot of areas. To be honest, there's still a lot of backroom areas that are not related to the branches
that we have overlapping and staffing. We didn't deal with all of that day one. As time goes on, we will have
additional overlapping redundancy and staffing that we will be reducing. So, it's kind of a hodgepodge to be
honest. But it's pretty clear to see what we've laid out. We think with this modification in terms of the expected
timeframe with regard to saving, we feel very, very confident we'll be able to accomplish that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Truist Financial Corp.
Hey Mike, if you look on page 13 on the non-interest expense page that we have, the first five categories that you
have there, personnel all the way down to the equipment expense, I would expect those expense items to
decrease over the next three years. This year, personnel will drop. We did went through our first risks more on the
management level when we closed the transaction. Our sourcing group is working aggressively with our third-
party vendor supplier, so we will get savings in those areas.
And while not a lot of branches to date won't close this year. We're working very aggressively in all the major
markets, in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast, to really focus and consolidate our buildings in all the metropolitan
areas, and that should come online middle to end of 2020. So, we feel very good that we're going to get the cost
savings in 2020 and in the next three years.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And so, just maybe you don't want to answer the question, you're not giving that guidance. So when we go â€“ at
the year 2020, should revenue growth exceed expense growth, or is this really just all back-ended to years two
and three?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Truist Financial Corp.
I believe we're going to have positive operating leverage every year. We can't promise it every quarter because of
the seasonality, but every year we will generate positive operating leverage from 2019 to 2020, 2020 to 2021, and
2021 to 2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then, just a separate follow-up question. It sounds like you really are planning to have a strong long-
term company. You've said that you're taking a very measured approach. I guess, just maybe a little bit more from
Bill on the old SunTrust side. Kind of what are you seeing that's not going as well as you expected that you could
do better? And then, maybe Kelly you could chime in too.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Honestly, everything is going really well, and I don't have any area that I'd say is not going as well expected.
There are a lot of areas that are going much better. To be honest, the integration of our people and our teams,
whether it's our corporate and institutional group or our community bank, all of those are integrating extraordinarily
well. So, personally I see some real upside in terms of revenue momentum, particularly because of how well our
teams are working together.
I've had a chance to visit, Bill's had a chance to visit with a lot of our teams in the last 90 days especially. And
again, you walk around the room, you would not be able to detect that this was two companies just having come
together. You think they'd all been working together for a long time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Mike, I'd say, just â€“ we entered it in with some good momentum. Kelly outlined some good loan momentum
and legacy SunTrust coming into that. There was good loan momentum in BB&T as well. So, that's carrying over
into the early weeks of the year. On the investment banking side and the relationship and the teamwork that's
going on with the commercial community bank, it's just off the charts. I mean, I feel really good about that. I mean,
of course, we're one month in. But the things that you want to see in terms of pipelines and teamwork and all that,
I feel really good about. So, I think generally just strong momentum in the businesses heading into the merger.

Operator: Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask a bit about on the credit side. And Daryl, you mentioned that you're
going to redo the marks again. We're going through CECL. I assume that's in your provision guidance. Can you
help us understand when we moved to the PCD and non-PCD, within the 35 basis points to 50 basis points of
charge-offs, how much of legacy SunTrust charge-offs are we going to see in that number? And is there any room
where just the â€“ the math ends up looking better than the guidance just because of how the mechanics of the
charge-off recognition works with half the bookmarks?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. So Ken, what I would say is that our guidance between 35 basis points and 50 basis points, we believe we
can be within that range. And so, there's a little bit of uncertainty in the marketplace right now, so we widened the
range out a little bit. SunTrust portfolio is performing very well. We have good marks on it. We did sell a few
credits. Nothing of substance, but we did sell some that we wanted to just dispose of. But for the most part, their
credit profile is really strong as well. So, I wouldn't say there'd be any impact.
When we do convert from PCI to PCD, there will be about $200 million that will basically come out of the
purchase accounting mark and go into the allowance out of the $500 million that we have allocated to it. That's a
little bit of a nuance, but that's just how the CECL accounting plays out. I don't know if Clarke, you want to add
anything?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clarke R. Starnes A
Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. I don't see any big changes. Things look very stable right now in our guidance around the range. It depends
on the economy and also how fast some of our consumer segments grow. We've got a lot of attractive higher
margin consumer opportunities now between the two companies. So, it is really dependent upon the mix and the
economy. But as far as stability of asset quality right now and our outlook, it looks good.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And my follow up just on provision versus charge-offs on this point. You have the wider range of charge-
offs. But I guess, is it fair to say that the provision pretty much matches if you just look at your full-year guidance
versus what the charge-offs guide implies for losses? Just the moving parts between provision and charge-offs,
that'd be helpful. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Truist Financial Corp.
So, I'll start and Clarke can chip in. But in essence, our provision estimate is assuming charge-offs and then all of
our assumptions within CECL. As you heard from all of our peers, the models are more complex now, so you
have to look at the market environment, quiet behavior. There's a lot more variables that you have here. We're
18


Truist Financial Corp.
(TFC) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2019 Earnings Call 30-Jan-2020
assuming all that is static. We're assuming we're going to grow the portfolio. And our assumption is, is that mix
stays the same. Obviously, all that is not going to be static like that, but that's what's built into the assumption.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clarke R. Starnes A
Chief Risk Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Ken, the way I think about it is, we're going to incrementally provide above charge-offs generally at the
reserve rate, assuming no big change in our seasonal assumptions. So, you'd assume the provisions larger than
charge-offs.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
My first question is on synergies once again. So, very strong statement and positive operating leverage over the
next three years. I'm wondering if that includes any revenue synergies, and how should we think about revenue
synergies going forward? The organic growth in insurance is particularly impressive, given that the company was
combined for only 24 days clearly that didn't have any impact. So, I wanted to understand what the revenue
opportunities for the combined company are? And also the other question on that on the cost side, Daryl, could
you tell us about the pacing during the year in 2020 and 2021 of the cost savings realization, please?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
So Erika, we feel â€“ and Bill alluded to this, we feel very, very good about the revenue synergies. I mean, really
you've got to remind yourself of how synergistic this combination is. I mean, SunTrust has a fantastic, corporate,
institutional group program, fantastic wealth management strategies, fantastic National Consumer Finance
business. All of which are complementary, can be leveraged over BB&T or client base.
Likewise, you alluded to the insurance opportunity from BB&T side, and the BB&T community bank has a broader
reach than the SunTrust community bank reach has. So they'll be able to expand some of the programs that the
BB&T community bank had into the SunTrust Bank. So, all of that which is of course not factored into our
19

numbers, is net very positive and accretive. We can't give you numbers on that today, because it's hard to really
give you meaningfully accurate numbers. But intuitively from talking to our people, we know that all of those
businesses are very synergistic, have huge opportunity, and early response from our people in terms of executing
on that is outstanding. Now, insurance you talked about is real and very easy to kind of talk about. So, let's ask
Chris to talk about that in a minute.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher L. Henson A
Head of Banking and Insurance, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Erika, I might just also mention to play off of both Bill and Kelly's comments on the community bank and the
CIB working together. Just a couple of tangible thoughts. When both companies and I sat down to actually design
the model, we actually designed in the community bank â€“ embedded in the community bank about 200 folks that
are capital markets industry specialists, corporate finance specialists. Their sole purpose in life is to integrate with
the regional presence, a 24 of those, to share the client base of BB&T with those individuals.
And we have, for example, just since December 9, seven deals that would be sizeable enough that would get
your attention, that we have been involved in with the client and we have commitments on three of those. Now,
seven deals doesn't make a future, but seven deals in about 45 days of that nature I think is pretty good. Both
teams, I can tell you from having sat in the regional presidents' meetings, are exceptionally excited and it's a
natural gravitation. And I'll just â€“ I'll leave it at that, but it's been very, very effective.
To Kelly's point on the insurance side, two years ago we really said we want to transform this business and we
brought in a consultant really to kind of transform start-up with a white sheet of paper. I could not be more proud
of what those guys have executed. Now, we've set up 32 initiatives. We're on plan. We're on our target to improve
the EBITDA. Just in two years, for example, we've increased our margin 6% and we've got industry-leading
organic growth year-to-date.
And I will tell you the three things you want in place are in place. We've got industry-leading retention. We've got
pricings coming our way, and it's up 5%, another 0.5% this quarter versus third. And our new business production
which is actually feet on the streets generating business is up 13% and not in my career have I seen 13%. So, all
things go in the insurance brokerage business.

The follow-up question. Yeah. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. I would just tell you, it's hard to call it on a quarter-by-quarter basis. We're trying to give you target
estimates what we would be at the end of each year. Probably what I would just stay with right now, we're only
eight weeks into the merger. We'll have more clarity. We'll close the first full-month books next week. So give us
another quarter or two, and we'll have more certainty down the road. But I think we gave you good enough
estimates and feel very confident we're going to get the cost saves.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. And just as a follow up. I just wanted to make sure I understood how we should treat the purchase
accounting over the three years. So you mentioned that 60% of the $4.5 billion is credit and 40% is liquidity. And I
guess, the way I just understood the credit part of the mark is the not accretable difference which would not
accrete on over NII. And I just wanted to make sure I was thinking about it the right way or does all of the $4.5
billion accrete back to NII?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, the nuance, I mentioned this earlier, I'm glad you called this out. So, out of the $4.5 billion, now that
we've adopted CECL, about $200 million of it is going to go into the reserve. It's part of CECL, so it's in there now.
So, it's in essence having $4.3 billion will accrete in as principal and cash flows come in from the assets and then
the liabilities that you have over those terms.

Brian Klock Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Daryl, I just have a quick follow up. I just want to make sure that I understand the comments on the CET1 10%
target and buybacks. So even though the CET1 came in at 9.4% which was a little bit lower end versus what you
21

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 30-Jan-2020
guys initially thought, the accretable yield that's coming through is coming in pretty fast. So, does it feel like your
timing with the CCAR submission that you guys would probably be able to buy back stock in the second half of
the year, does that still sound like that's on target?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Truist Financial Corp.
So Brian, yeah, we did give guidance that this next quarter because of the MSR change and RWA and then the
CECL adoption, our first quarter ending CET1 ratio will probably be relatively flat to what we have right now in the
9.4% range. After that, I agree with you, we'll start to build pretty quickly as we generate and accrete through the
earnings power there. It's really a call on Kelly and Bill's part and the board's part on when we start buyback.
Right now, we're just sticking with the 10%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Klock Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. [ph] Thank you. (01:03:00)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. So remember, we've said very clearly that over the term, some of these things settle down, there is capital
opportunity with regard to Truist. We've also said very clearly that during the first phase of our new Truist life, it's
really smart to be conservative. I mean, we have a lot of moving parts that need to settle down. We have a lot of
existential factors out in the world, but we'd know about that right now with what's breaking from a medical point of
view. So, there's just a lot of sound reasoning in terms of being conservative.
Now, as those uncertainties settle down, to your point, in terms of the capital level we have, in terms of the capital
accretion that will occur predictably over the next several quarters, there certainly could be the opportunity of
some capital buybacks. I wouldn't be surprised at all if that were to happen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Klock Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
That's helpful. Thank you. Appreciate it. And Daryl, just one real quick follow up. When I look at slide 17 on the
guidance for merger expenses for the full year, the $600 million to $700 million. The footnote doesn't include
some of the incremental operating expenses related to the merger. I guess, how much is in that $600 million to
$700 million related to these incremental operating expenses? And can you just remind us what that means in
light of the differentiation between the incremental operating and the other restructuring and merger charges?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, Brian. So if you remember at [ph] BAB (01:04:28), I went through in detail the difference between what are
normal merger and restructuring charges versus this incremental operating. The main primary difference is, our
definition of merger and restructuring basically has no future benefit. It's due just to the transaction. Because of
the size of this transaction and the magnitude, there are a lot of things that we are doing that â€“ putting things
together that will have some benefit.
So, like in Scott's area when we're putting the systems together that he is working on in integration and the
ecosystems, a design around putting those ecosystems together. Well, it has a future benefit. We're doing lots of
that, hundreds of millions of dollars of people working on that architecture that we're putting those and calling
22

those out. For the most part, we have schedules in our tables that break out where to pull those numbers out, but
for the most part it's in personnel and professional are were most of those charges exist. As far as the breakdown
goes, it's a high level estimate. I would say, about a third of it might be related to the MOE and the operating, the
rest would probably be [ph] MERCs, (01:05:41) is a ballpark here.

Operator: Our next question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Hi, guys. A couple of quick follow-ups. I guess just on the CET1. Daryl, if you don't do buybacks this year with the
share count that you've guided to, does that get you back up to the 10% in your modeling by the end of the year?
Are you roughly at 10% or does it take you into 2021 to get back to that 10%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Truist Financial Corp.
Our estimates right now, we are plus or minus 10% towards the end of the year. It all depends on how fast the
balance sheet grows and how the accretion comes in, so there's a lot of variables there, but we're in the
neighborhood of 10%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. And just a follow-up on Saul's question. The purchase accounting is a nice boost for this year. It seems like
the difference between the core and non-core margin suggests something like $1.5 billion or so of purchase
accounting addition to NII this year. Does that fall off quickly next year? Does that like drop by 20% or just any
idea of the pace that that kind of scales down? I know you've got the merger saves that'll kick in to offset it. But
what's the â€“ any idea on the pace of that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. We gave you the terms of try to how you would amortize it in. It does fade away over the several year
process. So, I think you have the right mindset of how to model it. Just know that, as you model it and you factor
in the cost saves, you will see that you still drive positive operating leverage.

John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Right. Right. Okay. Last question. On the page 18, the investment â€“ the annualized 4Q 2020 investment of $200
million, what are you guys including in that and how are you characterizing? Like what kind of investments and
why are you calling that out? Just give us some color on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Truist Financial Corp.
I'll give a couple. So, our executive leadership team approved about more than doubling our digital teams that are
out work now and they're assigned to all the different business units working to making our improvements and
enhancements for our client experience, so that would be one.
In personnel, there are some key hires that we're putting out into the marketplace and more teams that have
some skillsets that we don't have that we're trying to get more of. We're starting to see some branding in Dante's
World marketing going back and forth. So, I don't know if anybody else wants to...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
The big one of those is the development of our innovation and technological center. That has got a lot of
excitement, a lot of focus, and pretty immediate investment in. So, that will be a big development during this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Henry Rogers A
President, Chief Operating Officer & Director, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Thanks. I'll add on there, commercial onboarding. I mean, it's a list of dozens of things that we're seeing
that are â€“ we've got the capacity to do them. They're not opportunistic. They're really client-friendly, client-
focused. And we're calling it out because these are strategic investments that we think making now are going to
really have an incredibly good long-term payback. And deferring them for the point of meeting some quarter just
doesn't make a lot of sense. So, that's the reason to put them in there and call them out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. All right. Thanks, Bill. That's helpful. So, when you guys talk about the merger stays at $1.6 billion net,
that's the kind of investments that you're netting against that; the merger saves.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
That's right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Truist Financial Corp.
And I wouldn't expect the investments to stop at $200 million.

Lana Chan Q
Analyst, BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Hi. Good morning.

Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lana Chan Q
Analyst, BMO Capital Markets (United States)
So, one quick question on the preferreds dividend in the fourth quarter. Was there something unusual there and
can you give us run rate for the quarters in 2020?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, Lana. We have a couple preferreds that are semi-annual rather than quarterly. I think that's the nuance that
you have to factor in now when you look at the Truist dividend payout schedule.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lana Chan Q
Analyst, BMO Capital Markets (United States)
But there was only $19 million which was much lower than even, I think, the previous run rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Truist Financial Corp.
You remember though, in the BB&T world we retired one preferred and then we reissued another preferred. I
think the timing of all that basically had a favorable impact in the fourth quarter. It should level out as we get into
2020 from a schedule. But do you want to talk about this offline, I'm sure myself or Rich or Aaron can handle that
question for you.

Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, just I wanted to confirm, Daryl, that you've said before on the core run rate for
the expenses through 2020 by the time we get to the fourth quarter with the cost savings that we should see a
decline in the quarterly run rate through the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, we gave you â€“ if you make all the adjustments, baseline for 2019 is $12.8 billion. We hear saying that
our net cost savings for the fourth quarter of 2020 would be down to $120 million, which is annualized $480
million run rate number which is 30% and it will continue to build year-after-year on that.

Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Scouten with Piper Sandler.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hi. Good morning, guys. Not to be the dead horse here, but kind of thinking about the delayed expense savings.
I'm just wondering, if I calculate that, it seems like the [indiscernible] (01:11:57) timing is about $0.20 a year in
2020 and 2021. I'm wondering if there's any offsets that you've seen in terms of upside surprises from any sort of
revenue realizations or otherwise as you've gotten into the deal so far.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, Stephen, as you know, we didn't factor in intentionally any of the revenue opportunities in this. What you're
seeing now is kind of the worst case in terms of the expense delay with no factored in revenue opportunities. But
as you just heard Chris and Bill say, the revenue opportunities in commercial banking and private banking and
insurance across the board are really very, very substantial. And it's not something that will take like two years to
get underway, it's underway as we speak.
So, it's a very conservative view to factor in the expense delay without factoring in the revenue enhancements.
But that's our nature. We try to be conservative, so we'd rather beat than miss. And so, that's kind of the way
we've tried to factor together.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. And then other question for me is just, in terms of restructuring business units, loan runoff and things
of that nature, is everything in your mind that's been completed here already are in the process of what's
26


Truist Financial Corp.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 30-Jan-2020
remaining and held for sale? Or are there still other decisions to be made about additional business line exits
potentially or other loans that you might look to take off the balance sheet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl N. Bible A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah. Stephen, well, I would say, for the most part we're pretty much over with from a balance sheet restructuring
perspective. Everything will settle that we wanted to move off this quarter and move forward from that
perspective. We still have our divestiture that's planned later in the year, probably second quarter. So, that will
come out of run rate when that occurs. But I think for the most part, we have pretty much everything done.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Great. Thanks so much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: And we'll take our final question from Christopher Marinac with Janney Montgomery Scott.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Thanks. I want to ask about compensation for the combined companies in terms of just retaining employees that
you have. Is there anything unique that you are doing or that you intend to do just to keep competitors at bay and
keep your team focused?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly S. King A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Truist Financial Corp.
Yeah, Chris. We've been working on that from day one in terms of special compensation arrangements for key
players and developing a very aggressive ongoing compensation program for all of our people, whether in staff
jobs or in revenue jobs. I mean, for example, we did a $1,500 bonus for like 48,000 of our teammates that we just
paid out in the last few months just as a thank you for their hard work. And so, yeah, we've done a lot of particular
activities to try to focus on that.
And so, that's one of the reasons we feel very, very confident in terms of our low attrition. And, in fact, what we're
seeing is low attrition. So everybody feels good. We've done all the right things and we will remain aggressive in
terms of taking care of our teammates, because ultimately the way it emerges well or not is based on the
teammates. And again, all of our teammates today feel very, very good, very, very excited and very confident.
And again, I'll say again the attrition is very, very low. So, we feel very good.
