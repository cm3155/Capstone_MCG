Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Louise. Hello everyone. Thank you for joining today. I'm here with Jon Bingham, our Group Financial
Controller who's acting as Interim Group Chief Financial Officer.
We delivered another good quarter, which shows that our strategy is working and we have a strong platform for
growth. I am committed to building on that. Before Jon takes you through the third quarter numbers, I'd like to
make a few comments.
We made several announcements last week. First, Pam Kaur will take over as Group Chief Financial Officer with
effect from 1st of January. Pam is an exceptional leader who joined HSBC in 2013 as Group Head of Audit, and is
currently our Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer. With almost 40 years' experience in the financial sector,
she brings a global perspective to the strategic challenges and opportunities we face today. I look forward to

partnering with her for the next stage of the bank's growth and development. I would also like to thank Jon for his
outstanding support during the interim period.
Second, we announced a reorganization to simplify and streamline the group. We're currently organized around
three businesses in five regions. From the 1st of January, we will operate through four businesses. Hong Kong
and the UK, serving Personal Banking and Commercial Banking customers in our two home markets; Corporate
and Institutional Banking; and International Wealth and Premier Banking.
We will also streamline our geographic governance structures, reducing them from five regions to two, further
enhancing our ability to serve our customers' needs throughout our global network. Our current Group Executive
Committee of 18 members will be replaced by a new Group Operating Committee with 12 members. The analysis
we've done so far demonstrates that the reorganization will result in net cost savings with a relatively short
payback period on any upfront costs. We will share these details with you at our full-year results in February, as
part of a wider business update.
And third, turning to the external environment, I welcome the clarity provided by the UK government on its
prudential rules. The PRA's second near final policy statement and rules on the implementation of Basel 3.1 bring
an end to years of uncertainty, and will help the banking sector to support growth in the UK. Similarly, I am
encouraged by the recent policy measures in mainland China and in Hong Kong.
I'm confident that the monetary stimulus announced last month, and potential further fiscal and other measures,
will help to stabilize key sectors and strengthen mainland China's economy. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's easing of
macro-prudential constraints is proportionate and timely, and we expect these measures to have a positive impact
on the Hong Kong economy.
With that, Jon will take you through the Q3 numbers. Jon?

Thanks, George. In summary, we had another good quarter. Profit before tax of $8.5 billion was up $0.9 billion or
11% on the third quarter of last year on a constant currency basis. This brings our annualized return on tangible
equity for the first nine months of the year to 19.3%, or 16.7% excluding notable items.
Revenue of $17 billion was up $1.1 billion on last year's third quarter, and up $0.3 billion on the second quarter
this year, underlying the good momentum within the business. We've announced today a further $4.8 billion of
distributions, consisting of a third interim dividend of $0.10 per share and a new share buyback of up to $3 billion.
We intend to complete this buyback during the four-month period before our full-year results announcement in
February. Last week, we also completed the share buyback announcement at the half-year results in July. We've
now repurchased 9% of our share count since the start of last year.
As you can see on the next slide, strategic transactions, principally the disposal of Canada in the first quarter,
were a small impact on the year-on-year revenue and profit growth. Excluding this impact of these transactions,
profit before tax, excluding notable items, was up 13% on the third quarter of last year.
Revenue of $17 billion was up $1.1 billion on the third quarter of last year, driven by a $1.6 billion increase in fee
and other income. This included a $0.7 billion increase in Wholesale Transaction Banking and Wealth. The
remaining $1 billion increase primarily reflected strong performance in Equities and Global Debt Markets with
3

Global Banking and Markets. And adverse items in the third quarter of last year that did not repeat, including $0.3
billion of Treasury disposal losses and other notable items.
Banking NII of $10.6 billion was down $0.3 billion on the second quarter on a reported FX basis, primarily due to a
loss arising from the early redemption of legacy securities. Excluding this, the banking NII run rate was stable on
the previous quarter.
Our 2024 banking NII guidance is unchanged at around $43 billion. Our guidance includes the impact of the $0.3
billion early redemption loss taken this quarter. It also assumes a $1 billion contribution from Argentina this year,
which is what we reported in 2023. Argentina has contributed $1.2 billion to banking NII in the year-to-date, but
the volatility created by hyperinflation accounting makes that number very difficult to forecast from quarter to
quarter. Accordingly, I would encourage you to think of our guidance as being around $42 billion, excluding
Argentina.
Turning to fee and other income. Wholesale Transaction Banking was up 7% on last year's third quarter. The key
driver was global foreign exchange, which grew 12%, benefiting from an increased client activity. Higher volumes
also contributed to growth in both Global Trade Solutions and Global Payments Solutions.
Wealth was up 32% on the third quarter last year. It was our third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in
Wealth, as our continued investments in this business and the importance of Hong Kong as a global wealth hub
have enabled us to capitalize on a favorable operating environment. There was double-digit growth in all Wealth
products, but life insurance was the biggest driver. About half of the growth in life insurance was from the non-
repetition of a charge we took in Q3 last year. Excluding that, life insurance still grew well into double digits,
mainly because a higher CSM balance drove an increase in CSM release.
The CSM balance is a store of value. All else remaining equal, growth in the balance means growth in future
earnings. And our CSM balance continue to grow. In the first three quarters of this year, we've generated more
than $2 billion of new business CSM. This has driven our CSM balance to $13.2 billion, a 22% increase since last
year's third quarter, creating a foundation for future revenue growth.
Hong Kong continue to benefit from inflows of international customers. There were 243,000 new-to-bank
customers in the third quarter versus an average of just over 170,000 per quarter in the first half. Net new
invested assets were $26 billion in the quarter, $11 billion of which were in Asia.
On credit, you'll recall that our second quarter had a low ECL charge due to recoveries and other items. The third
quarter ECL charge was $1 billion or 40 basis points of average loans. The wholesale ECL charge was $0.6
billion, driven by $0.4 billion in Hong Kong, of which $0.1 billion related to Hong Kong commercial real estate,
whilst the personal charge was $0.4 billion. This brings our annualized ECL charge to 28 basis points of average
loans for the year-to-date, which is broadly in line with our 30 to 40 basis point guidance for the full year.
Next on costs. Costs were up 6% in the first nine months of the year on a target basis, which was 1% lower than
for the first half. As we explained in the previous quarter, the phasing of performance-related pay and the
additional levies from the end of last year will give us a tailwind heading into the fourth quarter. We're on track to
meet our target of around 5% cost growth for 2024 on a target basis and remain committed to cost discipline.
On lending and deposits, loan balances were stable in the third quarter. Deposits were up 1%, driven by a $16
billion increase in Hong Kong WPB. This reflected short-term flows between invested assets and deposits, and I'd
4

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2024
caution you against annualizing that number. Term deposits were 39% of total Hong Kong deposits, unchanged
since the second quarter.
Next, our CET1 ratio was 15.2%, up 20 basis points on the second quarter, as strong organic capital generation
was partly offset by distributions. CET1 grew $3.1 billion during the quarter on a constant currency basis. This
growth included $2.9 billion of other movements, mainly gains in the market value of securities classified as held-
to-collect-and-sell, which are fair valued through other comprehensive income. RWAs grew by $14 billion on a
constant currency basis, mainly due to broader balance sheet growth.
Finally, I'd like to point out a number of upcoming events which will help you with your modeling. First, we expect
the buyback we announced today to have an impact of around 0.4 percentage points on our CET1 ratio in the
fourth quarter. It remains our intention to return excess capital to shareholders through a rolling series of share
buybacks.
Secondly, we expect to complete the sale of HSBC Argentina in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, around $5.1
billion of historical foreign exchange translation and other reserve losses will be recycled to the income statement
on completion. This has already been recognized in capital, and there will be no incremental impact on CET1,
TNAV or distributions. These losses will also be excluded from our dividend calculation. We expect the
completion of the sale to reduce RWAs by around $8 billion, equivalent to around 0.1 percentage points of CET1.
Third, we intend to begin to actively market our $8 billion legacy French home loan portfolio during the fourth
quarter. We expect to reclassify this portfolio as held-to-collect-and-sell in the first quarter next year, leading to a
recognition of an estimated $1 billion pre-tax loss equivalent to around 0.1 percentage points of CET1.
Finally, the PRA recently published near final rules on Basel 3.1. These are incrementally better than we
previously expected. We continue to expect them to have an immaterial impact on our CET1 ratio upon
implementation.
To conclude, our guidance remains unchanged. Namely, a mid-teens return on tangible equity, excluding notable
items, for 2024 and 2025. Banking NII of around $43 billion in 2024. ECLs for the full year within our normal
medium-term planning range of 30 to 40 basis points. Cost growth of around 5% for 2024 on a target basis. And
mid-single-digit loan growth over the medium term.
With that, Louise, can we hand over to Q&A?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, Jon. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Andrew Coombs at
Citigroup. Please accept the prompt to unmute your line.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Hello, Andrew.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Coombs Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
Good morning, and good afternoon for those in Hong Kong. Two questions, please. One, firstly, just on the reorg
and strategy. A very simple question given the new structure, where does that leave Mexico? So, any thoughts on
Mexico would be appreciated.
And, secondly, on the financials themselves, on that non-NII strength, where fees and other income were up 32%
year-on-year, and you've highlighted you now had three consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. And
previously, if I go back to your Investor Day in 2023, you took that high-single-digit growth for Asian Wealth
specifically. You're clearly running well ahead of that and consistently running well ahead of that. So, to what
extent do you think we can extrapolate that double-digit growth into future quarters in next year? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Andrew. I'm going to take your first question about Mexico, and Jon will address the second one. So,
Andrew, we have a good market position in Mexico. We have a good performance in Mexico. Our wholesale
business in Mexico is in a particular strength in our global network of connectivity. It's very strongly connected
with our North American business. It's equally very strongly connected with our Asia-Pacific business and,
therefore, is a key strategic anchor stone for our customers.
Our retail business in Mexico will form part of the new business segment of International Wealth and Personal
Banking. As you know, all our Personal Banking businesses outside the Hong Kong and UK, our two home
markets, will be part of the International Wealth and Premier Banking business, which will be focused on growing
the affluent segment in the market and creating a strategic differentiation for us in the market where we operate in
the Personal Banking space outside home markets. Jon will take the second question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan Bingham A
Interim Group Chief Financial Officer & Global Financial Controller, HSBC Holdings Plc
Andrew, as you know, we've been investing in our Wealth capabilities for some time. Wealth was up 32% year-
on-year in third quarter and 20% year-on-year for the nine months. That growth was particularly driven in Asia,
where we see a favorable operating environment, but we are seeing broad-based growth across the main
segments. That's supported by strong customer growth and growth in net new invested assets. So, we have
guided previously to high-single-digit growth. I think it's fair that we may well outperform that in the short term.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Aman Rakkar at Barclays. Please accept the prompt to

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aman Rakkar Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
Good morning, and good afternoon. Thanks very much for the presentation and the questions. Yeah, I had a
question on – one on restructuring and one on net interest income, please. Just trying to scope the degree of
ambition that you might have around restructuring. It looks like efforts to restructure the business are focused on
delivering net cost saves. You're clearly doing very well on revenues at the moment, particularly the fee business
is presumably a source of near-term upside to market expectations.
But I think the outlook is volatile. A lot of these things are outside of your area of control. So, what is the scale of
the ambition around what you'd be looking to achieve on things like costs and indeed RWAs, as you try and kind
of future-proof the medium-term return on tangible equity outlook?
And then I had a second question on net interest income. So, I think the – I'm taking the kind of banking NII guide
at face value and trying to nix out Argentina. And I think it's implying a kind of annualized run rate of around $41.5
billion at the fourth quarter as a jumping-off point into 2025.
Maybe a bit of a low value question, but interested if you were able to, at this stage, just to comment on banking
net interest income as per consensus in 2025. I think the Street's at around $41 billion, so versus that $41.5
billion. Not looking for too much attrition from here. It'd be great to get – if you're not willing to put a number on it,
well, how you see the moving parts out there, please. Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Aman, for the two questions. Again, I'm going to address your first question on the reorganization, and
Jon can take us through the NII elements. So, Aman, the primary reason for the reorganization is to create a
simpler, more dynamic, more agile, leaner bank. It's really to allow us to empower our front-line staff, and make it
faster to make decisions and ultimately serve our customers better. That's the primary reason.
Now, as a result of a simpler, leaner, more efficient bank, there will be cost saves. The costs takeout will be
essentially in the form of severance or related cost. It will be affecting senior roles that will be de-duplicated or the
reduction of the number of senior roles will drive this. We will be giving you those details about – the figures about
the upfront costs as well as the benefits realization in the full-year results in February.
What I can say is, number one, the benefits will exceed the upfront costs and the payback is going to happen in a
short timeframe thereafter. And then the second point to share with you is that we remain fully committed to cost
discipline. I've been sharing this in my days as Group CFO. I carry on this mission of being fully committed to cost
discipline, and this is now embedded in the firm, as you have seen from our Q3 results. For 2024, we remain on
track to deliver on our cost target. We are committed to it. And we're confident we will be able to achieve it. Jon?

Jonathan Bingham A
Interim Group Chief Financial Officer & Global Financial Controller, HSBC Holdings Plc
So, on banking NII, thanks for the question, Aman, if I might be forgiven for giving you a slightly longer answer to
those. So, if we start on 2024, we've reiterated our guidance on 2024 of banking NII of around $43 billion, but
encourage you to think about that as $42 billion ex-Argentina. In total, we've printed $31.6 billion for the nine
months to date, and we think the Q3 run rate of $10.6 billion is a pretty clean run rate for you to think about
modeling 2025.
We don't provide guidance at this stage on 2025 banking NII guidance. But if you take that clean run rate of the
$10.6 billion, which I agree just about $42 billion, we'll have disposed of Argentina. So, therefore, we then think of
the building blocks for you to model this along four factors.
Firstly, rates. The reduction in rates implied in markets will be clearly a headwind. The cuts during the third
quarter, given the timing [ph] of there then (22:17), they had a relatively modest impact on the third quarter's
results. But we'd encourage you to use our banking NII sensitivity against market implied rates to generate that
component.
We then have the structural hedge that will provide a tailwind. We've got the reinvestment of maturing positions
that will enable us to reinvest them at higher rates. We've signaled that for 2025, we've got $115 billion maturing
at an average yield of about 2.9%. So, think about those maturing and being placed at something along the lines
of five-year bond rates.
We then got volume growth. Whilst volume growth has been relatively subdued in 2024, we do hope that with
interest rates coming off and economic activity picking up, that we will see more loan growth. We continue to
guide to mid-single digits in the medium to long term. The timing of getting there will be unpredictable.
And then lastly, we keep an eye on time deposit migration. That has been relatively stable, particularly in Hong
Kong at 39% over the last couple of quarters. But the impact on that as rates come off will be variable. It depends
on competitive pressures and customer behavior. So, all of those factors is how we have thought about it and
modeled it, and included that within our mid-teens RoTE guidance for 2025.
Thanks, Aman.

Thank you, Aman.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aman Rakkar Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
Thank you. Could I have just one follow-up? And thanks very much for that really detailed answer. In relation to
the mid-teens RoTE aspiration next year, does that include or exclude any potential kind of upfront costs as part
of any restructuring?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan Bingham A
Interim Group Chief Financial Officer & Global Financial Controller, HSBC Holdings Plc
So, the mid-teens RoTE guidance is excluding notable items. We will come back to you in February with full
details of the benefits and costs of the reorganization.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Invine Q
Analyst, Redburn (Europe) Ltd.
Hi. Good morning to you both or good evening. I've got two, please. The first is on the Wealth business. So,
clearly, just some really good revenue numbers. I was just wondering if you could kind of explain the slight
disconnect with the net new invested asset number in Asia, which certainly was positive, but probably not quite as
positive as I might have expected given how good the revenue line was.
And then second, could you just share your thoughts about the outlook for corporate loan growth across Asia, so
– and, in fact, loan growth more generally across Asia? So, I think in the second quarter, we saw both Hong Kong
and kind of ex-Hong Kong fall slightly, but I think three months ago, Noel was sounding a bit more positive, at
least on Hong Kong. Also, we've had the announcements in China about a month ago. So, just where do we go
from here on the Asia loan volumes?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, James. I'm going to share some thoughts on your two questions and I'll ask Jon to go into more
details about both of them. First, our Wealth business, as you've seen in this quarter's exhibited double-digit
returns, this is the third quarter in a row with similar type returns. Wealth business, as you know, is generated
from four segments, one of which has performed quite well, which is the trading activities of our customers. And
that manifests both in the private bank as well as in our invested assets. They have been very strong and they've
been even stronger following the measures we've seen in China.
On the outlook for corporate loan growth in Asia, as I shared earlier, we are very encouraged by the policy
measures that have taken place, both in mainland China as well as in Hong Kong. We see these measures,
combined with the outlook on rates coming down, as supportive of future growth specifically in our Hong Kong
book. And outside Hong Kong, the rest of Asia remains resilient. Southeast Asia and South Asia remain quite
strong in terms of loan growth, although, of course, a different size in our books than Hong Kong. Jon?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan Bingham A
Interim Group Chief Financial Officer & Global Financial Controller, HSBC Holdings Plc
So, just to amplify your comments on Wealth. So, we've seen good growth in Wealth. We see the net new
invested assets. We're very pleased with that. In Asia, they've grown by $11 billion in the quarter and $49 billion
over the nine months. You will see some movements as we grow our Wealth franchise. We also had $16 billion of
deposits, which George talked about. We'll see also deposits increase. They will ultimately feed into the Wealth
share of wallets that we've gotten. So, continue to be encouraged.

Kunpeng Ma Q
Analyst, China Securities Co., Ltd
Hey, good morning, George. Good morning, Jon. This is Kunpeng with China Securities. Thank you for taking my
question. I got one question on Transaction Banking. Because we have seen a slight recovery in the Transaction
Banking income in the third quarter, but I think that's maybe driven by the FX volatilities.
But going forward, maybe we can see more rate cuts going forward, and we can – maybe we're going to see
continued FX volatilities going forward. So, could you please give me a little bit more color on the future outlook of
the Transaction Banking income? If you could comment on both NII and non-NII, that's going to be quite
appreciated. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Kunpeng. I'll ask Jon to comment on this area where, as you've heard us saying, an area of strategic
differentiation for us, for our wholesale customers, and where we keep investing and do expect continued growth
in the space given our investments and our leadership in this space. Jon?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan Bingham A
Interim Group Chief Financial Officer & Global Financial Controller, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So, we've been pleased by the growth in Wholesale Transaction Banking in the quarter, up 7%. As you
say, an element of that is client-driven activity around FX and rates volatility. But within that, we continue to invest
in Global Trade Solutions and Global Payments. On Global Trade Solutions, we continue to grow our market
share in both Hong Kong and the UK. And so, as that market comes back, there is the opportunity for us to that
be a platform for our growth. Similarly, you'll see us to continue to invest in Global Payments Solutions, and we
see a very optimistic path for the payment markets going forward. Thank you.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2024
Amit Goel Q
Analyst, Mediobanca SpA (United Kingdom)
Hi. Thank you. Two questions from me. One, just coming back on the simplification program. Just curious, I guess
in the past, the group hasn't opted to combine Commercial Banking and GBM. So, just curious what's kind of
seen as different now, which makes this more feasible and easy to execute with less maybe revenue attrition [ph]
or up for (30:25) consideration.
And then secondly, just on the ECL charges, those were a little bit higher than what I anticipated. It looks like a bit
of that's from Hong Kong wholesale and the UK ring-fenced bank. So, just curious if there's any kind of additional
color you can provide on that and how you're thinking about the kind of 40 bps in the context of the guidance into
next year. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Amit. Let me address your first question, and Jon can address the ECL charges question. So, the
primary reason of this reorganization is to simplify the bank as we shared. But we have been on a multiyear
journey to simplify the activities we do in the bank. We've been exiting activities that were non-strategic. We've
been reshaping our portfolio. We've exited markets or activities. Currently, we're on track to complete the sale of
our Argentina business and our Armenia business, and announced two additional exits in September, including
South Africa as well as the private bank in Germany.
Now, that activity was addressing the what in terms of what we do as a strategy. The reorganization we have
announced last week is basically addressing the how we execute our strategy. It's not changing the what, it's
changing the how. And the reason we could effectively execute the how we change our strategy as in be simpler,
more agile is because of the work we have done over the past few years in simplifying the what we do. So, there
is a – it is the right time now to address how we operate – how we execute our strategy, because we've simplified
what we do, we've clarified what our core strategic areas for us, where we have competitive strength and where
we have leadership and opportunities to grow.
So, the timing, therefore, is a natural kind of conclusion of the various activities that we have been taking through
the transformation over the last five years. I want to say that outside the UK and Hong Kong, where we're merging
all our Commercial Banking activities with Global Banking and Markets activities to form the Corporate and
Institutional Bank. It will comprise our core products, including our balance sheet-related products, Credit and
Lending, and Deposits, our Transaction Banking products, as well as our other products such as Investment
Banking or Markets. And this should give our customers a more seamless way to deal with HSBC across all this
product spectrum that we offer them. Jon?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan Bingham A
Interim Group Chief Financial Officer & Global Financial Controller, HSBC Holdings Plc
So, thanks, Amit. I'll give you a bit more color on the ECL charges. A $1 billion charge in third quarter, which is 40
basis points of average loans. That's actually a more normal charge, because Q2 benefited from releases and
recoveries. If you then dissect the third quarter charge, there's three things within there. So, firstly, the UK, which
is $0.2 billion charge. Again, that benefited from the release it releases in the second quarter. It's a more normal
charge. There's nothing more going on in there.
11


HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2024 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2024
Hong Kong, in total, we incurred a $0.5 billion charge. As you say, that was mainly $0.4 billion charge in
wholesale, which included $0.1 billion of mainland China CRE and $0.1 billion of Hong Kong CRE. The rest of it
was across a number of sectors. Again, nothing of particular note.
And then relative to third quarter last year, we did have an increase in our Mexico retail charge. So, that went up
to $0.2 billion charge. That's actually been relatively normal through the quarters of 2024, but relative to third
quarter 2023 is a little higher. So, we're confident as we see this that we will be in our 30 to 40 basis points
planning range over the medium term and certainly there for 2024.

Gurpreet Singh Sahi Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC
Thank you for taking my question, and congratulations on a good set of numbers. I have two and mostly follow-
ups. First is on Wealth and then we'll move to Hong Kong CRE. On Wealth, can I check with the so-called policy
rescue in China? Only a month old, and for this reporting quarter, maybe only a week. So, have we seen like,
from August as we transitioned into September, good wealth management income traction better than what we
are reporting in the third quarter? And then in October, that continued, maybe it even accelerated. So, some color
there would be helpful.
And then on Hong Kong CRE specifically, not talking about Hong Kong in general, can we get numbers on the
NPL ratio within the overall global CRE book and also the Hong Kong CRE book? As at the half year, we were at
9% Stage 3 loans in both. Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Gurpreet. Let me just briefly address Wealth, and I'll ask Jon to complement it and address your Hong
Kong CRE question. So, there are two trends in Wealth. There is the underlying trend, which is a continued
growth in our Wealth business, which has been there quarter after quarter. It's a result of both our increased
investment in this space. It's a result of us winning market share, given our brand and franchise. It's also a result
of the underlying market growing. As you've seen, Hong Kong is now expected to become the largest private
wealth hub in the world by the end of the decade. So, that is definitely a trend and we're privileged with our
position in Hong Kong to be able to benefit from it and benefit our customers from it.
That is the first component, which is an underlying continued investment and growth trend. You add to that,
obviously, the additional activity we've seen following the measures that have been taken in China. This has
created additional activity, which has been, as you said, for a week or so in the third quarter. We do see this
activity continuing and obviously normalizing. But we do see these measures that have been taken to be
supportive measures, certainly of the economy at large, but in particular supportive measures of the financial
markets and the revival of some of the financial market sluggishness that we've seen both in mainland China and
Hong Kong over the last few quarters. Jon?

Interim Group Chief Financial Officer & Global Financial Controller, HSBC Holdings Plc
So, if I pick up your second point on Hong Kong CRE, it's actually a very similar picture to that we described at the
second quarter. So, a few customers continue to face cash flow pressures. Some of that is rates resultant. And as
rates come off, we would hope that begins to abate some of those cash flow pressures. If you look at the Asia
wholesale Stage 3s, they were up $1.1 billion in the quarter. Some of that relates to Hong Kong CRE. That also
drove a modest amount of additional RWAs.
The ECLs on that we've referred to the fact that there was $100 million charge on ECLs, that was both across
Stage 1 and Stage 2. The Stage 3 ratio is slightly up quarter on quarter. But we continue to see good collateral
across that portfolio. And so, we don't see this as a material ECL driver going forward. Our focus is really on
supporting our customers through this period as there's pressures we should see start to reduce as rates recede.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. And as we said, Gurpreet, we are confident about the outlook of the Hong Kong economy at large and the
Hong Kong commercial real estate sector in particular, partly because of the rates receding, as Jon was just
mentioning, but also partly due to the policy measures and the countercyclical measures that have been taken
this month to support the sector. We see these as having positive developments for the outlook of the market.
Thank you very much, Gurpreet.

Morning.

Dekai Hou Q
Analyst, China International Capital Corp. Ltd.
My first question is on the structural hedge. I think, George, you mentioned that $25 billion is a good run rate for
you, [indiscernible] (39:39) to build up the structural hedge in the second half. But in Q3, that increased by $27
billion, and maybe most of that comes from FX impact. So, do you still stick to a $25 billion run rate? Or you would
like to accelerate it?
And the second question is on – I would like to hear your thoughts on what area HSBC can further make
investments, because it feels like over the years, our strategy always emphasized that the bank had to make
excellent, good cost discipline and we did it. And we made some investments, but mostly small ones. So, if we
look forward, do you see any opportunities that may help us to further drive growth and take market share? Or do
you think it's better to stay cautious as we are still facing some top line pressures? Thank you.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2024
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Jeremy. Let me address your second question on investments, and then Jon can address your
structural hedge question. So, first, as you said, cost discipline, I've taken it from my role – my days in my CFO
role with me as CEO, it is embedded in the organization and we will maintain cost discipline. You should expect
this to be ingrained in the way we think, spending wisely and in the right places. In terms of strategy, in the
reorganization we announced last week, we are basically organizing ourselves alongside our strategic pillars. So,
this creates clarity and this also creates simplicity in the way we can execute our strategy.
We have two home markets where we have scale, a leading market position, and great growth opportunities and
certainly very strong competitive edge. In our Corporate and Institutional Banking business, we have a global
connectivity capability and a Transaction Banking capability that is second to none, that is very leading and
providing excellent services to our customers. Our positioning is very cherished and very valued by our
customers.
And then we have Wealth and Premier Banking, which is really the proposition aimed at the affluent segment for
investment needs, in particular, across our network and in particular also in Asia and the Middle East. Any
opportunity we have to accelerate this strategy, be it organic or inorganic, is an opportunity we will go after. We
are looking, these areas all exhibit fantastic growth opportunities.
We have a real competitive edge, and we will continuously invest in them both organically and inorganically, if the
opportunities arise. What I should say there is, we do have the capital to support our needs. We have the capital
to support, obviously, our dividend distribution, to support organic growth and to support inorganic opportunities,
should we find some that can accelerate our strategy and allow us to gain market share. Jon?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan Bingham A
Interim Group Chief Financial Officer & Global Financial Controller, HSBC Holdings Plc
Jeremy, if I pick up your question on structural hedge. As you rightly say, we have increased our structural hedge
during the period from $504 billion at the 30th of June to $531 billion at the 30th of September. But that was
mostly FX driven. The duration of that remains 2.8 years. We would continue to expect to increase our structural
hedge, but that will depend on market conditions that we have. And I would say that the big increases of our
structural hedge are probably behind us. So, further increases from here will only have a modest impact on our
banking NII sensitivity. Thanks, Jeremy.

Katherine Lei Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities (Asia Pacific) Ltd.
Hi. Thanks, George and thanks, Jon. So, my questions will be two. The first one I would like to ask about NII. I
think the confusing thing here is that I think the headline NII actually slightly missed the expectation. But if we
work out the banking NII, there's a moderate beat and also we try to calculate what is the banking net interest
14

margin, it seems it's by and large stable, despite in 3Q however actually went down kind of, on average, 50 basis
points. So, may I ask like what is driving that stable net interest margin? Would it be from the liabilities
management side?
I mean just now Jon gave us some color in terms of like, say, deposit migration. But is that possible to give me
some – give us some like numbers to work around? Like, what is the CASA ratio in Hong Kong and how the trend
has changed? So, this will be my first questions.
My second question is that when I look at the RWA migration, I saw on the – on numerator, I saw that in the
migration side, and there is a $2 billion addition to CET1 capital due to movement in reserves. Can we get a bit of,
how to say, color on that ones? Will we be seeing some kind of movement, like similar type of movement in the
coming quarters?
Actually, I have one slight additional questions, is on the loss that we were talking about the legacy securities.
Can you give us a bit of color on this one? And understand that management put this into notable items or
supposedly to be one-off, but is it really one-off in nature? Will we have other securities, perpetual bonds that we
would like to redeem in the future? Like, say, for example, do we have another 10% type of perpetual bond
currently in our book that we may be looking to redeem it when opportunities arise? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Katherine. I'm going to let Jon answer the three questions, but allow me one comment on the legacy
securities. We have said that we will look at our legacy securities continuously, but we will take action that are
accretive or neutral. We will not take action on legacy securities that are detrimental to our investors and our
shareholders.
In this case, we've taken an action on a legacy security that has a more than 10% coupon that could be naturally
and easily replaced with much lower rates. And therefore, there is a positive impact on the net present value basis
of the actions we've taken. And these actions we will always look at where there is value in it. Jon?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan Bingham A
Interim Group Chief Financial Officer & Global Financial Controller, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So, thanks, Katherine. Three questions there. So, if I start on your net interest margin, we give some detail
on the net interest margin on page 17 of the slide deck. But effectively, the net interest margin has moved from
1.62% to 1.46%. There's three things driving that. One, the loss on the early redemption of legacy securities, as
you've mentioned. Two, some Argentina volatility. And then the remaining is on – we've allocated more funding to
the trading book. And as you know, that will be a drag on net interest income, but also an equal and opposite
benefit on non-net interest income.
So, our preferred measure, and the way that we think about it, is through the banking NII lens. There you'll see
that our clean run rate, ex-Argentina and ex the notables, has been relatively stable period on period, reflecting
the fact that the Q3 rate cuts had – given their timing, had a modest impact on Q3.
You'd also asked about deposit migration. We've, again, got some detail in that on slide 17, but that has remained
relatively stable at 39% for the Hong Kong deposits. If I move on to your CET1 question and then particularly the
change in other adjustments for CET1 capital, that is around the fair value movements of our securities that are
classified as fair value through OCI. So, we've generated a gain on those which has given us also a capital benefit
on that.

Operator: Our final question today comes from Edward Firth at KBW. Please accept the prompt to unmute your
line.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Firth Q
Analyst, KBW
Yeah. Morning everybody, and thanks for taking the questions. I just have two questions. One was just a
clarification. Just to be clear, the $1.1 billion increase in Stage 3 loans in Hong Kong, is that all CRE? Just to be
clear on that. That was the first question.
The second one is, we've obviously got a US election coming up in the next couple of weeks. And I just wondered
if you could give us some thoughts, from your perspective, in terms of the possible sort of risks and opportunities
that you see that could come out of that, I guess, with the two realistic options. And I guess just related to that,
there was a lot of press comment that your reorganization was driven by splitting up the Asian and I guess the UK
or developed markets businesses. Is that actually right, or was that just sort of idle speculation from journalists?
Great. Thanks so much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Okay. Thank you, Ed. Let me take your second and third questions, and Jon can address the Stage 3 question.
So, look, this is a matter for the US electorate to choose their president. I'm not going to speculate or comment.
We will see the outcomes on the 5th of November. But what is important for us is that we serve our customers.
We have been serving our customers through various – well, through an evolving set of rules and regulations on
the global scale.
We serve them for their needs, especially for their cross-border needs, where we're unique at being able to do so.
We obviously comply with all rules and regulations. We will make sure that our customers are able to comply with
all rules and regulations insofar that their financial needs are concerned. And any new rules and regulations,
which may come with any new administration, are things that we will obviously comply with and support our
customers to comply with.
What I can say, though, is it remains a distinctive skill that we have in supporting our customers' cross-border
needs. This is one of our unique areas of competitive edge. And this remains unchanged, and our customer
needs remain broad based and global. And we will continue supporting them on that mission.
And with regards the reorganization, this is categorically not either an intent or a preparation, as has been
speculated by some, splitting of the Asia business or et cetera. Absolutely not. This is a simplification of the bank,
where we today govern our self through five regions, and we're bringing this regional setup down to two. That is
part of the simplification.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2024
It is also meant to help us speed up the buildout of what is a very promising corridor between the Middle East and
Asia. We're seeing material growth in this corridor over the last few years. Our customers across both Middle East
and Asia are looking for opportunities of trade and investments between them and we've been – we have a
leading – we have a unique position to be able to help our customers across this corridor. That simplification
should also help speed up the build of that corridor.
And I remind you in our Western geographies now, we're essentially a wholesale bank. We have sold our retail
banking activities in France. We've sold the mass retail activities in the US. We've sold the bank in Canada.
We've sold the bank in Greece. We are in the process of selling the bank in Argentina, and with that we'll be left
with, what is essentially, a Corporate and Institutional Banking business that also bring some simplification
aspects to the way we govern our self in this region. These are the reasons why we did the simplification of the
organization we announced last week. Jon?

Edward Firth Q
Analyst, KBW
Great. Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan Bingham A
Interim Group Chief Financial Officer & Global Financial Controller, HSBC Holdings Plc
On your CRE question, Ed. So, of the $1.1 billion increase in Asia wholesale Stage 3s, most of that was Hong
Kong CRE. The picture is very similar to how we described it at the second quarter. We could see more
migrations into Stage 3 until interest rates begin to ease the cash flow pressures in those businesses. But given
the collateral levels that we have against that portfolio, we don't see that as a major driver of ECL risk going
forward. And we are focused on supporting our customers through this transition period. Thanks, Ed.

return on tangible equity for 2024 and for 2025, excluding notable items. And I'm committed to building on this,
which our organization will enable us to do, by simplifying and streamlining the group. We will share more details
at our full-year results in February as part of a wider business update. Neil and the team are available to answer
