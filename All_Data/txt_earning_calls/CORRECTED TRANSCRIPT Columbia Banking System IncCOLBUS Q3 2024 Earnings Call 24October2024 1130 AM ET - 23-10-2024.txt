Q3 2024 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2024
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Welcome to the Columbia Banking System Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this
time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-
answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. At this time,
I would like to introduce Jacque Bohlen, Investor Relations Director, to begin the conference call.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jacquelynne Bohlen
Senior Vice President & Investor Relations Director, Umpqua Bank
Thank you, Gigi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us as we review our third quarter results. The
earnings release and corresponding presentation are available on our website at columbiabankingsystem.com.
During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties and are
intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. For a list of factors that may cause
actual results to differ materially from expectations, please refer to the disclosures contained within our SEC
filings. We will also reference non-GAAP financial measures, and I encourage you to review the non-GAAP
reconciliations provided in our earnings materials.
I will now hand the call over to Columbia's President and CEO, Clint Stein.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Jacque. And good morning, everyone. Our third quarter activities and results demonstrate our
commitment and continued progress toward regaining long-term, top-quartile performance. We grew core
deposits even as we reduced our cost. We also completed the near-term initiatives we detailed in April, and we
continue to reinvest in our people, systems, and processes to drive our franchise profitably forward. When we
spoke last quarter, I outlined the drivers of $270 million in merger to-date gross expense reductions, and we fully
achieved our target during the third quarter. Our operational effectiveness work eliminated redundancies and
streamlined operations, making our organization more efficient. This work is enabling us to better serve our
customers and our communities while enhancing long-term shareholder value.
Our gross expenses represented double to $135 million we outlined at the announcement of the merger. The
merger to date net savings of roughly $213 million accounts for $45 million of franchise expansion and
reinvestments made, leading up to and shortly after the merger close, as well as the additional $12 million of
investments planned in the coming months and quarters. Our expense run rate in the third quarter was just below
the expected fourth quarter annualized run rate we have consistently discussed since March. Planned
reinvestments will continue into 2025. Our cost conscious culture will support a reasonable amount of inflationary
lift from this level. However, we will continue to remain diligent with resource allocation and work to find expense
offsets for franchise reinvestment beyond the $12 million already earmarked. We believe our reinvestment dollars
will support the continued growth and competitiveness of our company.
We continue to remain an employer of choice for experienced bankers throughout our footprint. Our ability to
attract top talent enabled us to enter and grow our newer markets like Arizona, Colorado, and Utah, while
continuing to invest in long-established regions. Recent examples include establishing a team of seasoned private
bankers in Colorado, commercial banking teams in Southern Idaho and Northern California, and the new market
leader for Southern Nevada. In all cases, these new team members have spent their careers serving a broad

range of customers, ranging from families and entrepreneurs up through larger commercial clients within these
markets.
We opened our second retail branch in Arizona and announced a planned third location in Mesa to supplement
the commercial teams that established our presence in the state three years ago. Subsequent to quarter end, we
have identified the site for our fourth Arizona office and we'll provide more specific details on next quarter's call.
We also continue to enhance our internal technology in support of our associates. We are piloting applications to
improve efficiency and we are onboarding 1,000 associates to an upgraded CRM tool. The third quarter also
included a reduction in transactional loans and funding sources. Solid seasonal customer deposit growth and an
intentional reduction in transactional real estate loans enabled us to reduce brokered deposits by 20% during the
quarter. Although commercial loan growth was below our expectations, portfolio activity reflected healthy
customer behavior, which Chris will cover in more detail.
We're very optimistic for the future of our company. With the merger and integration behind us, activity throughout
our organization is fully focused on driving balanced growth with new and existing customers, and we continue to
win business every day. We're driving franchise value through relationship banking, and we will continue to
opportunistically reduce our exposure to transactional loans and funding sources. We continue to remain laser
focused on regaining Columbia's placement as a top performing bank that produces long-term, consistent, and
repeatable results.
I'll now turn the call over to Ron.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Okay. Thank you, Clint. We reported second quarter EPS of $0.70 and operating EPS of $0.69 per share. And
our operating return on tangible equity was 16% while the operating PPNR was $221 million. Please refer to the
non-GAAP reconciliations provided at the end of our earnings release and presentation for details related to our
calculation of operating metrics
On the balance sheet, we maintained our target interest bearing cash levels of approximately $1.5 billion. As Clint
mentioned, loans declined $200 million in the quarter, driven mostly by reduced transactional loans, and deposits
in total were flat. Within deposits, we saw the seasonal increase in noninterest-bearing DDA, along with strong
customer interest-bearing deposit growth, and utilized the excess to reduce broker deposits by $635 million or
20%, along with reducing term borrowings of $0.25 billion. Within investments, the increase in available for sale
investments was market value driven as the bond market rallied during the quarter. The locked out structure of
the portfolio, combined with this rally, led to the 50% reduction in our accumulated other comprehensive loss,
adding $1.06 or 6% to our tangible book value per share. Overall, tangible book value per share increased 10% to
$17.81. Our net interest margin was stable at 3.56% in Q3 and on the upper end of our estimated range of 3.45%
to 3.60%. Our interest-bearing deposit cost declined to 2.95% for Q3.
Given the Fed's 50 basis point cut late in the quarter, it may help to compare the month of September to the
month of June. Our month of September interest-bearing deposit cost was 2.90%, down 10 basis points from 3%
in June. More importantly, the spot cost as of September 30 was 2.74%, down 26 basis points from the month of
June. This represents a beta of 52% in a very short period of time. And I want to thank all of our bankers and
support professionals for their timely work with customers on reducing deposit rates. It was great to see the speed
with which they worked, and it is reflective of a relationship banking strategy where our customers bank with us
for the value our bankers provide, not just rate.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2024
Absent any further Fed moves down, we expect continued reductions in our interest-bearing deposit costs in Q4,
given the [ph] term (00:08:20) structure on time deposit repricing and wholesale funding, along with continued
expected reductions in wholesale funding balances. Our projected interest sensitivity under both ramp and shock
scenarios remains in a liability sensitive position, and we expect our rates down deposit betas to approximate
those experienced on the way up.
Our slide deck includes enhanced repricing and maturity disclosure, including details on over $8 billion in
customer CDs and wholesale funding that matures over the next six months. Our provision for credit loss was $29
million for the quarter. The portion related to our leasing portfolio declined again as expected this quarter to $16
million. Our overall allowance for credit loss remains robust, increasing to 1.17% of total loans or 1.34% when
including the remaining credit discount.
Total GAAP expense for the quarter was $271 million, while operating expense was $268 million. In Q2, we had
the restructuring charge along with a nonrecurring credit. So, our operating expense of $268 million for Q3 was
lower than the $270 million normalized level in Q2 and $287 million in Q1, reflecting continued achievement of our
efficiency initiatives. The Q3 level, excluding CD amortization, annualizes at $957 million. Clint mentioned our
reinvestment plans earlier, which will increase our quarterly operating expense, excluding CD amortization into
the annualized range of $965 million to $985 million.
We expect continued annual inflation of approximately 3% on top of our expected Q4 exit range, inclusive of items
such as the typical Q1 payroll tax increase, a 7% increase in health insurance cost and the annual merit cycle for
the end of Q1. We'll always work to find additional efficiencies to help offset these pressures and enable
continued franchise reinvestment.
Now, I'll close with commentary about our regulatory capital position. Our risk-based capital ratios increased as
expected in Q3 and are now all above our long-term target levels. We expect capital ratios continue to build,
which will provide enhanced future allocation flexibility.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Frank.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank D. Namdar
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Ron. The stable performance of our loan portfolio highlights the strength of our through-the-cycle
underwriting process, portfolio management, and the quality of our borrowers and sponsors. As we transition to a
more typical credit environment after a period of exceptional quality, we observed a 22% improvement in 31 to 89
day delinquencies, reducing them to $67 million following similar improvements in the previous quarter. The slight
increase in nonaccrual loans and 90-plus delinquencies reflects normal business fluctuations and the migration of
smaller credits affected by higher interest rates. Classified loans declined due to risk rating upgrades and a payoff
during the quarter. Our proactive and detailed monitoring of the portfolio continues to reveal no systemic issues
across various industries, sectors or geographic regions. At the end of the quarter, there were effectively no
delinquencies in our entire non-owner occupied and multifamily portfolios with no charge-offs in either category.
Overall, net charge-offs for the company stood at an annualized rate of 31 basis points for the quarter, with the
bank contributing 10 basis points and FinPac 21. As mentioned in previous quarters, loss activity within FinPac
was anticipated to improve and did, by approximately 20% this quarter. Reflective of an annualized rate of 4.7%,
we are pleased with this progress, but we are not finished. We remain very satisfied with the quality and
directionality of our granular and diversified loan portfolio, which is detailed further in our investor presentation. It
remains relatively predictable and boring. [indiscernible] (00:12:49) waiting in line for a haircut.

I'll now turn the call over to Chris.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell
President-Consumer Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Frank. Customer deposit growth during the third quarter reflects continued success through targeted
small business campaigns, expanding balances with existing commercial and new relationship customers.
Customer deposit balances increased $602 million, enabling a 20% reduction in brokered deposits. Notably, core
deposit growth occurred even as we reduced the rate on both – on deposits, both ahead of and following the Fed
funds rate reduction in September. Our teams continue to lead the service, not price in their customer
interactions. Our branches ramped up their summer small business campaign in July and we launched new
campaign in September that will run through the next several weeks.
Through mid-October, our three highly successful campaigns have generated $600 million in new deposits, and
account retention from the first two campaigns exceeds 99%. We are also seeing a related increase in cross
department referrals as we work towards additional needs based solutions for our customers. As a reminder,
there are no special products or pricing associated with these campaigns and we would like to thank our bankers
for their focus and attention to driving new relationships to the bank. Loan balances declined by $207 million
during the quarter as we intentionally allowed transactional real estate balances to trend lower.
Healthy customer activity, which includes business and property sales as well as project completions, also
contributed to net portfolio contraction during the quarter. We continue to target a low-single-digit level of loan
growth in the current operating environment as our activities focus on relationship-driven commercial loans and
the balanced deposit and core fee income growth that activity supports. Our core fee income pipelines continue to
expand across all categories.
Treasury management and commercial card income increased by 12% and 19%, respectively, for the year-to-
date period. Income from wealth management is also up notably for the period as our teams continue to find
opportunities following our transition to a new broker dealer platform at the end of last year. Additionally, our trust
team is benefiting from our new, larger organization handling more referrals and onboarding new relationships.
While overall noninterest income remains a relatively smaller percentage of our total revenue, the favorable
trends in our collective product and service income will drive incremental bottom line growth over time, helping to
diversify our revenue stream while strengthening and deepening our customer relationships.
I'll now turn the call back over to Clint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hey. Thanks, Chris. We remain committed to optimizing our financial performance to drive long-term shareholder
value. Our bankers' activities and the organic run-off of transactional loans and funding sources drives us closer
to optimal capital efficiency. As Ron mentioned, our capital position continues to build and our ratios are
expanding in line with our expectations. With a total risk based capital ratio of 12.5% at the holding company and
12.2% at the bank, we are above our long-term targets of 12%. Our TCE ratio was 7.4% at quarter end, up from
6.8% at June 30, as capital generation received an added lift from favorable AOCI changes. Our performance
continues to demonstrate our ability to organically generate capital well above what is required to support prudent
growth and our regular dividend, providing us flexibility for considering additional returns to shareholders.

This concludes our prepared comments. Tory, Chris, Ron, Frank, and I are happy to take your questions now.
Gigi, please open the call for Q&A.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Clark from Piper Sandler.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Good morning, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Good morning, Matt.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Just on the core margin, we had a Fed cut obviously late in the quarter. We gave us the spot rates on deposits,
which is really helpful. But any color on kind of where your core NIM kind of [ph] settled (00:17:44) out at the end
of September, maybe on a spot basis or – and just your kind of near-term thoughts on the core NIM, given not
only the rate changes, but also your expectation for deposit flows.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, Matt. This is Ron. Yeah, on NIM, I mean, we're not declaring a victory on the inflection point
with the core up but the bigger driver is going to be, again, deposit flows. I do feel good about the tailwinds we
have with the $8 billion of CDs and wholesale funding that we laid out on that new table on slide 20. But again, I
think normalized deposit flows would be the key. Generally in the fourth quarter, we see it flat to up slightly early
in the quarter and then tailing off later in the quarter. This is, of course, long-term seasonal averages around
property tax payments, year-end distributions, things of that nature. So, we'll see how it plays out. But feel good
about the tailwinds at least at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then, just on the adjusted expense kind of annualized run rate guide, how do you feel about that
range? Do you feel like you could hit the low end of that range here in 4Q?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, I do. And more importantly, as we look at that range going into 2025, we talked about the expectation for
approximately 3% inflation on that. Generally seasonally over the course of the year, payroll taxes pop in Q1 and
Q2 and come down a bit in Q3, Q4. Merit cycles usually into Q1. Looking forward, the health insurance costs, of
course, are throughout the year, but feel good about that. We know we've got quite a few reinvestments that are
in flight. We'll make – continue to make additional reinvestments, but you're talking only a couple million dollars a

quarter annualized to get into the basically midpoint of that range [indiscernible] (00:19:33) right now. So, we're
pretty close.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Okay. And then, just on the buyback, Clint, I know rates are up here more recently, but definitely getting
closer to that 8%. You're above where you want to be, I think, on regulatory capital. I guess, any chance – I mean,
what's your expectation in terms of potentially buying back stock? We have to wait for mid-next year or do you
think it could be a lot sooner?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well, I mean, I think that this is ongoing conversations that Ron and I have with our board. And we're – as you
mentioned, we're above on the regulatory side. The 8% on TCE is kind of a range. It's not a hard floor like how we
view the, say, 12% on total risk-based capital, for example. So I do think that as we set out at the onset of the
announcement of the merger and what our expectations were in terms of capital generation utilization, that it was
going to be a capital return story for shareholders. And I do think in 2025, we enter into that window and that
dynamic. So in terms of timing of what it might look like, it's probably too preliminary to really pin that down. But it
is something that we're actively evaluating internally.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2024
I wanted to – let's start on these small business campaigns. I mean, you guys have had a ton of success with this.
Retention has been extremely high. I'm curious whether these have been more targeted to specific markets or
geographies or have they been broad based? And do you see additional opportunity here, I guess, for additional
campaigns and then just to deepen the relationship with those that you won and continue driving further growth, I
guess, on both the loan and deposit fronts?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
President-Consumer Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. David, this is Chris. Thanks for the question. It's really been and we've talked about it previously, it
continues to be broad based. It's across all markets, wide participation. All branches in every campaign have
achieved results in that. And it's really to – the relationship strategy, bringing in new relationships from the
standpoint of getting to know people, sharing what we do, sharing the value that our bankers bring each and
every day to those relationships, and in that kind of community bank at scale, the way that we think about things. I
think what's most impressive is we do continue to see the deepening of relationships with merchant and corporate
card and some wealth management referrals, treasury management referrals. So, the targeted businesses are
things that could continue to grow with us. We're also uncovering larger opportunities that get referred off to the
commercial bank. And we've got some great partnership stories. The team's working well together to land some
bigger relationships as well with it. But yeah, it's really it's across the board. We haven't armed them with, like you
say, any special pricing or product. It's everything we have off the shelf put together for the benefit of the
customer and solving their needs. And it's working out extremely well. We couldn't be more pleased.
Going forward, we'll take a little break here in about mid-November that everybody kind of catch up, refresh. And I
fully expect we'll have something that comes out in the first quarter of next year and we'll continue there. It's kind
of more of a way of life than it is a campaign, if you will.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay, that's great. And then you guys have also been active with expansion plans, right, both on the hiring side
and the expanding the branch network. You talked about that in the prepared remarks. How do you think about
opportunities going forward? It seems like Arizona is obviously a focus just given the branches that you're opening
there. But looking at the branch maps, Colorado, Utah, Nevada seem to be pretty attractive opportunities,
especially just given those hires. How do you think about de novo expansion opportunities? Where you're focused
in and whether organic the best way to do it, or could M&A be an opportunity to help supplement the organic
expansion that you're doing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hey, David. This is Tory. I'll take the first part of that and I'll let Chris and Clint kind of weigh in at the end of it.
Yeah. We have basically four, I would say, de novo markets over the last year and a half or so. We got Utah,
Colorado, Arizona, and then a little bit northern California and just kind of a specialty team that we've hired into
the bank and then kind of put a branch system around it, some private banking folks around it to kind of like fill in
this full relationship banking. I mean, one of the great things about the company is our – really our ability to attract
talent into the organization, as Clint mentioned earlier. I mean, folks want to be here and want to work here and
find this place to be a great place to be successful.
In all of those markets, the de novo markets, we've been profitable within a year, and they're starting to drive
some really nice balances and some growth in relationships. And really a prime example is our [indiscernible]

(00:25:39) team in Northern California. They've got about $17 million in outstanding loan balances and about $95
million in deposits, so just a really nice mix for the company and some really nice strong relationships. And we
see that all of our de novo markets. So, we'll continue to kind of infill on that and to grow as we are presented with
the opportunity to get the right talent into the company continuously.
Another real important market for us on the expansion plan is going to be Southern California. There's just
tremendous density in Southern California. We've got some really good strong teams there today and we've been
very successful. And we will continue to invest in the market and grow in Southern California as well. So, I think
really good opportunity just organically for us to continue to invest in those markets and to grow quite nicely.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. And I'll jump in on the back half of that question. As usual, David, you pack a lot into your questions. But
from an M&A perspective, our focus is really getting the most performance we can out of the company that we're
running today. And we're very excited about the opportunities that we have. And as Tory mentioned, those are de
novo markets but even our long, well-established markets. I mean, we continue to win new business every day
and take market share from the larger banks. And so, there's a lot of enthusiasm around what we can just do on
an organic basis. The M&A front itself, I mean it – I mean we should talk next quarter. There's quite a bit of
election activity going on and that whatever the outcome is, it will have an impact on a bank our size. And so, as
we get greater clarity on that, as we get greater clarity on where the Fed takes interest rates and how that looks,
our thoughts might change. But right now, that focus is truly on getting the most that we can out of the company
that we're running.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. That makes sense. And then, maybe just staying on the organic growth side, I mean, look, what we've
talked in the past about the pipeline your bankers have and the momentum that it seems to be picking up, it hasn't
necessarily materialized yet as payoffs and paydowns have been a headwind and some of the strategic runoffs in
the CRE book. But I'm curious how the pipeline is shaping up. Where are you seeing the most opportunity as you
think about that low-single-digit pace that you talked about and just competitive landscape on the growth front
from your seat?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, David, it's Tory again. The pipeline has been pretty stable and steady over the last several quarters. We
talked previously about the total pipeline staying about the same, but the mix changing from a real estate pipeline
being down a little bit and the C&I pipeline up a little bit. That continued even into this quarter. And the overall
number is about the same and it's a healthy loan pipeline spread throughout the company. So, we feel really good
about continuing the low- to mid-single-digit loan growth number and kind of core relationship banking, excluding
some of the transactional rundown and real estate that we'll see a little bit of as we continue go forward. It's a very
nice pivot in the company of moving away from transactional into full relationship banking. So, the lending piece is
just one part of it. And going back to even Chris' comment on small business campaigns of bringing small
business relationships into the bank, deposit in loan, and fee income relationships into the bank. So when we look
at the pipeline, the fee income pipeline is very strong and healthy. Chris mentioned a couple statistics on just
some growth we've had in Treasury and other parts of the company, and we'll continue to see that because the
bankers are doing exceptional job focusing on all different parts of a relationship to bring into the company as we
look to add value to our customers.

Jon Arfstrom Q

Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone.

Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Good morning, Jon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Just a follow-up on loans. Chris, can you talk about how large that pool of transactional loans are that you're
looking to reduce?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
President-Consumer Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well, I think we've previously talked about between multifamily and single family, was approximately $6 billion on
the balance sheet that didn't have relationships attached to them. And our bankers are working to try and
generate relationships. That's not always the easiest thing to do, but that gives you kind of a marker that's out
there. They come due over time, so it's not anything that happens tomorrow by any means, but it's always under
evaluation.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Yeah, it – just it seems like there was a pretty heavy prepayment quarter for you. Is that strictly from that or
is there anything else that's going on there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, let me – I'll just – this is Tory, I'll just weigh in a little bit on that part of it. One thing we did have was a very
large C&I loan that got paid off. The customer had a really nice business that we banked for a long period of time
and they sold it and somebody else wrote them a big giant check and they paid us off. So, that was kind of an
anomaly for what we typically see. But it was a pretty big number. So, that has an impact as well [indiscernible]
(00:32:06).

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2024
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. That's helpful. Good. Ron, on slide 21, it's a good slide, the balance sheet optimization slide. Well,
what do you want us to take away from the slide and what could make this more likely to happen?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
You might take away from this is recognize it's – these two items, together are a headwind today. In a lower rate
environment, they'll be relatively neutral. We look at it as – we've isolated this as non-relationship focus, so – and
consistent with our strategy going forward, but just more so from a visibility standpoint that we're going to have a
lot of optionality in the future as rates decline to reposition portions of the balance sheet, reallocate capital to
continue organic growth and reinvestment opportunities. So, really just calling out for the headwind it is today.
Ideally in the future, we'll be able to remove that when we get a bit lower on the rate side. Over time, these will run
down naturally based off scheduled amortization, but at some point in the future, we'll have the opportunities to
deleverage this portion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Good. So, nothing imminent [indiscernible] (00:33:14). Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. And then, just a follow-up on the small business deposit campaign. You said that's really not rate
driven, but what kind of pricing on those new deposits are you offering?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
President-Consumer Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
It's just our normal posted rates that are out there. And so, there's certainly a range in there, mid-3s to upper 3s.
There are some CDs that are still at about 4%, but let's say, it's just our posted rates and nothing special that
goes along with it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. All right. Thank you very much.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2024
Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey, good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
I was hoping to dig into maybe just some of the loan yield repricing dynamics, the core loan yield up kind of 6
basis points this quarter. It was maybe a little better than I expected, especially given the move or the leg down
we saw kind of mid-quarter and SOFR. So I guess it kind of implies that some of the repricing dynamics on the
fixed rate or adjustable rate is a bit better than I was thinking. Can you maybe just talk through some of those
dynamics? Over the next few quarters, how much you have kind of coming up that's fixed rate adjustable and the
incremental spreads you think you can get on those loans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Great questions. And I want to highlight, again, slide 20 of our investor presentation. And Jacque did a
great job pulling together all that information for you, bottom left, just in terms of the loan portfolio between fixed
maturity by period, floating repricing by period, and adjustable repricing by period. So you can see that tail over
time. And also, we'll call out again the very bottom of that table where we highlight the $8 billion – over $8 billion
of wholesale funding between brokered CDs and term advances, which will have repricing lower opportunities in
the quarter [indiscernible] (00:35:21) with the Fed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. So, if I'm reading it right, in like the four- to six-month bucket, call it, $500-ish million or so of fixed and
adjustable repricing, that sound like a fair amount kind of on a quarterly basis. And then what type of spread
pickup could you get on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Spread pickup, just in terms of [indiscernible] (00:35:45) reprice?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. Just like the – what's the adjustable or the fixed rate, say, for the $212 million? What's the yield on that
that's coming due versus where you're putting new loans on that today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well, this is Tory. I'll answer the new loan side, I mean, the new commercial production, it ranges based on asset
type, loan type, geography, et cetera. [indiscernible] (00:36:13) ranges from the mid-7s to mid-8s generally

speaking, for new loan activity. And it's been actually climbing just a little bit over the last several quarters, but
relatively stable.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. And just from a repricing standpoint, they'll continue to move higher just even as rates come down. The
spread, of course, depends on the loan type, which are mixed throughout those categories. But we'll see
continued repricing higher from that adjustable bucket.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And if I could just shift gears a little bit, I appreciate all the commentary around capital as well as the
discussion around the buyback. I'm just curious as you kind of have conversations with the board and you
contemplate incremental capital deployment from here, you've obviously also earmarked a couple of portfolios of
loans that are discontinued or kind of running down over time. I guess as you think about the buyback, is the other
contemplation potentially early exit of any of those kind of loan pools? And how do you compare and contrast the
attractiveness of the two?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well, we were – I guess in my prepared remarks, I was fairly generic in terms of capital alternatives. I didn't
specify buybacks. But I think, David, and you are zeroing in on that and that's certainly one of the things that we
can consider. In terms of an early exit from those transactional portfolios, I think, as Frank said credit is as boring
as waiting in line for a haircut. And we have zero concerns about the credit quality of these portfolios. And so, we
look at at, I think, in March when we first started identifying these and have been publicly talking about them
created an earnings – or it was an earnings headwind and it still is in terms of when you look at the wholesale
funding that we have on our balance sheet, the rates that we're paying on that versus the yields on these loans.
Now, as rates have come down, that earnings headwind is getting lighter and diminishing. It's still there.
But the market price, if we were to go price these and look at it, I mean, we just think about it like a bond. It's
going to price at a below par that would probably have a payback period that would exceed something that I
would think is reasonable given the expectation that rates are going to continue to come down. Also if our deposit
growth trends continue and we're able to continue to replace wholesale funding levels with good core customer
deposits, then it really doesn't create a need to do that. It will help our operating ratios. It'll free up some capital
obviously. But we're broadly above our most – well, pretty much all our regulatory ratio targets. We're trending in
the right direction towards where we'd like to be on a TCE basis. So, there's not a burning need or desire to do it
and with zero credit concerns on these portfolios. I think that the best thing for shareholders long term is to just
wait it out and either let them amortize off or when rates get to a certain point, then we can decide if we want to
selectively exit a substantial portion of any of these portfolios.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay, great. I appreciate all the color there. I'll step back. Thanks.

Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Chris
McGratty from KBW.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Oh, great. Thanks for the question. Just a quick one on credit. Your charge-offs were very stable. Your trends
were very good as well. Any update on – maybe I missed this, any update on FinPac normalization and any other
potential offsets that you're keeping an eye on? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank D. Namdar A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Sure. Yeah, as I alluded to in my remarks, we finally did see some material improvement in that number for
FinPac with them improving about 20%. That's about 4.7% annualized rate. I would expect that to come down
over time to somewhere in that 3.5% to 4% range. So, we've got a little bit to go and we do expect further
improvement. The fourth quarter, I'll say right now, is going to be tempered a bit because of just the difficult nature
of collection activity in the fourth quarter, because of holidays, vacations, and just the limited days that that
creates to collect accounts. But they will continue to drop and I think they will settle out at that 3.5% to 4% range.
So, delinquencies continue to decrease within that portfolio. That's another indicative sign that things are trending
the right way. I mean, from Q1 to Q3, delinquencies have improved 24% and nonperforming leases have also
reduced 24%. So, you can see how closely those numbers tie together, right? I mean – and we, in turn, saw a
reduction in charge-offs to 20%. So, things are trending in the right way. And there's nothing else systemically at
issue within that portfolio. It's normal activity and nothing systemic within the commercial C&I portfolio. So, we feel
pretty good about it.

My question is on the – good morning – the securities accretion. It seems prepayments maybe were elevated
again in 3Q, and I know you provided some color on kind of the near-term guide there. But I'm just wondering, the

last two – couple quarters of elevated paydowns, kind of what the remaining schedule might look like and if that
accretion has maybe pulled forward a little bit versus the original guide?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, I consider it to be relatively stable over time. The last two quarters, it was like an individual security
prepaid, which gave a little bit of a pop. But I'd expect to see that effective interest method amortization just to
ratably run down over time. You're not going to see a significant increase in that level unless you saw a rather
large rally in the bond markets driving prepays of securities purchased, say, in 2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. But borrowing any additional paydowns, I mean, should we expect that level somewhere in the low 30s
here going forward or are you saying low 40s and rate that down is the right run rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Low 30s specific to investment security discount accretion?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Right. Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
I don't have that number right in front of me here, but I'd assume pretty consistent trends just slightly lower than
we saw the last couple of quarters, over the next handful of quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay, great. And then certainly very encouraging on the early deposit trends with the cycle to date beta already
kind of in the 50s and additional opportunities through 1Q. I guess I'm trying to gauge the results to date versus
the expectation for beta to mirror what it had been on the way up, which also was somewhere in the mid-50s. Is a
lot of that liability sensitivity kind of front-end loaded over these next couple of quarters and then stabilizes out? I
guess, how are you thinking about cycle to date beta versus through the cycle beta with both of those seemingly
pretty similar here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, I mean, the historical modeling would suggest it's going to mirror and our disclosure suggests it's going to
mirror what we saw on the way to date. With some of the wholesale funding, we've been able to get close to that
level over the course of, what, two weeks in September. But I think in terms of the – your question is really the
time period of how long that plays out. Given the $8 billion of wholesale funding and the short-term nature of that,
it's really going to be more story of what's the tail or period of the Fed moving rates lower, right? If that all
occurred over the course of a couple of quarters and then they stop, then, yeah, that'd be your window. But if it's
over a longer period of time, that will just continue to reprice lower. Kind of like the conversation we had earlier on,

the $6 billion of non-relationship loans and multifamily, single family resi. It's a headwind today. At some point, it's
going to be relatively neutral, going to give us a lot of optionality.

Elian from JPMorgan.

Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi, everyone. Just a quick follow-up on NIM. So, your adjusted NIM increased about 7 basis points in the third
quarter. But just given the tailwinds you outlined on this call and on slide 20 on the funding side of the balance
sheet and the full benefit of the September cut, is it reasonable to assume a similar level of increase in the
adjusted NIM in the fourth quarter or I guess what would hold you back from realizing a similar increase? Thank
you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
It'd be bouncing along the bottom. And again, deposit flows will have such a bigger impact on that.
