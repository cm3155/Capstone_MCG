John M. Campbell
Director-Investor Relations, Wells Fargo & Co.
Thank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf;
and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being
recorded.
Before we get started I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings materials, including the release,
financial supplement and presentation deck, are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution
you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties.
Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings,
including the form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial
measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our
SEC filings in the earnings materials available on our website.
I will now turn the call over to Charlie.

Charles William Scharf
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll make some brief comments about our first quarter results, the
operating environment and update you on a few important topics. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review the
first quarter results in more detail.
We earned $4.7 billion or $1.05 per common share in the first quarter. As you can see, these results included a
$1.6 billion decrease in the allowance for credit losses. Higher net interest income more than offset a decline in
net interest income, and expenses are just beginning to reflect progress on our efficiency work. The impact of this
work should increase in the latter half of the year.
Credit quality continued to outperform our expectations with charge-offs at historical lows, but low interest rates
and tepid loan demand remained headwinds for us during the quarter. And we continue to manage within the
constraints of our asset cap, which require us to anticipate the inflows from government stimulus, effects of QE
and additional fiscal actions which could impact our balance sheet.
Overall economic trends improved during the quarter, and while there are risks, the likelihood of improvement
continues to increase and you certainly see this in the markets. Equity markets are rising, spreads have tightened
and liquidity is strong. Additional fiscal stimulus, continued monetary support and the acceleration of vaccine

availability provide a path to a more complete reopening and further economic expansion. US GDP growth is on
track to surpass its pre-pandemic peak by the end of the summer and is expected to increase in 2021 by more
than any year since 1984.
Overall, the consumer is strong, though there are inconsistencies which I will address later. Consumer net worth
was up 10% in 2020, hitting a new all-time high of $130 trillion. Personal savings is approximately $1.3 trillion
greater today than it was a year ago. It's expected that more than $1 trillion will be spent over the next five
months, and this does not include the impact of President Biden's proposed initiatives.
Wells Fargo customers, specifically as of last week, over $46 billion has flowed into our customers deposit
accounts related to round two and round three of federal stimulus payments and we estimate half has been spent
and half remains in their accounts. For our customers who received federal stimulus payments, their median
deposit balance was up 80% from a year ago, and for all of our customers, including customers who did not
receive stimulus payments, median balances were up 62% from a year ago.
Weekly debit card spend was up every week compared to a year ago the first quarter. The year-over-year
increase accelerated in mid-March due to the impact of last year's COVID-related restrictions and the impact of
stimulus payments and was up approximately 70% during this week last year of the quarter compared to a year
ago, but was up 35% compared to the same week in 2019. We're seeing increased consumer spending activity in
both travel and restaurants, two categories that have been particularly suppressed since the onset of COVID-19.
Specifically for travel, for the week ended April 2, debit card spend was up 422% compared to 2020 but was still
down 4% compared to 2019.
Consumer credit card weekly spend continues to strengthen over the course of the first quarter as well, and
ended the quarter up approximately 70% during the last week of the quarter compared to a year ago, but
importantly, up 8% compared to the same week in 2019.
Businesses remain strong as well. Most clients still have strong cash positions and line utilization remain low. The
demand for consumer products is high and dealer inventory levels are meaningfully lower versus historical levels.
After declining during the second half of the year, commercial loan balances seem to have stabilized and if the
economy continues to pick up, we would expect to see increased loan demand from our commercial customers in
the second half of the year.
With the vaccine distribution accelerating, I'm hopeful that we will be shifting to a more normal way of life soon,
but there's still many that will continue to need help as not all have benefited equally during the recovery.
Throughout the pandemic, our focus has been providing support for our customers and the communities we
serve, and we continued those efforts during the first quarter.
Since the pandemic began, we've helped 3.7 million consumer and small business customers by deferring
payments and waiving fees. In addition to our $10.5 billion of PPP funding in 2020, in the first quarter we funded
approximately 70,000 loans, totaling $2.8 billion under the latest round of the Paycheck Protection Program. This
year, we focused even more on small and diverse businesses and our average loan size was $40,000, down from
$54,000 last year. We have the lowest average loan size amongst our large bank peers. 96% have been for
businesses with fewer than 20 employees. 43% have gone to businesses in either low-to-moderate income areas,
or majority/minority census tracks totaling more than $6 billion between this year and last year.
We committed last year to donate approximately $420 million of our fees from the PPP program and established
our Open for Business Fund. We're in the process of distributing these funds to a combination of CDFIs and not-

for-profits that serve diverse small businesses. To-date we have distributed over $125 million and are working to
accelerate distribution of the remaining funds. We estimate that these actions have protected more than 66,000
jobs and hope to make an even more substantial impact with the funds remaining.
As we announced yesterday, we have invested in 11 Black Minority-owned Deposit Institutions as part of our $50
million commitment to support MDIs. We expect to complete our investments in another two by the end of the
second quarter. And as I mentioned before, we processed over $46 billion of customer deposits related to the
federal stimulus payments through last week, and have cashed stimulus payments for non-customers without
charging fees.
While we're proud of these actions, we know there is still more to do. Lower-income families and individuals as
well as minority-owned small businesses will continue to need support and we will continue to look for ways to
help. Climate change is one of the most urgent environmental and social issues of our time, and last month, Wells
Fargo announced a major step in our efforts to support the transition to a low-carbon economy by setting a goal of
net zero greenhouse gas emissions including financed emissions by 2050. We committed to publish data on our
financed emissions and set interim goals as we work closely with our clients in this transition. We also released
our first Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures report in the first quarter, which provides an update
on our progress managing climate-related risks and opportunities.
Let me turn to make some comments about our strategic priorities. Last quarter, in my shareholder letter, I
discussed the â€“ and in the shareholder letter actions we're taking to improve our performance, and we're making
good progress. We continue to prioritize the work necessary to build the appropriate risk and control
infrastructure, and it remains our top priority. As a reminder, this is a multiyear journey. Progress may not be a
straight line, and while we still have significant work to do, we are diligently doing what's necessary, issue by
issue. It's hard to share specifics given the nature of the work, but I believe we're making progress and we're
confident in our ability to complete the work.
In terms of business exits, I highlighted on the call last quarter that we were focusing our efforts on our core
scaled businesses, and after rigorous reviews, we were in the process of exploring options for businesses that
were not consistent with our strategic priorities. Mike will cover the financial details, but in the first quarter, we
announced agreements to sell Wells Fargo Asset Management and the Corporate Trust Services businesses,
and both are expected to close in the second-half of this year. In addition, we completed a portion of the sale of
the student loan portfolio and we completed the sale of the majority of the remaining portfolio recently. We're
pleased that we have found buyers who we believe have a similar approach to service and are focused on
providing clients with innovative products and solutions. These announcements are an important step to
simplifying our business and allowing us to focus on our core strategic priorities.
Our work to simplify how we operate and create a more efficient organization continues. We made progress on
our branch staffing and network optimization plans as we calibrate for changing customer behaviors and more
traffic migrates to digital channels. We continued to execute on our Commercial Banking transformation as we
optimize our coverage and operations model, consolidate lending platforms, and automate and standardize many
manual processes such as on-boarding a customer pain point which has been key for us.
And across the entire enterprise, we continue our ongoing efforts to reduce management layers to speed
decision-making and reduce unnecessary bureaucracy. We're also focused on moving our businesses forward. A
few examples. On the Consumer Banking side, we're accelerating our investments in digital with a particular focus
on delivering a simple, easy-to-use, best-in-class customer experience for the most-used mobile app features.
We're also simplifying and enhancing our product line, including launching Clear Access Banking, our low-cost no

overdraft product, and we've opened over 500,000 new accounts since the launch last fall. And this summer, we
will be improving the benefits of our portfolio by Wells Fargo checking customers.
As I've spoken about before, we're under-penetrated in credit card given our customer footprint, and we're
working on developing a significantly improved value proposition that we can introduce to the market. And on the
commercial side, we're going after the middle-market Investment Banking opportunity in a different way than we
have previously. This includes joint accountability, investments in talent, name-by-name client prioritization and
joint account planning.
Mike will discuss capital more in his remarks, but our position remains extremely strong. We repurchased almost
$600 million of common stock in the quarter, and based on the restrictions still in place for the second quarter, we
have the capacity to return approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders. As a reminder, our asset cap limits our
ability to deploy excess capital to our customers. Returning capital to shareholders remains a priority, and we look
forward to resuming capital returns under the stress capital buffer methodology starting in the third quarter.
Last quarter, I discussed constraints to achieving return on tangible common equity greater than 10% and then
around 15%. I should note that those returns did not include credit loss reserve releases. The asset cap and
capital return restrictions continue, but the progress on vaccination distribution, ongoing monetary policy,
additional fiscal stimulus and higher interest rates are helpful. We're in the midst of a multiyear transformation,
and I'm confident that our operational and financial performance will continue to benefit from the progress we're
making.
I'd like to end by acknowledging that we've asked so much of our entire Wells Fargo team, and I'm proud of all the
work they've done to support our customers and the communities we serve. We will continue to do all we can to
support an equitable recovery and help those most in need of our support.
I will now turn the call over to Mike.

Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Thanks, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Charlie highlighted many other ways, we're actively helping our
customers and communities, which we highlighted on slide 2. So I'm going to start with our first quarter financial
results on slide 3. Net income for the quarter was $4.7 billion or $1.05 per common share. Revenue grew from
both a year ago and the fourth quarter as the decline in net interest income was more than offset by higher non-
interest income. Our first quarter results included a $1.6 billion decrease in the allowance for credit losses, and as
a reminder, in the first half of last year, we built reserves by a total of $11.5 billion and we had $18 billion of
allowance for credit losses at the end of the first quarter.
We completed the sale of approximately half of our student loan portfolio in the first quarter, which resulted in a
$208 million gain and $104 million goodwill write-down, and we closed the majority of the remaining portfolio just
this past weekend. Our effective income tax rate in the first quarter was 6.4%, which included net discrete income
tax benefits related to closing out prior-year's tax matters.
Our capital and liquidity remained strong. Our CET1 ratio increased to 11.8% under the standardized approach
and 12.6% under the advanced approach. We repurchased 17.2 million shares of common stock for a total of
$596 million, and we had $33 billion of excess capital over our CET1 regulatory minimum at quarter end. Our
liquidity coverage ratio was 127%.

Turning to slide 5, which summarizes the financial impact of the business sales Charlie highlighted, we have
included the 2020 revenue and expense associated with the businesses on the slide. While they represented a
little over 3% of 2020 revenue, the pre-tax earnings is much smaller. Note that the table does not include the
credit cost associated with the student loan portfolio, which can have a meaningful impact on the business' P&L
and the expected expense reductions related to this business are incorporated into our $53 billion outlook for the
year.
Also, the expenses we've included related to the Corporate Trust and Asset Management businesses are the total
expenses for those businesses. Some of those expenses may continue after we close the deals, as we have
transitioned service agreements and roughly 10% to 20% of those expenses are items such as corporate
overhead that will take time to manage out of the expense run rate.
In terms of segment reporting, the Asset Management business is now reported in Corporate. Given that we
announced the sale of the Corporate Trust business late in the quarter, that business is still included in
Commercial Banking and will move to the corporate sector in the second quarter.
Turning to credit quality on slide 6. Our net charge-off ratio in the first quarter declined to 24 basis points, the
lowest it's been in a number of years and down 14 basis points from a year ago. Our losses have trended
significantly better than our expectations due to the impact of forbearance programs and the unprecedented
amounts of government stimulus. While there's still a lot of uncertainty, there are encouraging and improving
trends related to commercial credit quality.
Commercial net loan charge-offs declined $159 million from the fourth quarter to 13 basis points, the lowest loss
rate since the third quarter of 2019. The improvement was broad-based with declines in all asset types, including
$116 million of lower commercial real estate losses. As we have done since the start of the pandemic, we
continued to closely monitor our exposure to retail, hotel and office property types. The reopening of the economy
has had a positive impact on retail and hotel as cash flow levels have begun to improve. That said, stress remains
â€“ and retail in particular was the driver of charge-offs in the first quarter. Though clearly there are negative
demand trends in many office markets, the office portfolio continued to perform well and we're not seeing
widespread stress in the portfolio as of now.
Consumer net charge-offs declined $221 million from a year ago with improvements across all asset types but
increased $88 million for the fourth quarter with higher losses in other Consumer Loans and Credit Card but still
continued to be low.
Nonperforming assets declined $692 million or 8% from the fourth quarter, driven by lower commercial
nonaccruals primarily due to declines in Energy and Commercial Real Estate nonaccruals. $10.7 billion of our
consumer loan portfolio excluding government insured loans remained in COVID-related payment deferrals at the
end of the first quarter. We stopped offering non-real-estate-related COVID referrals in the fourth quarter, and
98% of the balances that were still in deferral at quarter-end were real estate related. Loans that have already
exited COVID deferrals have continued to perform better than we anticipated, with over 95% of the balances
current as of the end of the first quarter. Though we're still not all the way back to pre-pandemic levels, we've
continued to adjust our credit policies to reflect better economic conditions.
Due to the reserve release in the first quarter, our allowance coverage ratio declined from the fourth quarter but
was up 90 basis points from a year ago. Similar to the fourth quarter while observed performance has been
strong, there was still a significant amount of uncertainty reflected in our allowance level at the end of the first
7

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2021
quarter, and we'll continue to assess the level of our allowance. If the economic trends continue, we would expect
to have additional reserve releases.
On slide 8, we highlight loans and deposits. Our average loans declined for the third consecutive quarter and
were down 9% from a year ago. The decline from the fourth quarter was driven by lower residential real estate
loans due to continued high prepayments and re-securitization of loans we purchased out of mortgage-backed
securities last year. Real estate loan balances have been impacted by actions we took early last year to
discontinue correspondent nonconforming originations in home equity lending.
We have started to originate correspondent nonconforming loans again and should start to see more volume from
this channel over time. Commercial loans were relatively stable from the fourth quarter but were down 8% from a
year ago when there was a strong borrower draw activity during the early stages of the pandemic. Average
deposits grew $55.5 billion, or 4% from a year ago and 1% from the fourth quarter, with growth in our Consumer
businesses and Commercial Banking partially offset by declines in the Corporate Investment and Banking
business, Corporate Treasury reflecting targeted actions to manage under the asset cap.
With continued deposit growth, we have been actively managing down our long-term debt outstanding. We
tendered for $6.8 billion of senior and subordinated debt in the first quarter, and along with maturities total long-
term debt declined $29.6 billion or 14% from the fourth quarter and was down 23% from a year ago.
Turning to net interest income on slide 9. Net interest income declined 5% from the fourth quarter, driven by two
fewer days, unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results, continued re-pricing of the balance sheet and
lower loan balances. These impacts were partially offset by the benefit of lower long-term debt.
On the call last quarter, we provided our 2021 net interest income outlook. We still expect net interest income to
be flat-to-down 4% from the annualized fourth quarter level of $36.8 billion as the benefit of a steeper yield curve
has been largely offset by softer than anticipated loan demand, low utilization rates on commercial loans and
faster than expected prepayments on residential mortgages.
That said, it's important to recognize we are still early in the year, and our ultimate results for the year will remain
dependent on how rate and lending environments evolve. If rates follow the current forward curve and commercial
loans grow as the economic recovery gains momentum, which is expected by the industry, we would expect NII to
land near the high end of the range. However, if loan demand proves softer than expectations, our total loan
balance or â€“ and our total loan balance remains flat compared with where we ended the first quarter, we would
expect to finish closer to the middle of the range. We continue to closely monitor the evolving trends across each
of the major drivers and will provide updates to our outlook as the year progresses.
Turning to expenses on slide 10. Non-interest expense increased 7% from a year ago, driven by increased
personnel expense. Deferred comp expense reduced personnel expenses in the first quarter of last year by $598
million. As a reminder, late in the second quarter of last year, we changed how we hedge deferred compensation,
which reduced the volatility in our reporting for this item starting in the third quarter of last year. Personnel
expense also increased from a year ago from higher incentive and revenue-related compensation, including the
impact of higher market valuations on stock-based compensation, which was partially offset by lower salaries.
All other expense was down 4% from a year ago, driven by lower professional services expense due to efficiency
initiatives. Our expenses declined 5% from the fourth quarter as seasonally higher personnel expense was more
than offset by lower restructuring charges and operating losses. Our 2021 expense outlook is unchanged at
approximately $53 billion, with lower annualized expenses towards the end of the year. As we said on our last
8

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2021
earnings call, our outlook excludes restructuring charges and the costs of business exits such as the $104 million
goodwill write-down related to the sale of student loans. We assumed $1 billion of operating losses in the outlook.
The first quarter included $213 million of operating losses. But as you know, these expenses can be lumpy
especially as we continue to resolve legacy issues.
We also assumed approximately $500 million of incremental revenue-related expenses as these have been
higher-than-expected so far this year, due to strong equity markets which is a good thing, as revenue more than
offsets any increase. If the current market level holds, we would expect incremental revenue-related
compensations this year to be approximately $800 million, but we are still early in the year and will update you as
the year progresses. We are continuing to execute on efficiency initiatives, and additional initiatives continue to be
identified and vetted.
Turning to our business segments starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on slide 11. Net income
increased from a year ago driven by revenue growth in Home Lending and lower provision for credit losses.
Consumer and Small Business Banking revenue declined 6% from a year ago, primarily due to the impact of
lower interest rates and lower deposit-related fees. The decline in deposit-related fees was driven by higher
average checking account balances and higher COVID-related fee waivers. We expect a high level of Paycheck
Protection Program loan forgiveness in the second quarter, which would result in higher net interest income. But
as a reminder, the fees on those loans originated last year are being donated, so you will see a corresponding
increase in donation expense. So it won't impact the bottom line.
Home Lending revenue increased 19% from a year ago on higher retail originations, and gain on sale margins.
The 12% increase from the fourth quarter was primarily due to higher mortgage banking income related to the re-
securitization of loans we purchased from mortgage-backed securities last year and an increase in retail
originations. Credit Card revenue declined 2% from both the fourth quarter and a year ago due to lower loan
balances reflecting elevated payment rates.
We continue to make progress in executing our efficiency initiatives in our branches. Transaction volume
continues to shift away from our branches with 82% of Consumer and Small Business deposits in the first quarter
done digitally, up from 76% a year ago. We have closed 395 branches since the first quarter of 2020, including 90
branches in the first quarter of 2021. We're on track to complete the remainder of the 250 branches we expect to
consolidate this year. We've also continued to adjust staffing levels including the reductions related to branch
closures. Importantly to date, we've been able to make these adjustments while reducing customer attrition and
improving client satisfaction.
Turning to some key business drivers on slide 12. Our first quarter retail mortgage origination volume was the
highest since 2016. Total mortgage originations increased 8% from a year ago as a $6.7 billion decline in
correspondent originations was more than offset by $10.5 billion of higher retail originations. Total mortgage
originations declined 4% from the fourth quarter due to the seasonal slowdown in the purchase market, and as
growth in retail originations was more than offset by decline in correspondent originations.
While the mortgage origination market is expected to decline in the second quarter, as the anticipated increase in
the seasonal purchase market is expected to be more than offset by decline in re-financings, we currently expect
our origination volume to be robust as we have strong demand in the retail channel, and we continue to build up
volume in the correspondent nonconforming market.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2021
Auto originations increased 32% from the fourth quarter and 8% from a year ago in a strong market with supply
shortages for both new and used cars. With the improving economic forecast, we are gradually returning to pre-
pandemic underwriting policies.
Turning to debit card. Purchase volume increased 3% from seasonally strong fourth quarter levels. Debit card
volume increased 20% from a year ago, reflecting higher consumer spending due to stimulus payments and
improving economic conditions, and Credit Card purchase volume declined from seasonally high fourth quarter
levels. Purchase volume was up 6% from a year ago, as lower year-over-year volume early in the quarter due to
continued reductions in travel and entertainment spend was more than offset by growth in March.
Commercial Banking net income was up from both the fourth quarter and a year ago due to decline in the
provision for credit losses. Middle Market Banking revenue declined 20% from a year ago, driven by the impact of
lower interest rates as well as lower loan balances from reduced client demand and line utilization. Asset-Based
Lending and Leasing revenue grew 7% from a year ago, driven by higher net gains and equity securities in our
strategic Capital business, as first quarter 2020 included impairments due to decline in market valuations. This
was partially offset by lower net interest income in the first quarter of 2021 from lower loan balances.
Non-interest expense increased 4% from a year ago, primarily driven by higher technology spend, partially offset
by lower head count and consulting expense related to efficiency initiatives. Average loans declined for the third
consecutive quarter and were down 19% from a year ago, as COVID-related draws were repaid and loan demand
and credit line utilization remained weak. Average deposits were up 8% from a year ago, as stimulus programs
have injected significant liquidity into the market.
Turning to the Corporate and Investment Banking business on slide 14. In Banking, revenue declined 6% from a
year ago, driven by the impact of lower interest rates and lower deposit balances and grew 7% from the fourth
quarter. The linked-quarter growth was driven by a 20% increase in Investment Banking revenue, with strong debt
and equity originations partially offset by decline in advisory fees from strong fourth quarter levels.
Commercial Real Estate revenue grew 5% from a year ago, primarily due to improved CMBS gain on sale
margins, driven by spread tightening as well as an increase in low income housing tax credit income. Markets
revenue increased 19% from a year ago, and strong client demand for Asset-backed finance products, other
credit products and municipal bonds, which was partially offset by lower demand for rates, products and lower
equities and commodities revenue. Average deposits declined 27%, and average trading-related assets were
down 14% from a year ago, primarily driven by continued actions we've taken to manage under the asset cap.
As I mentioned earlier, Wealth and Investment Management results exclude Wells Fargo Asset Management,
which is now reported in Corporate and prior periods have been revised. Net income declined 18% in the
business from the fourth quarter, revenue grew reflecting higher asset-based fees and higher retail brokerage
transactional activity. Expenses were up due to seasonally higher personnel expense.
Net income declined 8% from a year ago, reflecting the impact of low interest rates on net interest income partially
offset by the higher asset-based fees. We ended the first quarter with record client assets of $2 trillion, up 28%
from a year ago, reflecting strong market performance. Net flows into advisory accounts improved in the first
quarter from a year ago in the fourth quarter. Average deposits were up 19% from a year ago, and average loans
increased 4% from a year ago, largely due to customer demand for securities-based lending offerings.
Slide 16 highlights our Corporate results which included $1.2 billion of lower net interest income from a year ago,
primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates, offset by a $1.4 billion increase in non-interest income. First

quarter 2020 included equity impairments in our affiliated venture capital and private equity partnerships, and
results in the first quarter of 2021 included a $208 million gain on the sale of the student loans portfolio. Non-
interest expense declined from the fourth quarter on lower restructuring charges.
And we'll now take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess first one I wanted to ask about is on NII guidance.
So specifically in terms of premium amortization, there's about a $250 million delta between today's level of
premium and where it was a year ago. Does that â€“ last year's level of about $360 million or so, does that
represent in your mind a pretty typical level? And then kind of how quickly does it move back down to there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Hey, Scott, it's Mike. You know, I think you really got to remember what happened last year that would have
impacted premium amor, right, it was a bit of an abnormal quarter as you sort of got to the end of the quarter. I
think from here, I think based on what we're seeing, premium amort probably has peaked in the first quarter and
starts to trend down from here. How long it takes to sort of get to a kind of normalized view, I think we'll see over
the next â€“ we'll have a better clarity on that I think over the next couple quarters. But we would expect it to start
trending down from here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then just a separate question. So the lending recovery is kind of a big question for
you guys and others. I guess just regardless of what happens with industry trends, maybe if you could speak to
where you feel you guys are getting your fair share of loan growth and where you think you might still need to do
better. I know you had mentioned, for example, Credit Card as being very underpenetrated, but just curious to get
broader thoughts there as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, look. As what you'll probably hear from a lot of folks, the demand across really most commercial client
segments has been pretty weak now and probably has stabilized or seems to have stabilized over the last couple
of months. But I think we'll sort of see how that progresses into later this quarter. I think as we sort of look at
where the opportunity is, as the economy and the momentum in the economy really starts to take off more, it's
really across-the-board in our core client segments.
In our Middle Market, our Commercial Banking, more broadly I think there will be opportunity in kind of the core
large Corporate segment maybe to a lesser degree, but we do really expect to see that Commercial Banking
demand start to pick up as the economy picks up. And so I would sort of highlight that. I think Charlie has talked a

lot about the Credit Card space. I think there'll be growth there, but given sort of the relative size of our portfolio to
the balance sheet, I think that the impact there will be modest to the overall size of sort of our loan portfolio.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just wondering, Mike, if you can kind of just recodify that expense commentary for
the year. You said the $53 billion number and then you also talked about the revenue-related lift of about $800
million, so was that just the reset to [indiscernible] (00:34:24) all things equal? I just want to make sure we know
what that includes and doesn't include and how you expect it to traject from here. Thanks
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, sure. Ken, thanks for the question. So if you recall how we sort of set the $53 billion target, I'll just give you
a little bit of the background there that we covered last quarter. So embedded in that $53 billion target was an
increase of about $0.5 billion of revenue-related expenses, and about $1 billion of operating losses sort of
embedded in there. And what we excluded from there is the cost to exit the businesses, which we saw a little bit
this quarter, the $100 million or so this quarter for the student loans business and any restructuring charges that
come throughout the year.
So as you sort of think about the go-forward piece of it, the $53 billion, we still feel really good about, I think what's
putting a little bit of pressure on that is the incremental $300 million of revenue-related expense. So I don't think
it's a foregone conclusion that we're going to be $300 million higher, but I do think that's putting pressure on the
$53 billion. So it's possible we're a little over that if the revenue-related expenses hold, which by the way should
be a good thing, right. Because that means there's plenty of revenue on the other side of that to offset it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
And that was going to be my follow-up Mike, which is, was the revenue uplift what you had already seen in the
first quarter or is it things that you feel better about going forward that we haven't necessarily seen yet but you're
now anticipating a better revenue environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, we did see a little bit of it in the first quarter as equity markets outperformed I think everyone's expectations.
So if those market levels hold throughout the rest of the year, that's when you'll see the rest of that revenue-
related comp come in, and so you'll see the revenue associated with it throughout the rest of the year.

Okay. And then I'm sorry just last one on it, are you still expecting the end of year on expenses to be lower than
the beginning as you had said also in the fourth quarter? That trajectory still holds directionally?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, directionally that's right. We'll get more benefit from the efficiency initiatives that we're executing later in the
year, so that will sort of impact the run-rate. And I would just point out and remind people that we do have a lot of
seasonal expenses that hit the first quarter, and so you sort of need to normalize for those as you go out for the
rest of the year as well.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi. Good morning. My first question is a clarification question for Mike. Clearly, the market responded to this
comment, I think you noted that if loan growth was going to be â€“ continue to be tough this year, that NII would be
down 2% from annualized fourth quarter, which I think the market is taking that you're bringing in your NII guide
for the year. And I just wanted to make sure we had interpreted that correctly, that it seems like a more realistic
outlook for NII now with the curve steepening and perhaps green shoots on loan growth is flat-to-down 2%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. No, thanks, Erika for the question. Our guidance still holds that down, it's somewhere between flat to the
fourth quarter run-rate to down 4%. And consistent to what we said in the first quarter, to get to the top of the
range, we needed to see â€“ we need to see some loan growth. That's still the case, although rates have offset
some weakness that we've seen so far. And I think to get to kind of the middle of the range, we really need rates
to kind of hold where they are. And we won't need a lot of loan growth from here to hit that, but I think there's
plenty of scenarios that you can sort of think through that put you somewhere else in the range, but what we tried
to give you were a couple kind of realistic data points relative to where we think what's possible in terms of where
we'll land within the range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it, very helpful. And my second question is for Charlie. Charlie, clearly the market is reacting to what seems to
be a brighter revenue picture for Wells and continued progress in your transition and turnaround. And it feels like
it's shrugging off â€“ typically your stock wouldn't be up 3% after saying that expenses can flip higher and clearly
the market doesn't care given the revenue outlook. I guess I'm wondering as we look forward to 2021 and hearing
you loud and clear in some of the investments that you've already â€“ planning to make in the Consumer side, what
are the puts and takes in terms of a greater bottom-line benefit from the second half of that $8 billion of cost
savings that you've identified versus an economic picture that has clearly brightened even over the past three
months? In other words, should we think of your expenses having a higher floor, let's say $50 billion to $51 billion
as we look out to 2022? And obviously that would come with greater efficiencies as revenue continues to improve.

Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Okay. Thanks, Erika. Listen, I don't think there's anything more that we're going to say in terms of what we would
expect expenses to be going forward beyond what Mike covered in his remarks and what we've said on last
quarter. When we look at the opportunities to continue to drive efficiency in the company, which is really all about
just running a better company, those continue to be extremely significant. We laid out just on a gross basis what
we thought those opportunities were and our degree of confidence in being able to achieve that given the level of
specificity that we had and the line-of-sight, and I think that still holds true. And over time, we would expect to
continue to find more kind of peeling the onion back.
And at the same time, we are investing in the business and it's on the Consumer side, it's on data. It's across the
Home Lending platform, the Card platform, our products in the Consumer Bank, what we're doing in our Middle
Market business with technology account. I can go on and on of all of the things that we're doing. And so I think
that's all embedded in our statement that we would expect the fourth quarter, in order to get to $53 billion just
would clearly be a lower run-rate than the $53 billion itself. And then as we look forward, we hope to see net
expense reductions as we continue to drive efficiency while continuing to add investments into the business. So
hopefully that's responsive to what you were asking.

Hi, Betsy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I had a question around how you're thinking about the dividend and the buybacks. We know that post CCAR
stress test, assuming you pass that, that there's a little bit more room for you to do both of those things. So maybe
you could give us a sense as to how you would approach the buyback and the dividend decision post-stress test?
And in particular, what kind of timeframe are you thinking about that you would need to optimize the capital
structure down to your management targets? Because you're sitting with a lot of excess capital today, as you
know.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Sure. Mike, why don't I start and then you can pick up. I guess we'd start with the dividend. It's not lost on us that
our dividend is quite low, certainly relative to where we're earning today and as we look forward, and we all know
that's a consequence of two things. It's a consequence of the restrictions that were put in place by the Fed in
14


Wells Fargo & Co.
(WFC) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2021 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2021
terms of what those limitations were. But it was also a point of view that we had, which was we didn't want to have
to â€“ if the environment even would get worse from that point in time be in a position to have to reduce the
dividend again.
So we would like to increase the dividend to a more reasonable level. We think about it as targeting a payout ratio
excluding reserve releases and things like that. And then beyond that, it is investment in the business, it's
deploying our capital for our clients and the difference being buybacks ultimately just given the amount of excess
capital that we have today.
And Mike, you can talk a little bit about the timing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, and as you sort of think about timing, obviously we've got a lot of components to sort of think about there.
But you sort of think about it over the next year or so or year, I think that sort of gets you probably a reasonable
timeframe to sort of work our way down, assuming as we've been told that the restrictions come off and we're
back to sort of a more normal stress capital buffer regime. And so I would sort of think about it over that timeframe
Betsy, in terms of what the timing looks like...
[indiscernible] (00:44:12)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A

...CCAR and the results, and how that all plays out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And on the payout ratios, I mean the dividend had been on the higher end of the peer group but your peer
groups running somewhere between 30% and 40%, and that's I would think what you mean by reasonable. I'm
not asking you to tell me what ratio, but I guess I'm asking you, is that the right peer group or would you say you
should widen your aperture a little bit and go more like 25% to 40%, bring in some of the G-SIBs in there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, look I think as you sort of think about the payout ratio over time, I think we'll sort of come up â€“ and
obviously it's going to be a Board decision Betsy in terms of what the dividend trajectory sort of looks like, but it's
not lost on us that we need to sort of be in a reasonable sort of payout range over time. And obviously that's going
to be dependent upon what we think the earnings capacity is going to look like. And so I think you'll see that sort
of come through over time and as we sort of have more ability to distribute capital.

Yeah. And I guess what I'll just add, Betsy, just real quick is, I think the way the numbers and whatnot, the way
you talked about it is generally the right way to think about it in terms of how we number one, we were clearly high
relative to what others were and in terms of what we probably make sense for us, so that's not the way we're
thinking about it. More long-term range in terms of what I think you talked about is right, and you know we would
like to do something sooner rather than later. And that might not get us to where we ultimately want to be but it
would be I think an important step. That's the direction that we're going.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Good morning. Just on the margin front, I just wanted to see if you could quantify the impact of the hedge
ineffectiveness on the net interest margin this quarter. And then separately, could you just talk about margin
expectations from here, just given the rate backdrop [indiscernible] (00:46:41) looking at the bottom here and we
could see some upside as we move through the rest of the year? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, sure, John, it's Mike. The hedge ineffectiveness had about a 3 basis point impact on net interest margin.
And as you probably know, we'll get that back â€“ a negative 3 basis point impact, and we'll get that back over time.
These are â€“ hedge ineffectiveness is sort of a temporary difference that comes back. As you sort of look â€“ think
about the outlook from here, if the case that we sort of laid out that gets us to the top of our NII range plays out in
the way that underpins that, then we should see some growth in both NII and NIM from here. And so this
hopefully will be either bottom or pretty close to the bottom as you sort of look forward, if that case plays out. Now
as you know, NIM can move around a little bit quarter to quarter so you might have that bounce around, but the
general trajectory should be positive.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay. Got it, Mike. Thanks. And then last, separately on the cost save side, I know you expect about $1.5 billion
to fall to the bottom line of the $3.7 billion this year. Can you maybe help us think about the magnitude that can
fall to the bottom line of the remaining savings of the remaining $4.3 billion as received? Any additional color you
can provide this quarter now that you're beginning to peel the onion as you noted earlier? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. John, I would just go back to what we just talked about a few minutes ago. As you sort of think about the
trajectory of the expenses, we'll get more of that impact as we go throughout the year, and as Charlie just
16

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2021
mentioned, the run-rate as we go into the fourth quarter will be lower, at a lower rate. And as we sort of think
about the investments we need to make and also the additional efficiency initiatives that we vet and sort of are
working on, on top of what we talked about last quarter play out, we'll provide more guidance on that as we think
about 2022 when we get later in the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
And this is Charlie. I just want to add a couple of things if I can. First of all, I'll just remind everyone that we have a
tremendous amount of work to do on our control environment. And when you look at the consent orders and all
those things. And so, no one has asked about that and again there's really very little that we can say as I said in
my prepared remarks, but we have a lot of work to do. We're committed to spend whatever is necessary, and it is
a significant amount of money, and as we get into next year, we're not going to lock ourselves into a certain
number, because we have to spend what's appropriate. And so as we get closer we'll be in a better position to
give you more color, but given its three quarters away it just doesn't make any sense.
And I also just want to just remark, we are very focused on improving efficiency of the company, but the world is
moving really quickly. We have a lot of work to do in terms of building the businesses and putting ourselves in a
position so that we do create the kind of revenue growth that we would expect to be able to get out of this
franchise. And so that's just a reminder part of the reason why we're not being too specific about what we expect
beyond this year because as we continue to do our work and plan for the future, we need to have the ability to do
what's necessary to build the company for the long-term while we still said we still would expect expenses to be
down on a net basis as we look into the out years. But more to come as time goes on.

I think so on your â€“ the first point, I think when we look at these four businesses that we report publicly, we
generally believe that there are material growth prospects in all of them. All for very, very different reasons, and
so it's hard to sit here today and say whether one should be a little bit higher than the others, but I think we feel
great about the positions we have. We feel great about the opportunities in each. And so, I think that should be â€“

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. I think all the things that we have to do at this point are continuing to build out the products and services
that we have at the core of the franchise. I mean we are spending a significant amount of money, and I think
we've got a significant opportunity given the size of our Consumer footprint and in terms of what we should be
doing from a digital perspective. The way we kind of look at it internally is we're in the game, but we're not at all a
market leader in terms of what our digital capabilities are. We have a very, very clear roadmap about what we
intend to build out, and we would start to be bringing those things to market this year.
But as I said when we talk about what we're spending this year in that $53 billion, that is included in there. And
we've got opportunities like that across all of the businesses, so I think we're not in a position to buy anything at
this point. Our focus is on spending our money to strengthen what we have but still believe that there are material
opportunities to do that, some shorter-term, some longer-term.

Good morning. Just a long-term strategic question, trying to look past the asset cap and everything. As we think
about the investment bank, what is the vision for that longer-term? You've got a competitive advantage in the
SLR, which is becoming more and more evident with the Fed exemption going away. I think you're about 150
basis points above peers. Is there a way to better leverage that? And then, maybe if you could also comment on

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2021
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
So let me start. I think our aspirations in the â€“ for our Corp & Investment Bank, it's actually interesting because I
actually, other than the fact that we're not afraid to talk about it, I actually don't think about it being really all that
different from what we've been doing over the past bunch of years. When you look at our results, the Corporate &
Investment Bank is an extremely important part of the company. That's not because I declared anything
differently. All we did is we broke out the results so you actually saw the importance of it. A significant part of it is
the corporate bank, but the investment bank is a meaningful portion of it as well. And so, as we think about what it
should look like going forward, we want to continue to build out the Corporate & Investment Bank as we've been
doing in a very linear way, not in an exponential way, not moving beyond our risk appetite that kind of defines
what Wells Fargo is, but just by serving the existing customers that we have in those parts of the company in a
much more holistic way. And ultimately over a period of time that does allow you to expand your reach in terms of
what your client base is.
And so, we're focused on the products and services that our predominantly US customers want from us. We've
talked about the opportunities to penetrate the Corporate & Investment Banking products into the middle-market.
But it's true of â€“ there's significant opportunities in the large corporate market in the US where we've got
significant treasury management relationships, material lending relationships and we're completely under-
penetrated in terms of what fees are for those customers relative to â€“ at other institutions. So that's the way we're
thinking about it. And, again I would just stress. It's a continuation of building it out in a methodical way, not
focusing on using risk in order to grow share, but focusing on our customer relationships that we have because
we have a shot.
And just to be clear, on the equity piece that you're talking about, just remember, we do have an equity platform,
which you can see in our results. I would just describe in terms of a prime brokerage business because I'm sure
we'll get a question on it, so I'll just answer it now. Our exposure in total in our individual exposures, I would
describe as, just very consistent with the size of our platform. We manage it the way we â€“ in terms of risk, the way
we manage all the risks in the Corporate & Investment Bank. And I think we've seen the results over a period of
time there in terms of what that means, because it's not just what you do, it's how you do it.
And so, we did have a relationship with Archegos. We said publicly that we were always well-collateralized. We
exited it with all of our exposure with no loss. And I'll just add that we had substantial excess collateral after
liquidation. So it just says, again, in terms of the way we think about how we want to manage businesses that
have risk in it, not that we'll be perfect all the time. And as is the case in all events, the lessons to be learned both
in terms of what we've done and what others have done. And we'll factor that into how we manage the businesses
as we always would.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
And I would just add just one thing as you sort of think about our growth from here. We are a bit constrained in
growing our investment bank with the asset cap restrictions that we have in place, given the significant growth
that we've seen in consumer deposits in particular. So as you sort of think about that timeline and that approach,
Charlie said that'll take some time to sort of play out.

Just to reiterate that as we look at the actions that we've had to take to accommodate all the liquidity that we've
seen, the Corporate Investment Bank has beared the biggest brunt in terms of where we've actually gone to
create a bunch of that capacity. So as we think about the future, the first step is actually just getting back to where
we were. So...

Matt O'Connor Q

And then just to clarify the decline in equity trading year-over-year, is that just, if it wasn't from Archegos, is that
distortion from the retirement? There's just some noise I think related to that in a year-ago comp. Is that what's
driving that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
It's just activity levels in our business, and our business is a little bit different than others, a little bit smaller cash
business. That sort of I think drove a lot of activity this quarter. So I think there's a number of factors driving it, no
individual item that's significant.

Hi. Good morning. So why don't I start off with a question for Mike just on the fee income outlook. Lots of little
moving pieces in the quarter. But how should we be thinking about the appropriate jumping off point for core fee
income as we think about the completion of the business sales and maybe some normalization in IB and
mortgage activity? I know there's more explicit guidance that's been given on the NII side. I was hoping maybe
you could unpack how we should be thinking about that core fee income run rate from here pro forma the
completion of those sales.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. So, obviously, we've given you a lot of detail on those sales, so you can model in the impact that that's
going to have on fee income pretty easily. As you sort of think about some of the other big line items underneath
that, we had about $2.8 billion in the quarter for advisory and other asset-based fees primarily in our wealth
business, and as you sort of think about the key driver there, it's going to be equity market levels. And so you can
model what you think is going to happen there plus flows that may come in. As you said, another $1.3 billion in
the mortgage business. That is a bit cyclical as you sort of pointed out, but given what we see at this point for the
second quarter, we expect to have robust origination volumes in our business. And so that should be a good
quarter at least. And as rates continue to rise, you'll see some impact there in terms of volume impact there.
As you look at some of the other pieces, you've got deposit and lending fees just under a couple billion dollars
there too. I think those are pressured in the short run, but should see some normalization and growth over time.
You've got card fees, which should grow with economic activity. And then you've got another couple billion that's

kind of â€“ I'd kind of characterize as more transactional in nature whether it's commissions or investment banking
fees. And so I think if you sort of think about it that way, you can probably come up with a few drivers that sort of
help you model that in a way that gives you a view on where it's headed.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thanks for that color. And just for my follow-up on NII, maybe focusing on liquidity deployment, you guys are in a
very strong excess liquidity position. I know that a couple of quarters ago and I think, Mike, it was actually your
predecessor who alluded to the fact that your appetite was tepid to redeploy some of that excess into securities,
just given â€“ at that point in time, the curve was flat as a pancake. Now, that we've seen some incremental
steepening, was hoping you could speak to what's contemplated in the NII guidance in terms of excess liquidity
deployment and your appetite to actually grow the securities book from here, given your liquidity capacity to do
so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, no, as you point out we've got plenty of capacity and I think as you look at what happened in the quarter
kind of in a marginal way, a little under $10 billion, we've increased the portfolio. So we started to redeploy a bit of
it. But as you sort of point out, although the curve has steepened, rates are still relatively low and so we're
working to balance sort of the short-term carry we're going to get by redeploying faster with OCI impacts over time
and how to do this in the most effective way. And when we get good entry points, we're taking advantage of it. So
I would think that we're going to continue to redeploy at a prudent pace as we see opportunities that sort of make
sense from a not just the short-term carry view but also all the other items that we sort of need to take into
account as we sort of look forward.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul, you may be on mute.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Sorry about that. I was on mute. Mike, I believe you mentioned that the expenses or some of the expenses
associated with the Asset Management business and the Corporate Trust business will be sticky and will remain
for a bit. And we're talking about annual in 2020 about $1.7 billion in aggregate. What's still a little bit unclear to
me is in the $53 billion expense number, what proportion of that $53 billion or $1.7 billion is embedded in the $53
billion guide? And I guess as an adjunct to that, I guess, can you just talk about how sticky those expenses, what
proportion of those expenses will stick around? How do they roll off, over what time period? Because I guess,
what I'm a little bit sensitive to is with the sale of the three businesses, you're creating about a $2.3 billion revenue
hole, and just want to make sure that we understand that there's no notable impact on the expense base. So if
you can just help us unpack some of this stuff it would be helpful.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2021
Yeah, no, it's a good question. So as you sort of think about Corporate Trust and Asset Management, we assume
that those expenses would be here for the full year in the $53 billion. So there's no...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
...no savings assumed relative to the outlook we gave you, so that's sort of, I guess, point number one. On the
other parts of the question, what we were trying to point out is with both of these businesses, probably certainly
for the Corporate Trust business to maybe a greater degree, we'll have some transition services agreements as
they take on and migrate these businesses. So some of the expenses stay, some of that will get offset in other
items. But some of those expenses will stay as part of those agreements, so not everything transitions sort of day
one. That's sort of point number one.
Point number two on it is that, as you would expect, there's a portion of these expenses that are more shared
across the organization, I used sort of corporate overhead just as an example. So it'll take us a little longer to work
the majority of that out. And so I characterize that at somewhere between 10% and 20% of it will take a little bit
longer. And then, I guess, lastly, as we sort of get to closing on these deals, we'll be transparent and provide an
update to our guidance on how these will impact it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. But if we're thinking about 2022 in relation to the sort of the ongoing expense run-rate, which is reflected in
the $53 billion, really, the $1.7 billion â€“ I'm just looking at Asset Management and Corporate Trust, that the bulk of
that should by that point, assuming the deals close, should call it, I don't know, 80%, 90% of that should be out of
the run rate by next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2021
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Hey, Mike. Two quick clean-up items. Just on the tax rate, can you remind us what's making the tax rate low this
year and whether the reserve releases puts upward pressure on that? And then more importantly, what â€“ is it
sustainably low as you could look out into further years because of tax advantage investments? Or is part of it
profitability related? Just give us the factors there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, the biggest impact, John, on the tax rate relative to kind of the marginal rate that we've got is the impact we
get from the tax credits we get on our low income housing and renewable energy investments. And as you can
see from the K disclosures, those are â€“ those have been growing year after year. And they grew â€“ we expect
them to grow in 2021 as well. And those are what they are, right? There's no, those are pretty easy for us to
identify and forecast and that's the biggest piece of what's bringing down the effective tax rate. And those credits
will continue. Obviously, the more pre-tax income that we have above and beyond what we expect will sort of be
at the marginal tax rate. And so presumably, if we, obviously, theoretically, if we earn more money then you'll see
that effective tax rate sort of inch up over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. And then just on the mortgage outlook you mentioned.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Hey, John. This is Charlie. The only thing I would add on that is just, Mike, you can correct me. The reserve
releases affect the rate, but the size of our total tax number, not that big. Again, the substantial impact on the
lower rate is the dollar benefit that we get from these tax advantaged investments that we have. And as Mike said,
just on income going forward, think about it in terms of the marginal rate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Got it. So you're still expecting a single-digit tax rate this year, Mike? Correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, yeah, no. At this point, that's the case.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay. And then just to clarify on the mortgage outlook, Mike. I think you said like the industry might be down in
volume but you guys, you expect to buck that a little bit because of some of the retail strength you have. Or were
you kind of just saying that you'll be down a little bit but still robust? If you could just clarify your outlook on
mortgage, that would be great.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2021
Michael Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, look, the industry data typically their forecasts lag a little bit relative to what the industry is actually seeing.
And so I think the industry is projecting that second quarter is going to be down a little bit, but we'll see how that
sort of plays out over the coming weeks in terms of what their forecasts are. But I think based on what we're
seeing in our pipeline, we feel like it'll be a pretty robust quarter on the origination side. You're likely to see that
gain on sale margins come down, but we're likely to see an increase in volume as well.

John E. McDonald Q

Okay. Thank you.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi, Charlie, Mike, thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of clean-up ones, just a little bit further on
mortgage banking, Mike, since you just answered that partly. The question I have is, Ginnie Mae buyouts, you
talked about that boosting your mortgage banking gains. How much was that? And â€“ because then that could give
us a sense of what did your gain on sale margin do in Q1 versus Q4. And how much are you expecting that gain
on sale margin â€“ I'm sorry the Ginnie Mae buyouts to continue in the next couple of quarters? How much more to
do?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, I think, Vivek, I don't have the number in front of me on the impact from the buyouts but I would also sort of
point out, so we can follow up with you after but I would also point out that the early buyouts as we re-securitized
them, that impacts sort of our balance as well, sort of our loan balance in Home Lending. And so, I think that's
another big driver and we give you some data in the Qs in terms of what those balances look like, quarter-to-
quarter. So we would expect that over the coming quarters that we're going to continue to re-securitize more of
those loans.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then a second one for both of you. I saw the numbers on the expected gain on sale in the businesses,
well, the Asset Management and Corporate Trust. Is that net of goodwill or is that â€“ do we need to adjust the
goodwill write-down on that? And that'll, obviously, play into your share buybacks. And, Charlie, given that we're
all anticipating the asset cap to be lifted at some point, how are you thinking about the pace of share buybacks
since that'll give you an opportunity to put some of that capital to work in terms of growing the balance sheet too?
Don't worry, I'm not trying to pin you down on timing of asset cap getting lifted, but just...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. So, Vivek, I'll start there. So I don't want to get wonky on accounting, but the way we accounted for the
student loan business was the sale of the portfolio. And so, there was a goodwill write-down that showed
discretely in the P&L and how that flows through. As you sort of look at the Corporate Trust business sale and the
25


Wells Fargo & Co.
(WFC) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2021 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2021
Asset Management sale, you won't have a corresponding write-down of the goodwill. The gain's net of everything
that goes into exiting there. So you don't need to adjust for that. I think as it comes to sort of the asset cap
question, we'll go back to our stock answer around not, sort of not commenting on that at all other than the fact
that, as Charlie has said a couple times on the call, that we're â€“ it's our top priority and we're continuing to do
whatever we need to do to sort of work our way through that and we continue to believe we're making good
progress there. And as you sort of look at our capital and liquidity levels, we've got a significant â€“ continue to have
a significant amount of excess capital. So...

Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC

Operator: Our final question will come from the line of Charles Peabody with Portales.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles Peabody Q
Analyst, Portales Partners
Yeah. I had two questions. One on cards and one on NII. On the card front, you mentioned that you were
punching below your weight. And just curious, hearing from a lot of the card companies and JPMorgan this
morning that they're going to really accelerate their marketing spend on cards in the second half of the year. So
are you expecting to grow it? How are you expecting to gain market share? Is it pricing, awards? How are you
going to improve your relative position in that business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Sure. This is Charlie. Thanks for the question. First of all, I would say, again, kind of like my comments on the
Corporate & Investment Bank. When we think about the opportunity, we're not talking about doing anything that is
materially different from a risk perspective for the company. The way we look at it is, we have a business today,
which has $35-ish billion of receivables. When you look at the size of the consumer base that we touch across the
franchise, it's hugely substantial and we're hugely underpenetrated, even though we do have a reasonable size
business to start out with.
Ultimately, when you look at what we do as a card company, the fact is our card propositions are not competitive,
what is available today in the marketplace or where people are going. When we look at our things that we do on
fraud, when we look at our customer service, every step of the way, we think we have opportunities to make
material improvements in what our offerings look like, which will make our products far more attractive for those
that currently have the products, so that it becomes their primary product, but also more attractive for the
customers that we currently touch. And so, it's a very, very â€“ we're very, very clear about what we think we've got
to do to increase that penetration. In a lot of ways it's very, very basic because we're building on something which
is particularly uncompetitive, which I just look at like it creates great opportunity for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles Peabody Q
Analyst, Portales Partners
As a follow-up question on NII, I believe you guys have modeled scenarios per negative rates at the short end.
Can you share some of your findings on that?
