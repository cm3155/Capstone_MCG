President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Thanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony delivered strong financial results for the first quarter of
2022, including net earnings of $932 million or $1.77 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 4% and a
return on tangible common equity of 34.9%. This financial performance was driven by the core strengths of our
business and the continued execution of our key strategic priorities to drive greater value for our partners,
providers, and customers.
We continue to expand and diversify our portfolio during the first quarter with the addition or renewal of more than
15 partners. We also continue to extend our reach and engage more customers thanks to the powerful
combination of our seamless experiences, attractive value propositions, and broad suite of flexible financing
options. New accounts grew 10% during the first quarter, reaching 5.5 million, and average active accounts
increased 6%.
Turning to customer spend. We continue to experience broad-based demand across the many industries we
serve. Purchase volume increased 17% versus last year driven by double-digit growth in our Diversified & Value,
Digital, Health & Wellness, and Home & Auto platforms. We also continue to see higher engagement across our

portfolio as purchase volume per account grew 10% compared to last year. Customer spend reflected strong
cross-generational growth. Millennial and Gen Z spend increased 23% year-over-year, and Gen X and baby
boomer spend increased 15%.
The combination of strong purchase volume and a slight moderation in payment rate drove loan receivables
growth of 8% on a core basis. Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 42% of the purchase volume in the first
quarter and increased 29% from the prior year. On a loan receivables basis, including the loan receivables held
for sale, dual and co-branded cards accounted for 25% of the portfolio and increased 16% from the prior year.
In short, Synchrony has continued to see strong engagement across our customer base and momentum across
our product suite thanks to our ability to deliver flexible financing options that specifically address whatever our
customer's transactions may look like on any given day. Whether they're looking to cover a healthcare need,
purchase supplies for home repair or their simply convenience or value shopping, our customers can access
financing solutions that specifically address their needs while optimizing the value they seek.
Of course, in an ever-changing consumer landscape, the financing needs and expectations of customers evolve,
as do to the strategic priorities of our partners. To an increasingly greater degree, it's no longer simply about
reward points or cashback; it's also about delivering an end-to-end experience where the kinds of perks that
attract the customer to the product are designed to anticipate and optimize value. The more dynamic and data-
driven those experiences and the value propositions are, the deeper the customer relationship and the stronger
their lifetime value over time.
In order to deliver consistent and compelling outcomes for both our customers and partners, we consistently
invest in our digital capabilities, our product suite, and our value propositions so that we can continue to meet our
customers where, when, and however they want to be met. These investments take shape in a number of
different ways. Whether it's through loyalty, technology or marketing spend, our partners' interests are aligned
with ours so we structure the majority of our economic arrangements such that the investment and upside
opportunity are shared.
Synchrony's innovative digital capabilities allow us to deeply integrate with our partners and providers to deliver
seamless and engaging omni-channel experiences while also leveraging our data and insights to optimize
customer outcomes. In particular, we're often able to develop highly tailored value propositions to attract
customers for whom we can predict transaction behavior and financing needs, which ultimately leads to more
engaged and satisfied customers, higher spend, and better outcomes for all.
We're always looking for ways to enhance our program performance. Value proposition refreshes are a
particularly attractive and effective way to drive deeper engagement with existing customers and attract new
customers, resulting in higher lifetime value of each account. We have far more data and insights to leverage
based on our experience with an existing portfolio. And since our partner's interests are aligned with ours, the
investment costs are generally shared. Simple program enhancements like deeper integrations, more relevant
and universal value propositions, and greater product flexibility enable us to deliver greater and more utility and
value to our customers and stronger results for our partners.
Our customers receive greater financial flexibility to address their broad range of needs and make smarter
purchases while also maximizing the rewards they care about. And our partners attract new customers and drive
greater customer loyalty, larger ticket sizes, and more frequent transactions. Our partnership with PayPal is a
great example of how together, we continue to evolve and enhance our offerings to drive still greater outcomes for
all. Earlier this month, we announced the launch of our new and refreshed co-branded PayPal Cashback credit

card. The consumer value proposition is a best-in-class cashback offering where the consumer will earn unlimited
3% cashback when paying with PayPal at checkout, and 2% everywhere else Mastercard is accepted. The card
has no annual fee, no category restrictions, and can be added to the digital wallet for easy, fast, and secure check
out.
We're excited about this opportunity as it delivers exceptional consumer value while leveraging the innovative
digital experiences from previously launched partner programs to deliver a truly seamless and elegant customer
experience. In particular, the PayPal card experience will be fully integrated with the PayPal app and powered by
native APIs. Customers will be able to apply for the card and service their accounts all within the app as well as
receive personalized notifications and alerts to manage their credit account. Thanks to our integration within the
PayPal app, customers will be able to redeem their rewards into their PayPal balance to use for future purchases
or transfer into their PayPal savings account powered by Synchrony Bank.
The roll out of the new product, enhanced experience, and value proposition began earlier this month, and we
expect it to be fully deployed this quarter. Given the level of integration and functionality we're launching with this
card as well as the best-in-class value proposition we're delivering, we expect to see meaningful growth in new
accounts and spend on the card. We're truly excited to continue to raise the bar by consistently investing in and
delivering innovative financing experiences for our partners and customers.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss the first quarter financial performance in greater detail.

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony's first quarter performance reflected continued strength
across our diversified sales platforms and, in particular, the powerful combination of our digitally powered product
suite, seamless customer experiences, and compelling value propositions which resonate deeply with the needs
of our customers and partners.
We generated over $40 billion of purchase volume in the first quarter of 2022, reflecting a 17% increase
compared to last year. From a platform perspective, our Home & Auto, Diversified & Value, Digital, and Health &
Wellness platforms each continue to experience double-digit year-over-year growth in purchase volume, reflecting
strong demand for both our products and attractive partner and provider networks.
At the platform level, Home & Auto purchase volume was 10% higher due to the continued strength in home and
improvement in auto as more consumers return to the road. In Diversified & Value, purchase volume increased
25% driven by strong retailer performance and higher customer engagement. The 20% year-over-year increase in
Digital purchase volume generally reflected the growth across the platform. We experienced greater customer
engagement, including higher active accounts and higher spend per active among our more established
programs, and continue momentum in our new program launches. The 17% increase in Health & Wellness
purchase volume was driven by broad-based strength led by dental given the benefit of increases in patient
volume compared to the prior year. Our Lifestyle platform generated purchase volume growth of 4%, reflecting
strong retailer sales and growth in music and specialty, partially offset by the ongoing impact of inventory
shortages in power and particularly strong growth in the prior-year period.
Loans grew 8% year-over-year to $83 billion, including loan receivables of $78.9 billion and held-for-sale
receivables of $4 billion. At the platform level, year-over-year loan growth rates accelerated from the fourth
quarter as strong purchase volume and some easing in payment rates contributed to balance growth.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2022
Net interest income increased 10% to $3.8 million, primarily reflecting a 7% increase in interest and fees due to
higher average loan receivables. On a sequential basis, first quarter payment rate was down approximately 25
basis points to 18.1% but was still approximately 45 basis points higher than last year and approximately 225
basis points higher than our five-year historical average. As we progress through the first quarter, payment rate
declined to 17.2% in February but increased in March, reflecting normal seasonality associated with the tax
refund season. That said, March was the first month where payment rate was lower versus the prior year since
the pandemic began in 2020.
Net interest margin was 15.8% in the first quarter, a year-over-year increase of 182 basis points. The primary
driver of this NIM expansion was a 6.5% increase in the mix of loan receivables relative to total interest-earning
assets due to the growth in average receivables and lower liquidity. This accounted for 126 basis points of the
year-over-year increase in our net interest margin. In addition, the first quarter's 32-basis point improvement in
loan yield and 33-basis point reduction in interest-bearing liabilities cost each contributed 26 basis points of NIM
improvement.
RSAs were $1.1 billion in the first quarter and 5.41% of average receivables. The $115 million year-over-year
increase was primarily driven by the continued strong performance of our partner programs. Provision for credit
losses was $521 million, an increase of 56% versus last year due to lower reserve release that was partially offset
by lower net charge-offs in the first quarter 2022. Included in this quarter's provision was a reserve release of $37
million, inclusive of the reserve reduction from our held-for-sale portfolios of $29 million. Excluding the impact of
our held-for-sale portfolios, the $8 million reserve release reflected an improvement in our loss forecast and credit
normalization trends based on continued strong performance, partially offset by an uncertain macroeconomic
environment.
Other income decreased $23 million, primarily reflecting higher loyalty cost due to purchase volume growth. The
year-over-year comparison was also adversely impacted by lower investment gains from our ventures portfolio.
Other expenses increased 11% to $1 billion due to the impact of higher employee, marketing, and business
development and technology costs. Other expense also included the impact of $10 million related to certain
employee and legal matters. Our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 37.2% compared to 36.1% last year.
In total, Synchrony generated net earnings of $932 million or $1.77 per diluted share during the first quarter. We
also generated a return on average assets of 4% and return on tangible common equity of 34.9%. These strong
net earnings and returns demonstrate the power and efficiency of our digitally enabled model combined with the
compelling value of the financial products and services we offer through our financial ecosystem. Not only were
we able to support our strong customer demand with a diverse range of products, but we were able to do so while
maintaining cost discipline and strong risk-adjusted returns.
Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on slide 9. Elevated payment rates continue to drive year-over-year
improvement in our delinquency metrics. Our 30-plus delinquency rate was 2.78% compared to 2.83% last year,
and our 90-plus delinquency rate was 1.30% compared to 1.52% last year. When removing the impact of the
held-for-sale portfolios on our delinquency measures for the quarters of this year and last year, the 30-plus
delinquency metric would've been down about 15 basis points versus 5, and the 90-plus metric would be down
about 30 basis points instead of 22.
Our portfolio's strong delinquency trends have continued to drive year-over-year improvements in our net charge-
off rate which was 2.73% compared to 3.62% last year, an 89-basis point improvement year-over-year primarily
reflecting a very healthy consumer and a 45-basis point higher payment rate. The 36-basis point sequential
increase from our fourth quarter net charge-off rate of 2.37% primarily reflected the impact of approximately 25-

basis point sequential decline in the payment rate as some consumers continue to revert back towards pre-
pandemic payment behaviors. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.96%, up
20 basis points from the 10.76% in the fourth quarter.
Let's focus on some key trends that have supported our strong performance and the confidence we have in our
business. First, as we just discussed, the underlying trends within our portfolio are performing better than our
expectations heading into the year. Our portfolio payment trends continue to show gradual normalization across
the credit spectrum, reflecting the strength of the consumer more broadly. In addition, the population of customers
within our portfolio that are now in post-expiration forbearance programs from other lenders has performed better
than our expectations. This suggests to us that with the benefit of excess savings due to stimulus, modified
spending behaviors, and widespread forbearance, these borrowers managed their personal balance sheet well
through the pandemic and, therefore, have a lower probability of default.
According to data from [indiscernible] (00:17:06), two-thirds of consumers have either only spent a portion of their
stimulus or have the entire amount of stimulus they received still saved. The remaining third of consumers have
spent the entirety of the cash stimulus they received during the last two years. When tracking consumer balance
trends by tiers, $0 to $2,500, $2,500 to $5,000, and balances greater than $5,000, the [indiscernible] (00:17:31)
data indicates that while all balance tiers of stimulus-receiving customers have seen balance declines between
$200 to $300 from peak levels observed last fall, the two higher tiers continue to show growth in their savings
balances since the third stimulus check. The lower tier with balances of $2,500 or less has generally remained
flat, aside from the stimulus checks over the last two years.
Meanwhile, labor markets continue to be robust as unemployment levels declined and wage growth continues.
Through mid-April, consumer spending continues to be strong, reflecting broad-based spend across our platforms
and products. Finally, our portfolio is well-positioned to navigate changing market conditions given its inherent
diversification across spend categories, financing options and channels, and customer demographics.
Synchrony's sales platforms encompass a broad range of discretionary and non-discretionary industry through a
wide network of distribution channels. More than a quarter of our purchase volume in 2022 came from each of our
Diversified & Value, Home & Auto, and Digital platforms. Another 8% of purchase volume came from Health &
Wellness, and almost half of our [indiscernible] (00:18:39) spend in 2022 was comprised of bill pay, discount
store, drug store, healthcare, grocery and non-grocery food, and auto and gas spend.
In addition, our disciplined approach to driving consistent growth and attractive risk-adjusted returns means that
our portfolio credit mix remains balanced and favorably positioned compared to the mix in the first quarter of
2020. At the end of the first quarter of 2022, approximately 40% of our balances represented super-prime
customers, another 35% came from prime, and the remaining 25% came from non-prime. And in terms of
average credit line by credit segment, our portfolio's super-prime, prime, and non-prime lines are still lower by an
average of 8% compared to two years ago.
Moving on to another Synchrony strength, our funding, capital, and liquidity. Deposits at the end of the first
quarter were $63.6 billion, an increase of $814 million compared to last year. Our securitized and unsecured
funding sources declined by $1.8 billion. This resulted in deposits being 83% of our funding compared to 81% last
year, with securitized funding comprising 8% of our funding sources and unsecured funding comprising 9% at
quarter-end. Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $17.8 billion which equated to 18.7% of our
total assets, down from 29.2% last year.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2022
As a reminder, before I provide the details of our capital position, it should be noted we elected to take the benefit
of the CECL transition rules issued by the joint Federal banking agencies. The impact of CECL has already been
recognized in our income statement and balance sheet. This transitional adjustment pertains strictly to our
regulatory capital metrics. To that end, the first year phase-in of the impact of CECL on our regulatory capital
results in the reduction of our CET1 ratio of approximately 60 basis points in the first quarter.
We ended the quarter at 15.0% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 240 basis points below last year's level of
17.4%. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 15.9% under the CECL transition rules compared to 18.3% last year. The total
capital ratio decreased 250 basis points to 17.2%, and the Tier 1 capital plus reserve ratio on a fully phased-in
basis decreased to 24.5% compared to 28.7% last year.
We continue our track record of robust capital returns to shareholders. In the first quarter, we returned $1.1 billion
to shareholders through $967 million of share repurchases and $114 million of common stock dividends. Even
when factoring in the roughly 180 basis points of remaining CECL transition impacts on our capital ratios over the
next three years, Synchrony still has considerable excess capital on our balance sheet to deploy in order to get to
our 11% CET1 target ratio. This, coupled with the meaningful earnings and capital generation of our business,
thanks to our disciplined approach to growth at appropriate risk-adjusted returns means that Synchrony is
particularly well-positioned to execute our capital plan as guided by our business performance, market conditions,
and subject to our capital plan and regulatory restrictions.
As part of our capital plan, the board has approved a 5% increase in our common dividend, bringing it to $0.23
per share beginning the third quarter of 2022. In addition, our board has approved an incremental share
repurchase authorization of $2.8 billion for the period ending June 2023. Inclusive of the remaining $251 million
authorization we had in March 31, this brings our total share repurchase authorization to $3.1 billion.
Finally, let's turn to our updated outlook for the full year which is summarized on slide 12 of our presentation. We
have assumed that the pandemic remains well-controlled, that any rise in cases will not have a material impact on
the economy or our customers. Our macroeconomic scenarios include a minimum of five interest rate increases
during 2022, qualitative tightening measures starting in the second quarter, a slowing economy resulting from
these actions, and continued higher inflationary conditions. While the macroeconomic environment is uncertain,
given the dynamics of the portfolio as we see them today, we do not anticipate a material impact on our full year
2022 outlook for loan receivables and credit performance.
We expect consumer demand to remain robust, supporting broad-based purchase volume growth across the
various industries and markets we serve. As consumer savings begin to decline and payment rate moderates [ph]
while on a lag (00:23:39), we would expect purchase volume growth to moderate as the year progresses. Given
the strong purchase volume and loan receivables growth we have achieved, we expect ending loan receivables
growth of approximately 10% versus the prior year. To the extent that payment rate moderates further, we would
anticipate purchase volume to moderate and loan growth to accelerate.
We expect our net interest margin to be between 15.25% and 15.50% for the full year. As we move through the
year, NIM will be impacted by the fluctuation in the percentage of average loan receivables to average earning
assets due to the impacts of seasonal growth, portfolio conveyances, and the timing of funding. As mentioned
earlier, our NIM outlook also reflects the anticipated impact of rising benchmark rates as well as rising interest and
fees which will be partially offset by higher reversal as credit normalizes.
In terms of credit performance, we expect a rise in delinquency and loss from current levels. For the full year
2022, we expect net charge-offs to be less than 3.50%. Based on the performance we've seen across the

portfolio, we now expect the portfolio to reach our mean annual loss rate of 5.5% until 2024, unless significant
changes in the macroeconomic environment develop. Of course, as credit normalization continues to take shape,
we expect interest and fee yields to increase. As charge-offs peak, this growth in interest and fees will be partially
offset by peak reversals. We expect reserve builds in 2022 to be generally asset-driven.
RSA expense will continue to reflect the strength of our program performance and purchase volume growth but
should begin to moderate as net charge-offs rise. For the full year, we expect the RSA as a percentage of
average loan receivables to be between 5.25% and 5.50%. As a reminder, we anticipate the Gap and BP portfolio
conveyances to occur in the second quarter, producing a non-recurring gain on sale of approximately $130
million. We expect to completely offset this gain through increased investments or incurring certain discrete items
and, thus, be EPS-neutral for the full year. Included in this quarter was $10 million of certain employee and legal
matters, leaving approximately $120 million of the incremental costs remaining for the full year. In terms of other
expense, we continue to expect the [ph] quarter's (00:26:09) levels to be approximately $1.05 billion. This outlook
excludes the impact of the $130 million gain on sale we're reinvesting or incurring in our business.
We remain committed to delivering positive operating leverage. To the extent that receivables and revenue
growth is not tracking ahead of expense growth for the full year, we'll moderate our spending where appropriate
while still prioritizing the best long-term prospects for our business. An example of such an opportunity might be
through fewer workforce additions or reducing other discretionary spend. So, to conclude, Synchrony is operating
from a position of strength as we progress through 2022. We're confident in our business's ability to deliver
sustainable, attractive risk-adjusted growth even if the market conditions change. Our innovative customer
experiences, compelling value propositions, and flexible product offerings are resonating across the diverse
industries, partners, and customer demographics we serve.
Our sophisticated cycle-tested underwriting as well as our deep domain experience of lending and servicing at
scale mean that the predictive power of our credit decisioning and account management capabilities will continue
to support the stability of Synchrony's target loss range. Finally, our RSA functions as an economic buffer. As
interest and fees rise with credit normalization and receivables growth, the RSA absorbs the impact of both rising
net charge-offs and a large proportion of any increases in growth-oriented costs. These factors enable Synchrony
to deliver consistent results with peer-leading range of risk-adjusted returns over time.
I'll now turn the call back over to Brian for his closing thoughts.

Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks. Brian, wanted to kind of just follow-up on the net interest margin guidance. Obviously, on a year-
over-year basis, there's a big change in the mix of earning assets, and you kind of alluded to the fact that that
might be normalizing. So, is there a way to relate the 10-ish percent growth in loans to growth in net interest
income in dollars? In other words, how much of that expected decline from current levels on the margin is more
about asset mix than it is about other factors? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Thanks and good morning, Moshe. Yeah, so I would expect, and I think the way Brian and I and the leadership
team are managing the business is that we would like to see asset growth come through in NII, right? So, the
biggest wildcard then after would be the interest expense piece. So, we would expect that from a dollar basis it
would track at least on the top line revenue. And then again, I highlighted a little bit of the timing relative to some
of the funding cost changes that we'll have in place. And you're right, one of the bigger wildcards will be ALR as a
percent of average earning assets which was at a little bit higher mark than we usually run at 85% during the first
quarter; it usually runs at a point or two lower than that. But again, it should track on a dollar basis at least on the
revenue side back to asset growth.

the outlook from unemployment remaining pretty strong here, just maybe outside of a recession, can you just talk

about what you see as the drivers of normalization? And are you seeing any impact from inflation on your
customer's spending habits? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, thank you. Thanks, Ryan. So, first, when you think about credit, the biggest thing for us as we entered the
year was the large portion in our book of customers who had received forbearance at other institutions and how
those customers would play out off forbearance. Again, we look back to the performance we had for folks that
were on forbearance with us. We obviously understood if you did not have forbearance with us, and you look at
this population of people, as we looked over the last four months, the performance of that was significantly better
than our expectation. So, we watch that develop. We also watch how our vintage post the refinements we made
beginning of last year developed, and we became more confident that we would not see what I would call a faster
credit normalization which reflected in a slower glide back to our mean loss rate out in 2024. So, that's really how
credit developed. Again, as we sit here in the first couple of weeks in April, we haven't seen anything that would
most certainly change that view.
I'll go to your last point about inflation and the customer. The customer is really starting at a point of strength.
They absolutely have excess liquidity, and we demonstrated that or at least indicated that with higher savings
rates. Our credit delinquency and how it sits today, average balances all are in great shape [indiscernible]
(00:33:05) and you have low employment. So, we look at the customer today. When you look at purchase
behavior pattern, we see small evidences of inflation inside of our book but not really significant. So, if you looked
at a category like gasoline, our average transaction value on gasoline is up 22% year-over-year, so you clearly
see the effect of inflation there. But in some respects, we don't see other parts of inflation. So, look at grocery.
Grocery for us, average transaction value is flat-over-year, flat sequentially every month during the quarter. But
frequency is up a little bit, so that tells you the consumer is being able to manage their spend within – inside of
that category. We see a little bit in apparel but the rest, we have not seen any dramatic impacts from inflation as
we move forward.
And to address your middle point on unemployment. Again, we look at unemployment. It's obviously stronger than
we had anticipated during the year. It continues to remain strong. There's more jobs that are outstanding. I think
most certainly with continued strength in the unemployment market, we obviously believe that the credit forecast
we put out both for this year and for next year will remain intact. Thanks, Ryan.

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2022
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Could you unpack a little bit the loan growth acceleration that you got in Digital and help us understand how much
of that is coming from the new cards you have out there, PayPal, Verizon, etcetera; the new offerings, the
refreshed offerings on PayPal and other drivers of that and contrast it with Home & Auto which maybe
decelerated a bit? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Sure, Betsy. I'll start on that. I'd say look, generally, Digital is a platform that we clearly expect to outpace
the rest of the business in terms of growth rate. We're definitely seeing that. A big chunk of that is obviously
attributed to Venmo and Verizon. Both of those programs continue to perform really well. Still believe those will be
top 10 programs for us in the future. We're getting great, both qualitative as well as quantitative feedback on both
in terms of the experience, the val prop, etcetera. There's really nothing inside the Digital numbers this quarter for
the PayPal launch that just happened, but we're really excited about that as well. I think that's going to be a terrific
offering. It's really two parts. First, the val prop we think is best-in-class; it's going to be a top-of-wallet card for
folks. And then, I would say the other thing that we did is we really launched probably our most sophisticated
technology stack in terms of how we're integrating inside of the PayPal app so the experience is really fantastic.
So, again, I think Digital will continue to outpace the rest of the business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
I think just to add on, Betsy, for the Home & Auto piece. When you look at that platform, auto is clearly improving.
It came off of a low last year, so that's obviously a positive trend. With regard to inside home, there's a little bit of
continued softness in the furniture portion of home which, again, is a little bit more of the inventory backlogs
clearing out. Again, we bill when furniture is delivered, so we expect that to continue to be a headwind here for the
next quarter or two hopefully as the inventory and supply chains clear up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
I think this is also the benefit of having a really diversified business. We're seeing really strong growth in Digital,
really strong growth in Health & Wellness, and that's a little bit immune in terms of impact from supply chain and
other things if you think about Health & Wellness and the backlog that those providers are working through. So,
again, I think it speaks to the benefit of having a very diversified portfolio.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Hi, Sanjay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Obviously, the drum beat on macro weakness is increasing since we last spoke. And I know, Brian Wenzel, you
talked about all the statistics that make you comfortable on the state of the consumer. I'm just thinking about the
reserve posture. You guys are pretty well above sort of where you were CECL day one. Maybe if you could just
talk about how you accounted for the macro environment at the time CECL day one was set and then where we
are today because at some point, we're going to migrate back down to CECL day one if losses remain well below
those levels, correct?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, and good morning, Sanjay. So, the way I would think about our reserve position today versus CECL
adoption, again, our mean loss rate has not changed from that 5.5% target. So, at the end of the day, it's really
the loss forecast that gets you in that reasonable supportable period, and then potentially any overlays. So, I think
when you look at it today for us, if you were solely to look at the macroeconomic conditions, Sanjay, it would tell
you that your coverage ratio will be down versus day one, right? One of the things that we still have is qualitative
overlays both for some [ph] OFAS (00:38:28) relief that we talked about as well as we have some macroeconomic
uncertainty as it relates to Ukraine and a higher inflationary environment that kind of just keeping the reserves
slightly higher than the day one.
Again, I think where we sit today is we will hopefully migrate back to that day one, certainly as I think the
inflationary pressures and the global geopolitical uncertainty clears, and that reserve builds here in the coming
months will really be more growth-oriented. So, again, absent mix, we still view we're going to migrate back to that
day one CECL rate. But again, we're trying to account for some of the uncertainties that exist in the marketplace.
Thank you, Sanjay. Have a good day.

John Hecht Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
I guess one question. Any discussions with the partner pipeline or any major partnership renewals as we go
through this year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Look, I would say we've got a very strong pipeline across all five of the platforms. If I look at it today, it
tends to skew a little bit more towards startup programs and opportunities like that as well as I would say
distribution partnerships and opportunities as well for our products. There isn't as much out there with the
exception of maybe one or two that are large existing programs, but we'll obviously get a look at those as well as
they come up in the next year or two. And then, I think for us, we're actively renewing our programs. We don't
have anything significant of size coming up in the next few years, but we're always in discussions with our
partners about what kind of changes can we make to drive even better performance and can we do that in the
context of renewals.
So, our teams are actively working those opportunities where they exist. But, generally, I feel like we've got a
pretty good pipeline and we're well-positioned. We're also getting a lot of good traction on the product suite and I
think the benefits of having an integrated product suite. So, as we're out there competing, I think that's a real
differentiator for us, too.

On the PayPal cashback card refresh, I guess my question is do you expect the same amount of [ph] revolve
(41:12) to drop or do you expect that to be a little more transactor? And I guess Brian Doubles, do you feel like
the integration here is pretty deep? Does that make the relationship stickier in terms of sort of renewal-type risk
longer-term?

Q1 2022 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2022
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. So, look, I'd start by saying we're really excited about the launch of the new value proposition and the new
experiences out of the app. I think it's going to be a game-changer. PayPal is excited about it, so are we. I would
tell you that these opportunities that we have to relaunch the val prop, it does drive a lot of traffic, a lot of new
accounts, a lot of spend. And I think with a val prop like this, it will definitely be a top-of-wallet card. We had a
good val prop before, but this is incremental, so we're really excited about it.
And I would tell you on your integration question, Don, absolutely. I think that our goal is for our integration to be
absolutely seamless to the customer. And we started doing this years ago with SyPI; now we're leveraging our
API stacks. And I can tell you, when you're inside the PayPal app, the Venmo app, you don't know what was
something that was developed by PayPal or something that was developed by Synchrony; it's just completely
seamless. You never know, you never have to step outside of the app, you never get kicked to a website; it's
100% integrated and completely seamless. So, that's our goal. We don't necessarily focus on how does that
impact the renewal down the road; we're really focused on just how do we deliver the absolute best experience
we can for a PayPal customer, a Venmo customer, etcetera. So, we're very excited to have this launched and
look forward to seeing how it does.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning, Brian – I guess both Brians – and Kathryn, and thank you for taking my questions. Wanted to just
go back to payment rates for a second. We saw a pretty big moderation in March. Maybe you can just talk a little
bit about that. I guess, what made the payment rates go from up 140 basis points year-over-year to down 50
basis points? The reason I just asked about March is that's when we started seeing a lot more conversation
around inflation, higher gas prices starting to have an impact. So, was that a consumer thing? Was that as you
expected? Is there something else about the year-over-year comp we should be keeping in mind? Anything
there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. First of all, thank you, Mihir, for the question. So, again, there's a little bit of timing related to tax refunds
that plays out. So, clearly, there was some faster refunds that were paid out in February versus March. If you look
at the overall tax refund season, right, your average refund is ahead of last year – I want to say 13% – and the
dollars are probably [ph] $14 million (00:44:11) ahead. So, we think that had probably a little bit of disproportional
effect in February. We also think as we watch consumer behavior patterns, we've indicated to you we have seen
portions of the portfolios in cohorts that have decelerated pay rates beginning in the latter part of 2021, and that
has continued into 2022.
When we look at it, I know we get a lot of questions with regard to credit grades. Inside of that, are you seeing it in
any one particular place inside the portfolio? If I look at March alone, so just March alone, the deceleration in the

payment rate happened across all credit grades, so it's not at the lower end. And actually, the largest percentage
of deceleration happened in the prime segment, so it's not a sub-prime issue relative to inflation. And I think when
you also look at, the – again, we also talk quite a bit about people who pay their statement balances, their
minimum payments were in the middle. We've obviously seen the folks in the middle decline but go equally up
into full pays and down into minimum pays.
So, again, it really says this is across the board and we don't necessarily think it's inflation-driven but part of I
think the migration that we anticipated back on payment rate back to the mean that we anticipate. The exact
timing of which we're not 100% sure of but, again, we're starting to see that turn. So, thank you, Mihir.

Operator: From JPMorgan, we have Rick Shane. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thanks. Good morning. When we look at the operating expenses and talk about the incremental reinvestments in
2022, I'm curious should we see that as a run rate or should we see the $120 million that you have remaining
through the rest of the year as sort of one-time or incremental as we think about numbers going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Great, great. Thanks for the question. It will be one-time expenses. We had the $10 million in the first quarter that
related to some employee-related reductions. I think as you step into the second quarter, again, we'll detail this
out. You'll see some further reductions in some of our physical footprint and structural cost inside the business.
You'll see some incremental dollars that are put into marketing to really accelerate growth, and that will be one-
time in nature. So, I would not anticipate it to be an ongoing expense. Again, what we're trying to do is take the
one-time gain, really reinvest it back into the business either to reduce structural costs or accelerate growth. So, it
should be a net-zero for this year and not comp into next year but hopefully help the growth. Thank you.

Operator: From Piper Sandler, we have Kevin Barker. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kevin J. Barker Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thank you for taking my questions and good morning. I would like to go back to your comments about NIM and
the expectations for deposit costs. Deposit costs are higher in the previous rate cycle versus today, but your
balance sheet is much more deposit fundamentally than it was previously. So, it seems like structurally, you
should have a slightly better liability structure in this rate cycle. I was hoping maybe you can just dig a little bit
deeper on your expectations for deposit betas in this cycle versus the previous cycle and your expectations for
overall funding costs just given the uncertainty around rates and inflation.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah, great question. So, when we look back to the kind of previous cycle on previous rate increases, again, we
were really growing our deposit book which we started back in, call it, the early 2010 to 2015 range, so we're
accelerating growth in the bank. And given the fact that we were a newly separated company, there was some
higher costs that were embedded in there. I think you are right, we have shifted from probably a mid-70s percent
deposit composition of the funding stack to at least low 80s, now mid-80s. Potentially, I think we're 83% this

quarter, so that is going to provide a benefit. There's going to be some rotation. I think as you see interest rates
rise here, a lot of folks have gone into savings versus CDs. In the short run, that could have some negative
impact. Over the long run, getting people locked into CDs in this environment is a better alternative for us. So, we
look at that as being over the long-term a good thing if I can get people into term-related savings products.
I think when you think about betas, if you look where we are so far today with the first 25-basis point movement,
less than half of that, if you call it that, has already manifested itself in our high-yield savings rates. Depending
upon the tenor, essentially it's been 100%. But we've really been trying to raise deposits because our growth rate
of being targeted at that approximately 10%, we want to get ahead of some of the funding-related matters. So, it's
going to be a little bit around what competition does in the marketplace. But again, it could be slightly higher than
previous cycles. But again, people have been slower to react so far into the environment. And again, I think the
higher deposit mix will be very beneficial for us as we think about NIM moving forward. Thank you.

Q
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, I guess, on slide 12, you guys mentioned the annual loss rate won't hit the
mean until 2024 unless significant macro changes. Can you sort of just quantify what comprises some of these
changes? I just sort of want to get a sense on how you're thinking about downside scenarios. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. When you think about our loss rate, the biggest variable that drives loss in a recession or any other
environment is unemployment. And what's going to be different I think as people think about the macroeconomic
backdrop is that you're coming from incredibly low unemployment and you really have built-up savings in the
prime and super-prime segment. So, when you traditionally think about a credit normalization or an increase in
your loss expectation, it's driven off of unemployment, number one; and then two, in the prime segment, it really
goes into people that struggle, that have higher exposure at default.
So, I think as we look at it going forward, because you have such low unemployment; you have more jobs than
you have today; up until now, albeit not necessarily offsetting inflation, a rising hourly wage, that buffers some of
the unemployment pressure that you would see in the loss rate, and the excess savings that you have would
buffer some of the lost content that you'd see in the prime segment. That's what gives us probably greater comfort
that there's more of a glide even in this slightly difficult scenario. The scenario where macroeconomics changes is
you do have a rapid rise in unemployment and you have a very fast depletion in savings rates in the prime
customers could dictate a higher loss rate over that horizon. Thank you [indiscernible] (00:51:22).

Q
Good morning. On the payment rate expectation, I know you flagged the decline that you saw in March which is
encouraging. Can you maybe talk about your confidence in sustainable decline there on the payment rate front?
And then, on the flipside, I appreciate the color you gave on the delinquencies and at least some of the
progression on credit by customer segmentation. Are you seeing any stress at all in the lower income bands that's

noteworthy here because we're hearing about some payment issues at the lower income at other payment
providers out there? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian J. Wenzel Sr. A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Let me deal with your latter question with regard to the lower credit. We're not seeing, as you refer to it,
pressure. We see normalization that's happened on payment rate as on entry rate and delinquency flows but not
pressure. So, I know there are other some sub-prime issuers out there that have pressure. They have been more
aggressive really going out during the, I'd call it the middle part of the pandemic to open the origination or credit
box for them. We obviously didn't do that, so we're not seeing incremental pressure. We're seeing more what I
would say normalization back to a pre-pandemic level related to that lower credit quality.
With regard to payment rate, and this is something we monitor closely, we monitor in lots of different ways. Credit
grade is one; we look at different aspects inside of it. We look at who's paying, call it, statement balances; min
pays, between that. Again, we're following a trend. It appears to be moving in the right direction. The exact slope
here, we have to get through the tax return season here which will be April. And then, we'll begin to see how the
consumer continues to react. Again, they're spending very healthily across the industry, right, relative to credit
cards. So, purchase volume trends will most certainly help bring the payment rate back in line with mean
averages. So, there's nothing that we see that's stressed, there's nothing that we see that there's indicative of a
change in direction relative to the slope of the performance. Thank you.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks. The loan growth guide is a bit above your kind of long-term expectation. Can you just talk a little bit about
is that more payment rate, is it more kind of acceleration in terms of the customer activity or is it still bit of a catch-
up from some of the pandemic-related maybe on the healthcare side?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Look, I would say, maybe just to take a step back, I'd say generally, we feel pretty good about the operating
environment as we look at it here for the balance of the year. We were talking about high single digits. Earlier this
year, I think we feel better that that's going to be in that kind of 10%-plus range. We're not relying on an enormous
amount of payment rate moderation in that; it really is more top line purchase volume-driven. We just had our
highest first quarter ever in terms of sales on our products, so we're seeing really good growth across the
portfolio. We had growth rates on receivables in the five platforms, anywhere from 6% to 12%. So, it's broad-
based. It's not one platform that's really driving that, it really is across the business.
So, we feel like at least for the balance of the year, the consumer is strong. As Brian said, two-thirds of them
saved at least a portion of, if not all of the stimulus. So, we're seeing that come through in purchase volume, we're
seeing it in the credit metrics. So, like I said, we feel pretty good about the environment right now and it really is
driving what we're seeing on the growth side and it's not necessarily a reversion to the mean on payment rate.

Autonomous Research, we have Brian Foran. Please go ahead.

Brian Foran Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Hi. Thanks. I guess, as you think about the outlook for the consumer and how you feed that through managing the
business, it's tricky, right, because you've been very clear everything you're seeing recently is better than
budgeted, consumers in great shape. One of the narratives in the market is the Fed has got to jack rates to 3%-
plus, it's got to get unemployment up to tame inflation, and it's kind of like all going to play out over the next six
months or so but we really won't know the impact until next year. And so, I guess the spirit of the question is like
as you think through your underwriting and your marketing this year, I know you're always making changes and
always trying to be thoughtful and proactive. Is there any scenario where like you're tightening underwriting even
though your book is doing great because of that forward Fed risk or how do you think about meeting that unusual
interest rate risk through the book and through your marketing plans as we move through the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian D. Doubles A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Synchrony Financial
Yeah. Look, generally, I would say, Brian, we're going through a period of extraordinarily strong performance as it
pertains to credit. I mean, we've never seen delinquencies and loss rates where they are. We don't underwrite to
these levels. They're about half of what we would consider a target NCO rate. And so, what I would tell you, we're
not tightening in expectation of what's going to happen in 2023 and 2024 because we didn't think take opportunity
to go a lot deeper, right? We're not underwriting to today's environment, whether it's how we're underwriting the
consumer, how we're underwriting new programs. We're looking at this as kind of an over time mean loss rate,
and that's what we're underwriting to.
So, one of the things that we've talked about in the past, it's really important in our businesses, when times are
extraordinarily good, we don't necessarily go a lot deeper. We try and maintain our discipline and we look at the
value of whether it's a customer or a program agreement. We look at that over a number of years and assume
that over that time period, you're going to have some reversion to the mean. And that's really the discipline that
we have around our underwriting model. Again, whether you're looking at consumers or new programs and how
we're pricing those, we try and factor in what we think is going to happen over the next few years and not take
advantage of the extraordinarily good period that we're operating in right now.
