Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
Ignacio Alvarez
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Good morning and thank you for joining the call. In 2023, we delivered solid results in a challenging environment.
Our annual net income of $541 million compared to net income of $1.1 billion in 2022. Our 2023 adjusted net
income was $587 million compared to adjusted net income of $808 million in 2002 (sic) [2022] (00:01:45). The
variance was mainly driven by a higher provision for loan losses and higher operating expenses. We grew our
loan portfolio by $3 billion or 9.3% during the year. BPPR generated loan growth across most business segments
led by commercial loans, reflecting the continued strength of the local economy and our diversified product
offering. Popular Bank achieved growth in commercial and construction loans.
During the fourth quarter, we increased our quarterly common stock dividend by $0.07 to $0.62 per share. Credit
quality remained solid throughout 2023 as evidenced by lower non-performing loans even though our unsecured
consumer portfolio did begin to normalize during the second-half of the year from historically low levels. Our
capital levels are strong with year-end Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 16.3%. Our tangible book value ended 2023
at $59.74, a 33% increase year-over-year, primarily due to lower unrealized losses on investment securities and
the year's earnings.
Over the past year, we have been executing on a broad-based multi-year technological and business process
transformation. While many of these investments are foundational in nature and will take time to show meaningful
results, we have already begun to see tangible revenue uplift from several of our early-stage initiatives. In Puerto
Rico, these include enhanced pricing segmentation in our commercial cash management business and
streamlined processing of small business loans. Our technology and business transformation continues to be a
priority. We believe that there are opportunities to grow in our primary market as well as within our existing
customer base. And these efforts will help us capitalize upon that opportunity. We are confident that these
investments will make us a stronger, more efficient and profitable company. We continue to target a 14% return
on tangible common equity by the fourth quarter of 2025.
Please turn to slide 4. Adjusted net income in the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of the FDIC Special
Assessment totaled $140 million, flat from the last quarter. Our loan balances grew by $1 billion with $729 million
at BPPR and $287 million at Popular Bank. Our net interest margin was 3.08% increasing by 1 basis point,
primarily driven by higher loan balances and the repricing of loans and securities in a higher interest rate
environment. This was offset by higher deposit costs.
Non-interest income remained solid, increasing by $9 million. Excluding the FDIC assessment, operating
expenses decreased by $6 million. Credit quality trends remained generally positive with lower NPLs once again.
However, we did continue to see credit normalization in the Puerto Rico unsecured consumer segment, which
began in the second-half of the year. We have taken actions to address these developments and are attentive to
the evolving credit landscape.
Deposit balances increased by approximately $300 million, primarily due to a higher level of online deposits at
Popular Bank. The $9.54 increase in tangible book value per share in the quarter was primarily driven by a
decrease in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio.
Please turn to slide 5. During 2023, we added 34,000 new customers in Puerto Rico and now serve more than 2
million unique customers. Utilization of digital channels among our retail customers also remained strong. Active
users on our Mi Banco platform exceeded 1.1 million or 54% of our customer base. In addition, we continue to
capture more than 60% of our deposits through digital channels.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
Consumer spending remained healthy. Combined credit and debit card sales fell by 1% compared to the fourth
quarter of 2022, which was a historically strong quarter. Our auto loan and lease balances increased by $61
million compared to the third quarter, as demand for new cars continued to be strong in Puerto Rico. Mortgage
loan balances at BPPR increased by $103 million in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by home purchase activity
and our strategy to retain FHA loan.
The Puerto Rico economy performed well during the quarter. Business activity is solid as reflected in the positive
trends in total employment and other economic data. The tourism and hospitality sector continues to be a source
of strength for the local economy. Passenger traffic at the San Juan International Airport increased by 18% in
2023 compared to the previous year and both the hotel occupancy rate and the average daily rate reflected a 5%
to 6% increase over 2022. There are roughly $50 billion of committed federal funds that have yet to be disbursed.
The pace of disbursement of these funds has accelerated and we anticipate that these funds will support
economic activity for several years.
We are encouraged by the performance of the Puerto Rico economy. We remain optimistic about the future of our
primary market and are well-positioned to support our clients during this historic period. We are pleased with our
results for the quarter and the year, particularly our strong loan growth in both Puerto Rico and the US as well as
the continued strength of our deposit base, which positions us well for 2024.
Finally, I'd like to take this opportunity to recognize Carlos, who will retire in March after 27 years of service at
Popular. As our CFO since 2013 and in various senior leadership positions before that, he excelled due to his
strategic mindset, analytical skills and discipline. He has been an important contributor to our growth and financial
strength and we are thankful for his leadership throughout all these years. On a more personal note, I am
sincerely grateful for his support since I joined Popular and for his friendship, which began long before. Jorge
Garcia, our Comptroller since 2012, has worked alongside Carlos for many years, helping to build a strong
finance team. He is widely respected within the organization and we are confident he will do a great job as our
new CFO.
On that note, I will now turn the call over to Carlos for more details on our financial results.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Ignacio, for those kind words as well for your friendship and leadership. I would like to offer my
gratitude to my colleagues at Popular. They make all our achievements possible. I also want to thank our
analysts, bankers and investors whose keen insights, challenging questions, recommendations and advice I have
greatly appreciated and value. Finally, I want to thank my successor, Jorge, for his support over the last 13 years
during which we have collaborated. I leave all of you in good hands. It has been my pleasure and honor to have
contributed to this great company for 27 years.
Please turn to slide 6. We reported net income of $95 million in the fourth quarter. Excluding the effect of the
FDIC assessment, adjusted net income was $140 million [indiscernible] (00:09:06) higher than the prior quarter.
Net interest income was $534 million, flat with Q3. During the fourth quarter, the net interest margin remained
stable despite rising deposit cost. Based on our current and forecasted asset mix, coupled with the effective rate
environment, we should continue to see NIM expansion in Q1 and throughout the rest of 2024. In 2024, we
expect net interest income to increase by approximately 9% to 13% from 2023 levels, driven by loan growth of 3%
to 6% and the continued improvement in our earning asset mix in a higher rate environment.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
Non-interest income was $169 million, an increase of $9 million versus Q3. In 2024, we expect non-interest
income to be approximately $160 million to $165 million per quarter, an increase of $5 million from our prior
guidance. The provision for credit losses was $79 million, compared to $45 million in the third quarter. Operating
expenses were $531 million in Q4. Excluding the effect of the FDIC assessment, adjusted operating expenses
were $459 million, a decrease of $6 million from Q3 and below our prior guidance of $175 million. The variance in
the quarter was driven primarily by a $23 million non-cash goodwill impairment in Q3 and lower credit card
processing and transactional expense by $8 million, mainly due to volume incentives recognized during the
quarter from the card networks.
For the year 2023, operating expenses increased by 9% to $1.9 billion, driven primarily by the higher FDIC
deposit insurance expense, the goodwill impairment taken in Q3, personnel cost and expenses related to
customer activity. Excluding the FDIC assessment in Q4, 2023 expenses were $1.83 billion, 5% higher than in
2022 but below our original guidance of $1.87 billion. For 2024, we expect annual expenses in the range of $1.89
billion to $1.95 billion. Approximately half of the predicted increase in expenses is related to technology
investments, some that rolled over from 2023. The other half is mostly personnel expenses as we continue to
invest in our people as well as expand our capabilities in cyber, risk, data and technology. This guidance includes
transformation-related expenses.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was negative 1.6%. The additional FDIC expense changed the mix of exempt
versus taxable income, increasing the proportion of exempt income. In addition, Q4 included a tax benefit
resulting from the filing of the 2022 tax returns that contributed to the negative rate for the quarter. For the full-
year 2023, the effective tax rate was 20%. Excluding the impact of the FDIC assessment, it was 21.5%, close to
the lower end of our guidance of 22% to 25%. In 2024, we expect the effective tax rate to be in a range from 19%
to 23%.
Please turn to slide 7. Net interest margin increased by 1 basis point to 3.08% in Q4. On a taxable equivalent
basis, NIM was 3.26%, an increase of 2 basis points versus Q3. The increase was driven by improved earning
asset mix, higher loan yields and balances across most major lending categories as well as higher yields on our
cash balances and investments. This was offset by higher interest expense on deposits due to increased cost of
public deposits and growth in high-cost deposit accounts of Popular Bank. At the end of the fourth quarter, Puerto
Rico public deposits were $18.1 billion, an increase of roughly $300 million compared to Q3 and at the upper-end
of our guidance. In 2024, we expect public deposits to be in a range of $15 billion to $18 billion. As usual,
seasonality should result in public deposit balances trending higher at the beginning of the year and peaking in
Q2, mostly related to tax receipts.
Excluding Puerto Rico public deposits, consolidated customer deposit balances were flat compared to Q3. In
Puerto Rico, customer deposits decreased, driven by commercial outflows. For the year, approximately $1.3
billion in deposit balances were transferred by commercial and retail customers from BPPR to Popular Securities.
In Q4, deposit increases at Popular Bank were primarily driven by increases in time and saving deposits from our
online channel. Ending loan balances increased by $1 billion or 3% compared to Q3, driven by growth in most
loan segments of BPPR and by commercial and construction at PB. In 2023, loan balances increased by $3
billion or 9.3% versus $2.8 billion or 9.7% in 2022. We will continue to take advantage of current opportunities to
extend credit and improve the use and yield of our existing liquidity. In 2024, we expect loan growth of 3% to 6%,
driven primarily by the commercial loan segments in both banks. Our interest rate sensitivity is relatively neutral.
We saw a small margin expansion in Q4 and expect the margin to remain in an upward trajectory in 2024. The
magnitude will depend on our loan and deposit growth and mix, investment portfolio strategy as well as the pace
of repricing of public funds and incrementally retail and commercial deposits in our US operation.

Please turn to slide 8. Deposit betas in the current tightening cycle are above the prior cycle. We have seen a
total cumulative deposit beta of 36% to-date, driven by public deposits. The rate of increase in deposit costs for
the corporation continued to slow down in the quarter. In BPPR, total deposit cost increased by 11 basis points
compared to an increase of 24 basis points in Q3 led by public deposits. Excluding public deposit balances, total
deposit costs remained flat at 55 basis points. At Popular Bank, deposit cost increased by 33 basis points,
compared to an increase of 29 basis points in Q3, led by retail deposits coming primarily through our online
channel.
Puerto Rico government deposits are composed of numerous clients and accounts. The calculation methodology
and rate of those accounts may vary depending on the timing of shifts and the related balances within accounts.
On occasion, we may also provide temporary pricing concessions as part of our customary relationship
management activities. In Q4, the mix shift and the customer and the temporary preferential rates resulted in an
overall increase of 34 basis points in the cost of public deposits versus the 10 basis points we had anticipated at
the end of the third quarter. We expect the cost of public deposits to remain flat in Q1. Please note that on page
14 of our investor presentation, we have added a page summarizing the expense guidance for 2024, which we
are providing in this webcast.
Please turn to slide 9. Our return on tangible equity was 6.3% in the quarter. For the full-year, our ROTCE was
9.4%. Both ratios were impacted by the FDIC assessment. We continue to target a sustainable 14% ROTCE by
the end of 2025.
Regulatory capital levels remain strong. Our Q4 Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 16.3% decreased by 51 basis
point from Q3, reflecting continued strong growth in our loan portfolio, which carries a higher regulatory risk rating
– weighting, I'm sorry. Tangible book value per share at quarter-end was $59.74, an increase of $9.54 per share,
up almost 19% from Q3. Over the past two years, we have continued to effectively deploy our capital. This has
been highlighted by the loan growth of almost $6 billion, the increasing trajectory of our dividend and multiple
share repurchases, including the return to our shareholders of the gain on sale of our Evertec stake. We will
revisit future capital actions in the second-half of 2024. In the near-term, we continue to seek more clarity on the
outlook for rate, the economy and the proposed regulatory response to events in the banking sector.
Our long-term outlook on capital return has not changed, anchored by our strong regulatory capital ratios. Over
time, we expect our regulatory capital ratios to gravitate toward the levels of our mainland peers plus a buffer.
With that, I'd turn the call over to Lidio.

Lidio V. Soriano
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer-Corporate Risk Management Group, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Carlos, and good morning. Overall, the corporation's mortgage and commercial portfolios continue to
reflect credit metrics significantly below pre-pandemic levels, while credit quality metrics continue to normalize for
Puerto Rico's personal loan, credit cards and auto and lease finance loans. We are closely monitoring the
performance of our consumer portfolio and have made changes to our underwriting criteria to decrease exposure
to higher risk segments.
For the year, non-performing loans decreased from $439 million or 1.4% of total loans to $358 million or 1%.
While net charge-off increased from historic lows during the year, they still compare very favorably against pre-
pandemic averages. We continue to closely monitor changes in the macroeconomic environment and the
borrower performance given higher interest rate and inflationary pressures. We believe that the improvements

over recent years, the risk management practices and the risk profile of the corporation loan portfolios positions
Popular to continue to operate successfully under the current environment.
Turning to slide number 10. Non-performing assets and non-performing loans decreased slightly during the
quarter, driven by the mortgage portfolio in Puerto Rico. Commercial NPLs in Puerto Rico remained flat quarter-
over-quarter. Notwithstanding the inflow of an $18 million relationship in the renewable energy sector. This
relationship drove the increase in NPL inflows for the quarter. Despite these inflows, the ratio of NPLs to total
loans held in portfolio decreased to 1% from 1.1% in the previous quarter.
Turning to slide number 11. Net charge-offs amounted to $57 million or an annualized 66 basis points of average
loans held in portfolio compared to $33 million or 39 basis points in the prior quarter. The increase was mainly in
Puerto Rico and the biggest variances were seen in commercial and consumer net charge-off. Commercial net
charge-offs were $4 million or 17 basis points, a variance of $14 million due to an $11 million recovery in the
previous quarter. Additionally, consumer net charge-offs were $11 million higher due to the credit normalization in
auto, personal loan and credit cards. As we have discussed in the past, prior to the COVID pandemic, Popular net
charge-offs were generally between 75 and 125 basis point. For 2024, we expect net charge-offs for the full-year
to be between 65 to 85 basis points due to the ongoing credit normalization and general economic environment.
Please turn to slide number 12. The allowance for credit losses increased by $18 million to $729 million. This was
driven by a reserve build in the Puerto Rico commercial portfolio due to a $10 million specific reserve for the
previously mentioned new NPL loan growth and higher reserves for the consumer portfolios due to credit
normalization. In the US, the ACL increased by $3 million, driven by higher commercial loan reserve due to rating
migration. The corporation ratio of ACL to loans held in portfolio remained flat at 2.1%, while the ratio of ACL to
NPL stood at 204% compared to 197% in the previous quarter. The provision for credit losses was $75 million, a
$32 million increase from the prior quarter, was driven by the $10 million specific reserve mentioned earlier and
credit normalization of the Puerto Rico retail portfolios. Also, contributing to the increase were third quarter event
such as recoveries in the Puerto Rico commercial portfolio and the recalibration last quarter of the US CRE
allowance model, which led to a $50 million reduction in reserves.
To summarize, our Puerto Rico consumer loan portfolio continued to normalize during the quarter, while the
corporation mortgage and commercial portfolios continue to reflect strong credit quality trends with low net
charge-offs and decreasing non-performing loans. We are attentive to the evolving environment but remain
encouraged by the performance of our loan book.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ignacio for his concluding remarks. Thank you.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Lidio and Carlos for your updates. 2023 was a good year for Popular, despite a challenging
environment which included high interest rate, uncertainty in the geopolitical situation and disruptions in the
banking industry during the first-half of the year. Our results reflect solid earnings, robust loan growth, stable
credit quality and continued customer growth. We achieved important milestones, including surpassing 2 million
unique customers in Puerto Rico. We also made great progress in our transformation efforts and some of the
initiatives are already producing encouraging results. I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation to our
employees for all their hard work and dedication during the year.
In October, we celebrated our 130th anniversary We are proud of the legacy that made Popular what it is today: A
strong, vibrant organization with deep-rooted values. Leveraging this strength, we will continue to transform our

organization to ensure its success for many years to come. This entails meeting the rapidly changing needs of our
customers, providing our colleagues a workplace where they can thrive, promoting progress in the communities
we serve, and generating sustainable value for our shareholders.
I am optimistic about our prospects in 2024. Economic trends in Puerto Rico continue to be positive and we are
well-positioned to participate in the economic activity that is expected to be generated in the coming year. We are
looking forward to a great year. We started with strong momentum and the team is energized. We are now ready

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Looking at the NII guidance, it's pretty impressive for 2024, especially considering the expectation for loan growth
to moderate in the coming year. Two-part question: First, what are your rate assumptions embedded in that NII
guidance? And, second, can you maybe talk through NII cadence throughout the year, especially now that public
funds deposit costs have stabilized?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
All right. [indiscernible] (00:27:06)
Yeah. Timur, the underlying rate our assumptions that are embedded in our forecast, we are in the lower-end of
the market as far as number of decreases in rates and we have them all in the second-half of the year. That

changes every day, of course today after GDP is lower than it was yesterday. But – so we're at the low-end of the
consensus range and the second-half of the year.
With regards to NII, I mean, the effect of the cost of government funds, if, in fact, rates are flat, are coming down,
should be pretty neutral moving forward. In fact, I've mentioned in my prepared comments that we expect the cost
of deposits to remain flat for the first quarter, so that will hopefully be one of the contributors. The rest of the
consumers are going to be dependent on their loan growth, on what sector our loan growth happens, the speed at
which it happens, and then the repricing of our investment portfolio as well as it continues to mature.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q

Okay. And Carlos, can you provide just how many rate cuts you are assuming in the back-end of the year?

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Maybe one for Lidio. So last quarter, you called out the low FICO used car borrower. This quarter you
called out credit cards, personal loans and some segments of auto as being higher risk. Maybe just talk through
the normalization of the consumer? What would you classify as being higher risk balances and then how should
we think about this segment relative to the current 11% allowance allocation?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer-Corporate Risk Management Group, Popular, Inc.
I think as generally when you're looking at consumer and retail portfolios, the high-risk segments are always going
to be driven by FICO. So if you have lower FICO, [indiscernible] (00:29:36) to be higher risk. We have seen, I
think I – last quarter I also mentioned the monetization of personal loans and credit cards. And what we have
seen this quarter is it continues along the spectrum. I think maybe a gradual increase also in delinquencies and
charge-offs in auto lease, which was maybe I did not mention in the last quarter.
But what's the last part of your question? I'm sorry, Timur.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Within 11% allowance ratio, do you think this normalization causes increased allowance from here or is that
normalization primarily in the charge-offs with the allowance ratio staying relatively stable?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer-Corporate Risk Management Group, Popular, Inc.
I mean, I think the normal -we – I expect normalization to continue maybe through the first-half of the year. And
the movement that you have seen, our allowance should be replicated in the first-half, which has been pretty
consistent around the 2%, 2.1%, excluding any changes in economic forecast or anything like that.

Lidio V. Soriano A

That is not a disclosure that we provide. So, no.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
What we do provide, as you know, in the appendix, Timur, is the different consumer portfolios and the originations
over time in a very extended of time. So from that, you will not get the actual balances that you're requesting but
you'll get a sense of where the portfolio is. Because I think we have eight or nine years' worth of origination and
most of these products have a life of two or three years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer-Corporate Risk Management Group, Popular, Inc.
I think maybe most important, Timur, looking at more from a macro context, looking at the strength of the Puerto
Rico economy, the liquidity of our clients. We don't foresee an acceleration of losses. I mean, we're seeing a trend
of normalization and thus our forecast – embedded in the forecast and the guidance that we provided for losses
next year.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
All right. Yeah. Thank you. I was curious if we could just take a moment. I know you said the loan growth is being
partially funded by just a mix in the loans from securities. How should we think about the overall balance sheet
size? It should be obviously lower growth than loans but should we – and the static balance sheet size is
somewhat acceptable or something we should expect or should we see a little bit of growth in the balance sheet
as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
You've seen our balance sheet be pretty static actually this year despite the big loan growth because what ends
up happening is that we have a big shift from securities and cash into the loan portfolio. So, I mean, I don't –
balance sheet growth is not necessarily a target that we're pursuing. If it happens, it happens. But we still have
significant amount of liquidity. We still have significant amount of the investment portfolio maturing every quarter
that is more than capable of funding loan growth. So I would probably expect more shift from the investment
portfolio and cash to loans. And the overall size may not change a hell of a lot.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got you. Thanks. That makes sense. And then it seems like you are reinvesting some just given the amount of
liquidity it [ph] spits (00:33:48) off. I was just curious where in the curve in terms of duration are you kind of
approaching any sort of reinvestment?

Yeah. So it's basically [indiscernible] (00:34:14) in cash or cash like instruments, Timur (sic) [Ben] (00:34:17). But
we are having the discussions of potential extension in the investment portfolio, we have not executed any of that.
The extension we have achieved and its significant obviously is the move from cash to our loan book, which has a
much higher duration than cash.

Got you. If I can just sneak one more into. I know you gave the expense guidance. Is that – if it's the high-end of
the range on revenue, should we expect high-end of the range on expenses as well? Does that include some sort
of a commission or bonus payment as well? Or is the potentially even higher revenue does come in on the high-
end?

Carlos J. Vázquez A

No. The range does not necessarily include our profit-sharing, which I think is what you're referring to. We do – as
you know, we have to exceed our budget by a given margin for that to kick in. So it's not necessarily there. I wish
there was a perfect connection, as you suggest, between the high-end of one the – on the revenue and the high-
end on the expenses but that's not necessarily the case.

Good morning, Alex.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Just wanted to dig back into the NIM a little bit or the NII guide. In the past, you guys have kind of quantified each
rate cut or each rate hike has a very specific impact on NII each quarter. Are you able to do that or...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Well, I mean, I think the best way to think about that Alex is to go back to my comment that we are largely rate-
neutral in our balance sheet composition right now. So a change in rates will not have a very material effect in that
range we provided. Okay. Because our balance sheet is to, a large extent, neutral to movement in rates in the
short-term.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then on slide 20, the maturity schedule on the US Treasury notes. Is it pretty fair to assume that the
sort of $1 billion or so that comes off each quarter is right around that 1.5% yield?

Yes. That's the right number.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. And then – it just – when I look at the net charge-off guidance that you guys provided versus what
we've seen over the last couple of years and really all the macro data and unemployment rate and sort of the
momentum behind the economy, it feels like the net charge-off guide is being a little bit conservative. Are you –
when you come up with that guidance range, is it – are you looking at specific inputs or is it really just kind of a
hunch that things kind of have to get worse from a pretty good – pretty solid level where they've been?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer-Corporate Risk Management Group, Popular, Inc.
I think it's a combination of things. We look obviously at trends, recent trends, and we also look at the expected
economic forecast over the next year, which we provide to you in our allowance slide. So I think it's a combination
of factors, those two being two of the most important factors.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. So, I mean, I think in the past, Carlos, you have I think – a comment that has stuck with me is that people
when they're employed tend to pay their bills and...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer-Corporate Risk Management Group, Popular, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
...and with unemployment being as strong as it has been and employment growing and all the momentum by the
economy and potential tax – additional tax breaks coming early this year for sort of the low-income sector. I mean,
it feels like you should be able to do much better than that or at least better than that 65 to 85 basis point range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
I think Alex that you have described the environment well. As I think we've discussed in the past, we are a little bit
puzzled in trying to make the connection as well. We are doing our best to understand the drivers on why this is
happening when the underlying economy and employment situation is strong. But what we are seeking to
understand the connection better. We also cannot ignore the fact that we are seeing the increased delinquencies.
And so we have to make sure that we reflect that in our outlook.
The other thing of course the environment in the Mainland is equally positive and most banks in Mainland are
seeing similar deterioration in the consumer portfolio. So I guess we're not the only ones with the conundrum in
trying to connect how the economy is going and employment is going versus how some clients are behaving. But
– so we're working on that.

Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi. Thanks for the question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Good morning, Kelly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I guess carrying on with that and I got a little turned around earlier in the call when you were talking about net
charge-offs and the reserve. I don't know if I picked up on that clearly. I just wanted to circle back. It looks like in
your ACL movement in slide 12, you added about $63 million related to consumer portfolio changes. Just wanted
to confirm if that's related to that deterioration that you see in the consumer portfolio and if that implies that some
of the increase that you're expecting may already be in your allowance?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer-Corporate Risk Management Group, Popular, Inc.
That portfolio change is a combination of things. It is portfolio growth. Changing in credit quality. It's replenishing
the net charge-offs for the period. So it is all of that combined leads to that $63 million figure that you see in the
slide.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. That's really helpful. And then I guess touching – turning around to the tax rate. It's come down a bit. Can
you talk again? I know there's some unique factors in Puerto Rico. Can you talk about what's taken your effective
tax rate lower and what could cause us to come in the high-end versus low-end of that range?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. I mean the drivers of the fourth quarter were the two I mentioned, Kelly, is we – because of the effect of the
additional expense of the FDIC assessment, we ended up changing the mix of taxable versus exempt income and
we ended ended the quarter with much higher proportion of exempt income versus non-exempt income. That
obviously affects our tax rate.
The other contributing factor is that we finished our 2022 tax returns and that resulted in a benefit that also
lowered the taxes in the fourth quarter. So those are the two effects. I certainly hope not to see another FDIC
assessment and definitely not of the size of this one moving forward. So that part of the condition should not
14


Popular, Inc.
(BPOP) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
repeat itself. And we already filed the 2022 taxes. So I don't think we can refile them again anytime soon,
although there's always reviews and adjustments on those things. So I think and I'll look at my colleague here,
Jorge who's [ph] a former (000:42:50) tax expert, I think the conditions that led to that variation are pretty
idiosyncratic and pretty unique to the last quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jorge J. García A
Senior Vice President & Corporate Comptroller, Popular, Inc.
I would say – this is Jorge. As we go forward, I mean certainly the composition of taxable versus tax-exempt
income and that mix is always going to impact that range that we're giving you. So if it's actually something that
can grow faster or the contribution of it because of the disallowed expenses, et cetera, becomes a higher
proportion, our overall effective tax rate will come down. But that condition will exist beyond any type of period
adjustments that are more unique.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
That's why we give you a range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Thank you. And I appreciate all the guidance. Maybe talking about fees. Can you – it looks like it implies an
increase, at least with the high-end relative to last year. Can you discuss some of the initiatives you've taken on,
one. And then, two, have you done a review at all of how any of the proposed interchange and overdrafts might
impact your fee income?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Yes. Let me take the second part of your question first, because it's the simplest to answer. I think in the last
webcast, we were asked of the potential effect of the elimination of late fees on credit cards and we mentioned
that our estimate of the potential effect of that was something around $9 million. The additional things that are
being discussed now that were not on the table last quarter is a potential reduction in overdraft NFS (sic) [NSF]
(00:44:40) fees. We don't have NFS (sic) [NSF] (00:44:44) fees for retail clients in either of our two banks. We do
have some overdraft fees but the effect of that is somewhat muted because overdraft fees in Puerto Rico are
already capped at $15 per occurrence and the proposal is – in the high-end, the proposal of $14. So in that front
and of course the proposal can change, our best guess is that the effect could be something between $500,000
and $2 million worth of loss fees.
And then the last piece of the puzzle that is in discussion now is the potential changes in interchange fees for
debit. And our best guess right now is that could have an effect of up to $50 million or something in that ballpark.
So those three pieces are again all these are estimates, will depend on how the final rule comes out and the
levels that we end up setting and when it happens and everything else. But those are the best estimates we have
of a potential effect as far as lower fees.
Now, when we talk about the fees for 2023, I want to make sure that we don't lose context. We lost a significant
amount of fees in 2022 as the year evolved because of changes in NFS (sic) [NSF] (00:46:08) and overdraft fees.
So our guidance went down and not in material amount because of our recognition that we had lost our fees in
2022. Now, we ended up doing a pretty good job. And if you just look at the way of how our fees have changed
15


Popular, Inc.
(BPOP) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
over time, you probably won't be able to tell that in 2022 we lost a significant amount of fees because we were
pretty good at substituting them with other income in the fee category.
The main contributors to that substitution are the two things that Ignacio mentioned: Number one, we have
repriced our offering of cash management services in the corporate sector and that brought in additional fees.
And number two.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. That's the main driver.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Well – yeah. The main driver was that, the repricing of cash management services. So we ended up conceptually
making up for the lost fees in 2022 and the year ended up pretty flat. We expect some of the transformation
efforts we're doing to continue to add, contribute to the fee income of the company. That, in part, is why we are
increasing the guidance somewhat. And it's not a big increase but it's an increase that [ph] is not unimportant at
all (00:47:44)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. We also saw an increase in the interchange fees from our small commercial credit card. I think that's the
other – that's the second factor. I don't think I mentioned it but that's the second factor.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Carlos J. Vázquez A

I just wanted to ask within the NII guidance, I think I heard you that you got two cuts in the back-half of the year
but wanted to ask what you all are assuming for a retail and commercial deposit beta within that NII growth
guidance?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
We have not discussed forward-looking beta, Brody, but I think it's not unreasonable to assume that the rate of
increase in beta should subside with stable rates and more so if rates start to drop. But we have not given details
on the forward-looking beta.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. I wanted to circle back to the consumer credit discussion. I just want to make sure the consumer
credit allowance is about 5.25%, right? So that looks relatively unchanged quarter-over-quarter. Actually it came
down just a little bit just given the growth of the loan portfolio. I guess the first question there is what's the life of
loan assumption for the consumer book under CECL?

Lidio V. Soriano A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer-Corporate Risk Management Group, Popular, Inc.
I mean obviously all of consumer books is pretty short-dated in terms of duration. So we'll call it, let's call it, a year
-two years thereabout.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And is this – the 3% level that you had for annualized charge-offs in the consumer book, when I just kind of
quickly look back at my model, it looked like outside of a couple of quarters during COVID, this is the highest
period for consumer credit losses that you all have had, either from a dollar amount or from a NCO rate
perspective. And so is this the kind of new level that we should expect to see here? And if it is, if it's two years and
we're talking about 3% of charge-offs, is there a case to be made that we need to walk the consumer reserve
incrementally higher from here than where it actually is?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
You're asking a lot of question but I will say this. I mean, we'll go back to what I mentioned in our prepared
remarks, our outlook for in terms of losses is we expect losses next year to be between 65 to 85 basis point. A lot
of the drivers in the losses are associated with our retail book. We expect normalization to continue in those
portfolios so we'll see. And we are close in terms of the losses that we experienced prior to the pandemic vis a vis
the losses that we're experiencing today. As I also mentioned, we remain positive for the outlook of our consumer
books given the strength of the economy and the liquidity of our clients.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. So is there anything specific going on that's causing the charge-off rate to move to a level that's kind of at
the high-end I guess of what you would consider normal, just given the strength of the economy and given the fact
that employment is so strong on the island?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer-Corporate Risk Management Group, Popular, Inc.
I think that's part of the conundrum that Carlos referred to. We have seen – I mean you have also seen banks in
the US experience the same in terms of – even in the face of a very strong economy, you're seeing consumer
portfolios deteriorate. I mean, if you wanted me to speculate, I could say I mean there is potentially – a couple of
things I will say: They played out of inflation on higher rates as having an impact in the cash flows of some of our
customers that we might be leading to strategic defaults. And I mean, there is, if you look at some of the analysis
and studies done by some of the credit bureaus, there is something that relate – they call FICO inflation in which
after the pandemic, the FICOs of a lot of the consumers went up and that also created an environment in which
now FICOs are behaving a little bit worse than they behaved prior to the pandemic.

Carlos J. Vázquez A

Brody, you've heard Lidio before say that historically our losses has gravitated in a range between 75 and 125
basis points. So the range of losses we're talking about 65 to 85 basis points is sort of in the low-end of that
historic range. So I wouldn't characterize that range as a very high-level of losses. It's the low-end of our historic
ranges.

Hi. Thanks for the follow-up. Just looking at capital repatriation, can you provide us an update or a reminder as to

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer-Corporate Finance Group, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. I mentioned that the second half of the year, historically we have done our stress test in the third quarter
and that has normally been an important part of our discussions. But I think we also we have also mentioned a
number of times that we are rethinking how we manage our capital return activities. We've also mentioned that in
all probability, we will gravitate to a format that's more similar to what other banks do, meaning that we will –
20

probably not be announcing a buyback and immediately doing an ASR but rather be announcing an authorization
for a buyback to execute it over a period of time. That's the kind of changes we're talking about.
In conjunction with those changes, we may also change other parts of how we do capital planning. So – well,
historically, the – our stress tests in the third quarter have been an important contributor, there's – even that is
something that we may change depending on things evolve. So it's on the same [ph] timing (00:58:48) process,
Timur. Our best guess right now is that that we will, number one, get the clarity we're looking for in the three
factors we mentioned: rates, economy and regulator by the summer. And then that would allow us to reengage
from that front.
