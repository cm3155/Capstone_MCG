......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Thank you, Jennifer. Let me join in welcoming you to our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. Similar to the last few
years, 2023 presented a challenging operating environment. We experienced a combination of geopolitical
instability, highly visible bank failures, and elevated inflation and interest rate. I would like to thank our teams
across the company for their tireless efforts to serve our clients under these difficult circumstances.
Turning to our numbers, our fourth quarter results capped off a solid year of progress towards driving improved
long-term financial performance. On a year-over-year basis, reported fourth quarter revenue was $1.6 billion,
expenses were $1.4 billion, and earnings per share were $0.52. Our performance in the quarter included the
impact of $261 million in notable items. Adjusting for the notable items in both periods, fourth quarter revenue on
a year-over-year basis was flat, with trust fees up 5% and expenses up 3%.
We focused much of our efforts in 2023 on expense control, making various structural and governance changes
to enable sustained long-term productivity improvements. Actions included disciplined head count management,
vendor consolidation, rationalization of our real estate footprint, and process automation. Although we brought our
year-over-year expense growth down in each quarter this year, our expense growth in 2023 was still too high
relative to our trust fee and revenue growth levels in recent years. As such, lowering the trajectory of our expense
growth further remains a top priority this year as well.

Turning to the businesses, our organic growth continued to be below historical levels, although we saw
improvement throughout the year. Within Wealth Management, for the fourth quarter in the year, solid growth in
client advisory fees was largely offset by product level asset outflows. We continued to see ongoing strength in
the higher wealth tiers above $50 million in client assets, where our expertise, track record and industry
leadership are significant differentiators. Our ability to harness the data and analytics from serving the wealthiest
people in the world for more than 130 years, coupled with our holistic advice-driven culture, sets us apart in the
marketplace and will continue to be an important driver of our success.
Drawing from our experience working with some of the most sophisticated families around the globe, next month,
the Northern Trust Institute will publish its first book, Secrets of Enterprising Families. The book will provide a
window into what works for ultra-high-net-worth families who have succeeded generation after generation and
what doesn't, to help other families gain important insights and unlock value. The book will be launched with a
series of client and prospect events around the country, giving us a new channel to establish relationships and
develop business. Finally, as a testament to our exceptional client service and expertise, in 2023, we were named
Best Private Bank for Family Offices in the US and Best Private Bank for Succession Planning in the US by the
Financial Times Group.
Asset Servicing generated solid new business growth in both the fourth quarter and full year, but this was largely
offset by continuing asset outflows at the client level and generally lower transaction volumes and capital markets
activities. We performed particularly well with asset owners in the Americas in the fourth quarter. Notable wins
included the State of Nebraska Investment Council Pension Plan and Costco's retirement plan. We were also re-
appointed as asset servicing provider for the Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan.
Throughout the year, we also generated healthy momentum with asset managers in the UK and EMEA regions,
where our solutions for alternatives and private credit were particularly well-received. We've recently finalized
terms with one of the world's largest private markets firms, which will add significant scale to our alternatives
division. This appointment is a testament to our ability to successfully compete for some of the largest and most
complex mandates. Our Asset Servicing business received numerous awards in 2023 for its innovation and
industry leadership, including Best Outsourcing Provider by Waters, European Transfer Agent of the Year and
Administrator of the Year by Funds Europe, Best Global Custodian for Asset Owners by AsianInvestor.
In asset management, following several quarters of client outflows, we generated positive overall inflows in the
fourth quarter, including healthy growth in index equity and our fourth consecutive quarter of positive liquidity
inflows. We've seen particularly good momentum in our high-yield complex, with 93% of our taxable active funds
outperforming their one-year benchmarks. Our alternatives funds have also continued to generate solid growth
and remain an important driver of our fee revenue. As a result, our product launches during the year focused
largely on alternatives capabilities.
In closing, we enter 2024 with positive momentum, well-positioned to navigate the ongoing macroeconomic and
market uncertainty. Our focus is squarely on accelerating profitable organic growth, maintaining our expense
discipline, and driving greater resiliency and efficiency in our operating model.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jason to review our financial performance. Jason?

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
Thank you, Mike. Let me join Jennifer and Mike in welcoming you to our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. Let's
dive into the financial results of the quarter, starting on page 4. This morning, we reported GAAP fourth quarter
net income of $113 million, earnings per share of $0.52, and our return on average common equity was 4%. As
noted on the slide, our reported results included a $176 million loss on the sale of securities related to a
repositioning of the portfolio that we completed in November. They also included an $85 million FDIC special
assessment.
Our assets under custody and administration and assets under management were up sharply on both a
sequential and year-over-year basis. Strong equity and fixed income markets, coupled with favorable currency
movements drove most of the improvement in both periods, offset slightly by asset outflows in both periods. Given
the intra-period market movement and lag effects of our fee arrangements, markets had an unfavorable impact on
sequential trust fee growth and a favorable impact on year-over-year trust fee growth.
On a year-over-year basis, currency movements had an approximate 90 basis point favorable impact on revenue
growth, largely within our Asset Servicing segment, and a 110 basis point unfavorable impact on expenses. On a
sequential basis, currency impacts were immaterial. Excluding notable items in all periods, revenue was flat on
both a sequential quarter and year-over-year basis. Expenses were well-controlled, up 1.9% sequentially and up
2.6% over the prior year. Trust, investment and other servicing fees totaled $1.1 billion, 2% sequential decrease
and a 5% increase compared to last year.
All other noninterest income on an FTE basis was down 6% sequentially and down 5% over the prior year. Net
interest income on an FTE basis was $501 million, up 7% sequentially and down 9% from a year ago. Our
provision for credit losses was $11 million in the fourth quarter. Overall, our credit quality remains very strong. Net
charge-offs during the quarter were $2 million. Nonperforming loan levels decreased to $64 million from $69
million in the prior period, and nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans remained stable.
Turning to our Asset Servicing results on page 5. Assets under custody/administration for Asset Servicing clients
were $14 trillion at quarter-end. Asset Servicing fees totaled $612 million. Custody and fund administration fees
were $420 million. Assets under management for Asset Servicing clients were $1 trillion, and asset management
fees within Asset Servicing were $131 million. Moving to our Wealth Management business on page 6. Assets
under management for our Wealth Management clients were [ph] $423 billion. Assets and (00:10:40) trust,
investment and other servicing fees for Wealth Management clients were $478 million.
Moving to page 7 and our balance sheet and net interest income trends. Our average balance sheet decreased
3% on a linked-quarter basis, primarily due to lower borrowing activity. It declined 8% compared to the prior year
due to lower client deposits. Average deposits were $102 billion, essentially flat with the prior quarter and
meaningfully better than our expectations. We experienced a stronger-than-anticipated increase in deposits late in
the quarter, ending the year at $116 billion.
At quarter-end, operational deposits comprised approximately two-thirds of institutional deposits, and institutional
deposits comprised 75% to 80% of the total mix. Despite significant leverage capacity, we reduced our average
borrowings by $4 billion relative to the third quarter or nearly 4%, reducing both our FHLB advances and Fed
funds purchased.
Shifting to the asset side of the balance sheet, $3.2 billion securities repositioning we completed in November
involved the sale of both high-quality liquid assets and non-high-quality liquid assets available-for-sale securities
with a weighted average maturity of two to three years. Earlier this week, we completed another $2.1 billion
repositioning, which enhances our flexibility, given the dynamic rate environment. We'll record an associated loss

in the first quarter of approximately $200 million. The proceeds of both sales were invested in short floating rate
securities, further reducing the duration of the portfolio, which is now 1.8 years.
Average loan balances were $42 billion, flat both sequentially and relative to the prior year. Our end-of-period
loan balances were up $4 billion or 9% over the third quarter, reflecting an increase in overdrafts related to higher
levels of year-end trading and settlement activity. Our loans have since returned to $42 billion. The heightened
activity at the end of the quarter did not have a material impact on net interest income in either the fourth quarter
or first quarter. As a reminder, approximately 75% of the loan portfolio is floating.
The total balance sheet duration continues to be less than a year. Our average liquidity levels remain strong.
Cash held at the Federal Reserve and other central banks was down, reflecting the decrease in borrowings. But
high-quality liquid assets comprise more than 50% of our deposits and more than 40% of total earning assets on
average. Our net interest income in 2024 will continue to be driven largely by client deposit behavior, which has
been less predictable given the unique aspects of this rate cycle.
We expect the November and January securities repositioning to provide an incremental $30 million in net interest
income per quarter in 2024 relative to fourth quarter levels. We currently expect first quarter net interest income to
be in the range of $480 million to $500 million. This assumes deposits remain stable, but deposit pricing continues
to be under some pressure, with further NIM compression possible as long as quantitative tightening persists and
the deposit environment stays highly competitive.
Turning to page 8, as reported, noninterest expenses were $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up 9% sequentially
and up 5% as compared to the prior year. Excluding notable items in both periods as listed on the slide, expenses
in the fourth quarter were up just under 2% sequentially and under 3% year-over-year. I'll hit on just a few
highlights. Excluding all notable items, compensation expense was up 2% year-over-year. This reflected the
impact from 2023 base pay adjustments, partially offset by reductions in incentive compensation and head count
actions taken year-to-date.
Full-time equivalent head count was down 200 or 1% sequentially and down 500 or 2% over the prior year.
Excluding notable items in all periods, non-compensation expense was up 3% year-over-year. Equipment and
software expense was up 10% year-over-year, largely due to increased amortization expense. Recall that as
much as two-thirds of this line item is comprised of depreciation and amortization expense. And finally, we
realized 200 basis points of trust fee operating leverage in the quarter.
Turning to the full year results on page 9. Trust fees were down 2% in 2023, largely due to asset outflows and
weaker transaction volume, partially offset by the elimination of rate-driven fee waivers and new business
generation. Excluding the impact of the two securities repositionings, other noninterest income was down 9%,
reflecting weakness in foreign exchange trading and other capital markets activities. Net interest income was up
over $100 million or 6%, which largely offset the decline in the other noninterest income categories. This
translated to flat total revenue growth.
Reported expenses were up 6% for the full year to $5.3 billion. Excluding notable items in both periods as listed
on the slide, the expenses were $5.1 billion in 2023, up 4.8%, which compares favorably to 2022. As we've
noticed previously, we expect to bring the expense growth rate down further in 2024. We have clear line of sight
to two key areas of increase, base pay adjustments within compensation expense, and depreciation and
amortization increases within equipment and software.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
On a blended rate, we expect to provide base pay adjustments of approximately $65 million in 2024, which will hit
our compensation line beginning in the second quarter. This compares to base pay adjustments of $80 million in
2023. Within equipment and software expense, we expect a $65 million or 10% increase in 2024. Combined,
these two line items will drive approximately 3% increase in operating expenses above 2023 levels alone. That
said, we expect to continue to generate meaningful efficiency gains from our Productivity Office and have
identified further opportunities for improvement.
As we look out to the first quarter, we expect the following. First quarter compensation expense will include our
annual equity incentive payments, including those for retirement-eligible employees, along with modest employee
head count growth associated with growth in the underlying businesses. This should translate to a sequential
increase of $50 million to $55 million. Employee benefits expense is expected to increase by approximately $10
million due to seasonally higher payroll taxes.
Turning to page 10, our capital levels and regulatory ratios remained strong in the quarter. We continue to operate
at levels well above our required regulatory minimums. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio under the standardized
approach was flat with the prior quarter at 11.4%, as capital accretion offset a modest increase in risk-weighted
assets levels. This reflects a 440 basis point buffer above our regulatory requirements.
Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.1%, up 20 basis points from the prior quarter. At quarter-end, our unrealized pre-
tax loss on available-for-sale securities was $924 million. We returned over $300 million to common shareholders
in the quarter through cash dividends of $156 million and common stock repurchases of $146 million. For the full
year, we returned approximately $980 million to common stockholders, including common stock repurchases of
approximately $350 million.
And with that, Ruth, please open the line for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Glenn Schorr with Evercore.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Good morning, Glenn.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hello there. Good morning. So, I appreciate all the numbers you helped us with. I'm going to try to peek a little bit
more under the covers. So, deposits stable. Heard your thoughts on 1Q NII on the further deposit pricing
pressure. So, the question is, as we go throughout the year, do you have any window into that stability in deposits
sticking around? And then, with the combination of 75% floating rate loan book and still pressure on deposits, is it
reasonable to assume that NII might go down in second quarter forward before stabilizing later in the year and
rising? I know that's a little bit further look into the future, but [indiscernible] (00:21:00).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
I think it's a very reasonable way to frame looking out further into the year. And I think you're right. For us to say
full year numbers at this point, it's just too early. But it is good to think about how the assets and liabilities are
going to react with looming rate cuts. And I think it's helpful to think back on how the impact in NIM occurred with
rates rising. Initially, it was very different than what happened eventually when betas were much higher. And I
think on the way down, we might have a similar situation where the first cuts may be different than the later ones.
And two things jump out in my mind. One is we've never tried to be a price-setter in deposits. Our goal has always
been keep the deposits in the house, and we were very aggressive at following what we saw market pricing was.
And the second thing is that as we get these initial cuts, we could see the market reacting in a way to cheap
deposit costs – deposit yields for clients higher to hold on to deposits. And so, I think initially might be tougher
than what happens eventually. Now, all that said, the volumes matter a lot. And it's obviously been extremely hard
for us to predict where volumes were going to go. And we saw October better than we anticipated. November was
better than October. December was better than November. And so, volumes are going to be critical in what
happens in the first half of the year, and it's just super hard to predict.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
I definitely appreciate that. This one might be a little bit easier, the follow-up on fee operating leverage. I mean,
just by means of pricing alone – or the markets alone, the markets had a strong end to the fourth quarter. So, your
fee run rate should probably be a lot better going into the first quarter and with your comments on even more
sharper discipline on expenses. Do you expect to make some meaningful progress early on in the year in this fee
to expense ratio?

Yeah. You're right to call out that there's a – there is a lift, the launch point higher coming into the year. And I don't
know if I'd say meaningful, but it's definitely higher. And the lag effects will help us as we walk into the year. And
so, that's the math of it. But then more strategically, we do feel positive about the pipeline in both Asset Servicing
and in Wealth Management. And underneath both businesses, our asset management business is incredibly
important. And as Mike mentioned in his commentary, there's some early signs of flows back in. And we always
think, just as we do on deposits, just keep the money in the house – keep the client assets in the house. But if our
asset management business does better, then that helps as well. And so, I think the strategic component is also
we're feeling early signs of some positive movement from an organic perspective.

Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Good morning, Steven.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi. Good morning. So, I was hoping to maybe just unpack like the deposit discussion a bit further and specifically
just get a sense as to how you're thinking through the impact of ongoing Fed QT. It does feel like a lot of the
liquidity in the system has come out of RRP. That's provided a bit of stability – or at least has helped drive better
deposit resiliency over the last six months. But with the RRP expected to be exhausted over the next, call it, three
to four months, just want to get a sense, once that happens, how you expect deposit flows to ultimately trend.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. I'll start and Mike may have thoughts too, because we talk about this a lot and it's more predictive than it is
quantitatively spitting out results frankly. But you're right that – my sense is that the RRP program had a really
significant impact on deposits. And it was effectively competing with banks for deposits. And now that it's come
down, I do think that that's been a help. Now, from here is different. And I think we have to think about the fact
that rate movements are going to also have an impact on how clients think about deposits. And with the deposit
costs having gone up so much in the second half of the year – and again, that was – that had a big impact on
deposit costs and client behavior. We could see that having an impact this year as rates come down. And so, I
think it's not just the RRP program but how clients think about – instead of 5% rates, how they think about 3%
rates and comparing that to maybe more of a risk-on trade. And so, I think we've got to think both about the
program and the rate environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. And I would agree with what Jason said there. And just as there was a transition on the way up with QE,
there's going to be a transition on the way down. Unchartered territory for everyone on QT and how they go about
that and when they might stop more aggressively seeing their portfolio come down. So, I think the timing of that
will matter. And then, also we saw with client behavior that as rates went up, more of the liquidity moved into
Treasuries, and that had an impact on us. And as we come down, I think over time, a lot of the funds that have
moved into Treasuries will start to move into other alternatives. And as Jason said, our objective is to work with
the clients and really try to meet any of those needs and keep the dollars in the house.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
That's great. And just for my follow-up, the duration on the asset side of the balance sheet admittedly has been a
little bit more volatile, especially given some of the repositioning actions you talked about. The asset betas with
rate hikes were quite elevated for you guys and some of your trust peers as well. Just wanted to get a sense as to
what percentage of the asset side of the balance sheet, if we took a snapshot today, is sensitive to movement in
short rates as we do prepare for eventual rate cuts.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
We're going to do it in three buckets. And if you just take cash, obviously, 100% of that; the second, loans and
roughly three-quarters are rate-sensitive. And you think about the securities portfolio – and I'll give you two
numbers to play with. One is the duration is meaningful at now about 1.8 years. But also just the weighted
average maturity of the portfolio, I think, is also helpful, which is a little under 4 years. And we quote this – the
duration of the balance sheet, that's just us doing a weighted average across those effectively just to give a sense
of the impact of the large size of the cash component and the large floating component of the loan book.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
And Jason, could we just clarify what percentage of the securities book today is floating?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. It's about a third of the book is floating – is floating.

Hey, Alex.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, Jason. Hey, Mike. Good morning, everybody. Just building on Steven's questions for a second, I guess
given the fact that rates are expected to come down and you guys have actually been, I guess, shifting the
balance sheet to be maybe a little bit more floating for the right reason, and obviously, been a good trait for NII for
last quarter, this quarter. Any expectations to actually start locking in higher yields going forward and maybe
extending duration a little bit? I know this is pretty quick. You guys have just kind of gone the other way, but the
balance sheet effectively became a little more floating as rates are about to come down. So, just curious how
you're thinking about that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. It's on our mind a lot and as we're talking about it. And we have brought the duration down, and one of the
benefits to that is that it does make us just a lot more flexible, because the markets have been really dynamic.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
And so, there will come a time when I – I anticipate where we would say it's time to step out a little bit. Our bias
over the last year has obviously been to go shorter, and that's played out. I think rates have – the way rates have
played out, we had a view and not materially, but it worked in our favor. But from here, I think we do have to think
about – it's not locking in as much as just taking the downside risk off the table of a dramatic reduction in rates.
And so, there's some component there that we'd say we can naturally hedge against.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
I got you. Makes sense. I wanted to follow up for my second one just around the expense outlook. 2023 was
super noisy. There is a bunch of one-timers obviously. So, I just want to clarify a couple of things.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
So, I guess the ultimate message is that 2024 expense growth expected to be lower than 2023. I think the core
expense growth in 2023 was about 5%. So, I just want to confirm that. And then, the core base you're speaking
to, is it still kind of $5.1 billion to maybe $5.2 billion in sort of core expense base off of which we should think
about 2024?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. So, confirm that 2024 – the 2023 number we think of is 5%, just a little bit less than that, right at about
4.8%, and the – we are working from a base in 2023 of $5.1 billion. And probably worthwhile to invest a minute
and just explain, because you're right, there have been a few things. So, if you walk the reported $5.284 billion,
and then you take out in the year severance-related charges, with two occupancy charges that totaled about $13
million. There was a client capability write-off we mentioned in second quarter, $26 million, FDIC special
assessment $85 million, and then there was a small equipment credit of $4 million in the third quarter that we
mentioned as well. And the severance-related charge in Q2 was $39 million just to make sure I give you the
numbers on everything. And so, let's work – that tells us we'd work from a base of $5.1 billion.

thanks for clarifying the base. That's helpful. You – number one, just to confirm, you did mention that, I think, it
would be inclusive of adjusting for the write-off of the client capability. Just want to confirm that. And just to clarify
the message on the investing, super clear that you're working to drive expense growth lower than you saw in

2023. But you also laid out an uplift of 3% from base pay and software. So, does that represent like a floor to
growth or do you have sufficient levers to offset at least some of that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
It's not a floor, but it does give you a sense of what's already in the 2024 base from which we're working. And so,
we've got to use productivity to get aggressively at that. Some of our productivity work is already reflected in that.
But we've got to do more this year. And we wanted to be super transparent in the things that we already know that
are in the 2024 increase, so that you guys can predict what that level is.

Hey, Mike.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael C. Brown Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. The sequential increase in the noninterest-bearing
deposits, that was a positive to see this quarter. Could you just touch on maybe some of the key drivers there?
Was this supported by some of the new business activity that you referenced in the prepared remarks? And then,
I appreciate the comments on the deposits and the potential for the stability here near-term. But I guess focusing
on the NIBs, can they stabilize at this level either in terms of like an absolute dollar basis or as a percentage of
the total deposits?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
My observation, looking at it, is that it's less percentage-driven and more what is that base. And the reason I
mention it that way is a lot of that NIB, it comes from one of the channels in our institutional business, and it
actually performed better than the rest of the institutional business in looking at it over the last few weeks. And so,
it just tells me that that client – that sub-client channel behaves on its own. And it looks like that has flattened out
somewhat. Not necessarily calling it a plateau at this point, but it certainly behaved a little bit better than the rest
of the institutional book.
And another component is the wealth book, which – that deposit base increased in the quarter. It was – not
dramatically, but it was nice to see that up on average. And obviously, we saw overall the whole deposit book
very flat, but nice to see that the wealth book doing well. Because even though the noninterest-bearing is
12

obviously highly attractive economically, the wealth deposits are very attractive as well, not at zero, but they're
very attractive, and that component did well on the quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael C. Brown Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I guess on the servicing side of the business, I was hoping you could maybe just touch on the competitive
landscape in the alternative asset side of the business. How do you think about maybe that opportunity for
Northern Trust and how are your – if you could just talk about your capabilities today and maybe where you're
investing to take some share in that space?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Mike, so I'll address that. We believe that the alternative space – or broadly speaking, just private markets
is a major opportunity for us on the Asset Servicing side. And that largely follows with what's happening in the
marketplace from an investor perspective. And so, we expect that market to grow, and we think we have the value
proposition that is compelling within that.
You heard in my comments earlier that we've recently won a very large mandate with one of the large private
markets firms, and it was after an exhaustive process that we went through to win that business, very capabilities-
oriented, very global as to the capabilities necessary and the footprint necessary to do it. So, again, it's an area of
focus for us and one where we think we're going to be able to continue to grow as the market grows and as we're
able to take share.

Ryan Kenny Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. I have a question on capital. So, your CET1 ratio, 11.4%, is well above the regulatory
minimum, well above last year's level. And then, we got the comment letter from Basel endgame a couple of days
ago, and there's clearly a lot of industry pushback there. Your earnings generation from NII looked a little bit
higher than consensus expected. So, putting that all together, how should we think about how Northern is
approaching buybacks this year and this quarter? Is there any room to maybe lean in a little bit there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So, you're right in the tee-up of the numbers. There's obviously room. We did a fair amount of buybacks in
the quarter, a little bit more than we do on average, and we're always looking at that relative to other opportunities
we have to invest capital. And so, in the near-term, we're thinking about does it make more sense to invest in
RWA effectively to say we could grow the loan book more or we could do more in FX, we could do more in sec
lending, or do we want to reposition the – take a different repositioning in the securities portfolio. The
repositionings we did this year were all helpful to capital, because in going shorter, we – and out of non-HQLA
into HQLA on that, those were all helpful to capital.
But you also know how closely we look at peers and we take pride in the capital levels we have. We think it's part
of our financial model and our business model and talking to clients and being able to evidence to them how
strong the capital base is. And so, there's definitely room. But we also got to have in mind that Basel endgame,
which you've referenced briefly, it's still unclear. And we did do a comment letter, which you referenced, but it's
unclear what the impacts are going to be. We think we're in good position relative to peers, but want to keep an
eye on that. But we'll also think about additional stock repurchases as we always do given alternatives we have.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan Kenny Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay, great. And can you also update us on your expectations regarding ability and timing to dispose of the Class
B Visa shares and would that potentially have any impact on capital and buybacks outlook?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. So, just for people who don't follow this closely, we own just over 4 million Visa B shares and at the current
exchange rate show that translates to about $1.7 billion. And there's a proposal that is going to be voted on next
week, I think, that would enable the B shareholders to monetize half of the holdings.
So, what are we planning to do? One, at this point, there's nothing to do. The proposal is still outstanding, and
we've got to wait and see what the shareholder vote looks like. Even assuming it passes, there are timing
restrictions to it. But that said, this is not a strategic asset for Northern Trust. And so, you should read into that it's
not something that we're saying we're going to hold on to beyond what the restrictions would enable us to do. And
we're discussing all the options. There's likely going to be a combination of a few tools that we'll take, but early to
give details on that at this point.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Hey, Brian.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks. Hey. Good morning. If I could just clarify, Jason, a couple of things you gave guidance on earlier,
just to make sure I heard it right. The incremental NII from the two portfolio securities sales is $30 million
annualized and that comparison period is 1Q versus 4Q. Is that correct?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. So, you broke up a tiny bit, but I think I'm following where you are. But don't hesitate to tell me if I missed it.
So, the November repositioning helped in the quarter by, call it, $6 million and – but that should be helpful going
forward to the tune of – in the neighborhood of $15 million a quarter. The January repositioning, which we
mentioned for the first time a little while ago, that should help in the quarter about 15 – round numbers, about $15
million a quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
$15 million per quarter, okay. And then, on the expense side, maybe just if we can try to get some more clarity on
the total expense growth. I think you said comp expense being up $50 million to $55 million in 1Q versus 4Q
because of the retirement-eligible options and then employee benefits up $10 million versus 4Q. So, correct me if
I'm wrong on that. And then, just translating that into expense growth through the year, obviously, there's lots of
different levers. But is the idea to try to improve on the 3% expense contribution from that from a total growth
perspective or should we be thinking of expense growth, say, better than 5% – lower than 5%, but potentially
higher than 3%? And can you improve that trust – expense to trust fee ratio in 2024 from 2023?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Yeah. So, couple of things. One, confirm your numbers are right on first quarter and the step-up.
Remember, both of those are fully seasonal, Brian. So, the step-up in first quarter is just because that's what –
that's the booking of our retirement-eligible equity grants. And so, that in and of itself represents the vast majority
of that step-up. And then, similarly, the – we've got a higher payroll tax in first quarter just as we hit the caps on
that level. But both of those numbers come back down for second, third, fourth quarter.
That said, second quarter, we got to build in the base pay adjustments that we referenced, which was that $65
million. That'll be second, third, fourth quarter. So, all that said, the goal is to do better than the roughly 5% we did
this year. The 3% was not seen as – again, back to it, it's not seen as a floor. But also it's – that's a big difference
to go from 5% down to 3%. And so, we're using the productivity to do everything we can to get materially better
than the 5%. But the fact that we're walking in with 3% already in the base is just going to make it difficult.
And so, I think it's – and the last thing I'll mention is, for us, we're anticipating organic growth. That's our – we
target – we have organic growth targets for each of the three businesses, and we want to continue to be a growth
company. That is important. And that drives some expenses, in addition to expectation of what we're doing from a
revenue perspective. And so, it's hard to fine-tune much with – to say is it between 3% and 5%. If we're not doing
15


Northern Trust Corp.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
as well from an organic perspective, we're going to be working really hard to say what else do we do to make sure
we're doing the right thing and we get positive fee operating leverage.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: We'll go next to Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Good morning, Jim.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning – hey. Good morning. Maybe just to follow up on that last comment, just maybe a little more
detail. It seems like organic growth in 2023, it was a tough environment, a little mixed. So, it seems like you're
more optimistic across the board. So, if you can kind of just give us a little more thought, detail on the organic
growth prospects this year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure, Jim. It's Mike. I'll start off here. So, you're absolutely right. We've gone through, I would say, a time period
where the organic growth has definitely been strained and lower than our historical levels. And there's a number
of factors behind that that we've talked about over the preceding earnings calls that relate to client activity, that
relate to some of the outflows that we had in the asset management business, which obviously impacts then
Wealth Management and Asset Servicing. And the reason why we're so positive going forward here on organic
growth, some of those trends, as we talked about, have turned around. And so, we see good inflows into asset
management. So, that aspect of it is a lift going forward to our organic growth, but then also the strategies that we
have in place to drive profitable organic growth.
Where we've been focused as a company is in a couple of areas – or a few areas. One is really looking at the
portfolio of our growth. So, historically, Asset Servicing has been the majority of the organic growth. And looking
forward, we're looking to shift that more towards the more scalable parts of our business. So, Wealth
Management and asset management. That doesn't mean that the Asset Servicing business will not be growing.
It's just we're very focused within that business to the areas that scale the most. So, if you think about the nature
of all the things we do for clients on that front, some of those activities are more scalable, more profitable than
others. And so, we'll lean towards those areas. I mentioned the success we've had with asset owners in the
Americas. A lot of that is that custody and related services on that front. That's some of the more scalable
services that we have.
And it's, again, not to say that we won't be doing the business with the asset managers, so fund services, but
some of those areas are more resource-intensive. And so, we're going to be really disciplined about the types of
business that we take in that require hiring more people, investing more in particular technologies around that.
And then, the last thing I would say just around the organic growth and why we're optimistic on it is the
businesses are working, I would say, much more closely together in how we go to market. So, as we would call it
here, One Northern Trust is our approach to the marketplace. So, it's not separate businesses, but rather to the
16


Northern Trust Corp.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
extent that we're going to approach a client or a prospect to work with them, it's going to include multiple offerings
from across the businesses, particularly asset management with Asset Servicing on the front-end as part of a
bundle that we're offering to the clients.
And then, certainly with Wealth Management as well. You heard in some of our earlier comments here, the
advisory fee component of Wealth Management has been growing nicely through the year. We think that it can
grow at a higher rate. But importantly, the more that we can do on the product side with those clients as well. So,
as we talk about the transitioning with quantitative tightening, for example, and the move out of short-term
Treasuries, to the extent that we can help those clients move into fixed income funds, for example, that's a real
opportunity for us. So, a number of things that we're doing to proactively try to drive that organic growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jim Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
That's really great color, Mike. And maybe just a quick follow-up on deposit pricing, Jason. You talked about still
some pressure on overall deposit costs. Is that lag still on pricing or is that an assumption of a negative mix shift
out of NIBs? What's kind of driving further pricing pressure in deposits?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah, it's lags. And we actually, in fourth quarter, made some agreements on pricing that will come into play in
first quarter more than they did in fourth quarter. And it didn't drive deposit volumes higher in fourth quarter. But it
is something that – as we try to do more fine-tune predictions of what first quarter would look like, it's something
that we factored in. We think the cost could be – cost will be higher. And that's part of the reason why, even
though we ended at $501 million and I indicated that December was better than November and October, we think
we're still going to be flat to down a little bit in first quarter, largely because of that pricing element. And in general,
we do – our view is that, as the Fed does reduce rates, we're going to have client conversations about it. And
again, we're not a price-setter, but highly committed to making sure our clients leave their deposits here.

Hey, Rob.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Wildhack Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Good morning, guys. One more question on expenses. I'm curious how you would approach a hypothetical year
where revenue growth comes in a lot better than expected and what that might mean for expense growth. I guess
the core question is, what takes precedent, your expense to fee ratio or the absolute level of expense growth this
year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
I'll start and Mike may want to add to it. Historically, we'd say we want to grow and – but we have talked about
ensuring that we were committed to more of an absolute number in terms of the expenses, and we've also
committed to more scalable growth. And so, we're already having conversations internally about ensuring that
17


Northern Trust Corp.
(NTRS) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
we're highly disciplined on bringing on business that is scalable. And so, I think that that is a change relative to
how we've thought about it before, where there was more of a desire to bring on business at – always at attractive
margin. But our commitment to scalable growth is going to be – is higher at this point. And that means that the
expenses shouldn't be as volatile with anticipation or even line of sight on new business coming on that brings
with it a high degree of expense. Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So, I agree with what Jason said there. Just to add to your point, we're outside of our range on expense to trust
fee ratio. So, we're trying to drive that into the range. And so, as Jason's indicating, we're leaning towards trying to
get into that range sooner rather than later.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Wildhack Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Okay. Thanks. And then, on NII, I would just love to get your thoughts on the sensitivity there as it relates to
different scenarios from the Fed. What's the impact of, say, one or two Fed cuts this year as opposed to, say, six
Fed cuts?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Those are the scenarios we're looking at. But I come back to this theme, it's just going to depend on how
well we're able to hang on to spread. And we – and they're just been highly variable, and I think our ability to
predict, just over the last couple of quarters, has been really hard. But I feel really good about the volumes that
stayed in place. And so, I think our approach has worked, but it makes – it's going to make it less predictable. It's
the opposite of what we just talked about on the expense side, ironically, where we're saying we want to be more
predictable on the expenses to try and get that expense to trust fee ratio where we want it to be. On the deposit
side, there's more flexibility and more willingness to follow where the market goes to make sure we're holding on
to client assets.

Robert Rutschow Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning – hey. Good morning. This is Rob Rutschow for Mike. Just wanted to follow up on the custody
commentary a little bit more. As we calculated, your fees to assets under custody were down about 5% year-over-
year. You mentioned client outflows. So, how much of that is kind of risk-off versus actual pricing pressure? What
was the new business this year and what's the outlook for pricing pressure versus new business as we look into
2024?

Northern Trust Corp.
(NTRS) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2023 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2024
Yeah. I'll start and then, Jason, you can fill it out. But first of all, I just think you need to take into account that we
are compensated sometimes on the asset level, sometimes on the transaction levels, and transaction volumes
were lower during the year. So, that drove some of the weakness in the custody fees there. From a pricing
perspective, I would say, nothing in particular as far as the competitive environment that is driving custody pricing
to much lower levels, if you will. I would say it's relatively stable on the pricing front there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
And as I look at just the underlying details of how we did, I think you're leaning more toward the Asset Servicing
business. The net new business for the year was – it was positive, and year over – I'm just thinking year-over-year
for the quarter. And Asset Servicing hit its mark on net new business. The issue with the company is some of the
other things happening as we get into transactions, and then what we referenced earlier in our clients going
through their asset levels declining, but much less of a repricing story relative to prior years and the business is
winning. If we just look at their win rate in the market, it is strong. So, a lot of this year, the impact came from
these other dynamics of lower transaction volumes and same number of clients, but less assets.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Rutschow Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. And if I could follow up on Wealth, I guess, can you talk about the competitive dynamic there? And
especially in Global Family Office, you saw a little bit of deceleration in the growth rate. Any changes or any areas
that you're looking to grow either inside the US or out?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. You're right to call it. GFO had a lower – much lower growth rate than it has over the last couple of years.
It's been – the last couple of years have been excellent for that business, and this year was weaker. But we
always talk about the fact that is the spikiest business that we have. Very small number of client activity can lead
to meaningful change. And it's also one of the businesses where, with what happens underneath from an
investment management perspective, can have a meaningful impact on how the business is doing.
So – but we've actually invested heavily in that business. They've got a lot of accomplishments in technology, and
some of the things that they have done with their Wealth Passport, their overall technology platform, we feel, is
industry-leading – it is industry-leading, just the way that they're now interacting with clients from that platform
perspective, what clients are able to do with multiple accounts and reporting and client asset movement, all
coming – and a lot of – and it's all cloud-enabled is what we've done recently. And so, it's highly market-leading
from our view in terms what we're doing, and we're continuing to invest in that business from a technology
perspective. So, there's more coming, which makes us feel very optimistic about what that business is going to do
over the next couple of years.
