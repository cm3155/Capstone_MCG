Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Adrienne. Good afternoon and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our year-end earnings call. 2023
was another record-breaking year for East West. Our highlights include new record levels for revenue, net interest
income, net income, loans and deposits. Our 2023 results speak to the resilience of our business model, the
loyalty of our customers, and the persistence of our bankers.
Despite the turbulence in the earlier half of the year, we grew customer deposits by $1 billion in each of the past
two quarters. We did this by adding 40,000 new deposit accounts over the past year, both consumer and
commercial, and driving our more granular deposit base. Our loan growth was driven by our differentiated
residential mortgage product and the strength of our commercial lending relationships.
Asset quality remained strong and we continue to proactively manage our credit risk. Our 2023 annual net
charge-offs to average loans were just 9 basis points, and nonperforming assets to total asset ratio was just 16
basis points at year end. We continue to deliver industry-leading efficiency supported by our simple, proven
business model and effective branch network. Our efforts drove a 20% adjusted return on average tangible
common equity and a 1.7% return on average assets in 2023.
Looking forward, we remain focused on driving core deposit growth and we are pleased by the early progress on
continued net new customers and balances as we begin 2024. We have started the New Year from a position of

strength. Given our earnings ability, solid credit performance and strong capital levels, I am pleased to announce
that our board of directors has approved a 15% increase to the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.55 per
share.
I will now turn the call over to Chris to provide more details on our fourth quarter financial performance. Chris?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Dominic. Our fourth quarter 2023 net income was $239 million. Excluding the one-time FDIC charge
and securities gains, our Q4 adjusted EPS was $2.02 million.
Turning to loans on slide 4. East West grew total average loans by 9% for the year, reflecting the strength and
scale of our core residential mortgage and commercial real estate platforms. We note that over the last five years,
East West has grown loans at a very healthy 10% compounded annual growth rate.
Demand for residential mortgage remained quite strong. Despite the generally rising rate environment, we
originated $3.5 billion of low-risk, low-LTV mortgages in 2023. And while we expect growth to moderate from Q4's
trend, our pipelines remain resilient going into the first quarter of 2024.
Average CRE balances grew in 2023 as we continued to work with longstanding relationship clients. We saw solid
increases in both multifamily and industrial property lending, while office loans declined. Looking at the Q4 end of
period balances, our fourth quarter growth was driven by an uptick in C&I utilization and continued solid
residential mortgage originations.
Looking forward, assuming the economy moderates into a soft landing, we expect overall loan demand to
moderate as well. We expect our growth will continue to be driven by strong residential mortgage activity and
continued growth in C&I lending, leading to a further and better diversified loan portfolio.
Moving on to deposits. We note that over the last five years, East West has grown deposits faster than loans
overall. Despite volatility in the first half of 2023, East West continued to grow average deposits year-over-year.
We continue to show deposit momentum in the fourth quarter by adding another $1 billion in deposit balances.
Our growth reflects the focus and dedication of our bankers and the loyalty and resilience of our broad-based
customers. Looking forward, we will continue to focus on adding granular, low-cost consumer and business
deposits while continuing to reduce our use of non-core, brokered or wholesale funding.
Turning to net interest income and margin on slide 6. Q4 dollar net interest income increased by 1% to $575
million from third quarter. We held our net interest margin stable at 3.48%. While our $4.25 billion of cash flow
hedges continued to be a net drag on NII in Q4, on a mark-to-market basis some of these forward-looking hedges
are now in the money and expected rate cuts will only make that better.
While these hedges cost us approximately $25 million of NII in the fourth quarter, they're expected to provide
valuable earnings protection as rates decline. Given the current forward curve and consensus economic outlook,
we expect NIM to decline by 3 basis points to 5 basis points in Q1, as deposit costs continue to normalize and
new asset yields continue to flatten out.
We then expect our margin to be further compressed in Q2 and Q3 as a result of the expected rates moving
lower. NIM likely troughed in Q3 and we expect this to begin to rebound thereafter as assets grow, expected

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2024
lower funding costs kick in and the expected positive cash flow benefits from our balance sheet hedges begin to
offset lower asset yields.
Speaking of asset yield, please turn to slide 7. Our expectation for margin resilience is also supported by the
enhanced levels of fixed rate assets in our portfolio at year end. Fixed rate and hybrid loans in their fixed period
represented 42% of our loan portfolio at year end 2023 versus 35% at the beginning of 2022.
Turning to funding cost on slide 8. Our average cost of deposits for the fourth quarter was 260 basis points, up 17
basis points from the third quarter. As Dominic previously mentioned, we remain laser-focused on driving core
deposit growth and growing net new customers and balances as we begin 2024. Looking forward, we are
optimistic about our operational ability to rapidly reprice non-time deposits in a falling rate environment.
Moving on to fees and noninterest income. East West has grown fee income at a 10% annual rate over the past
five years. 2023 fee income growth reflects a continuing strength in our customer derivatives business, lending
fees and foreign exchange income. We note that Q4 saw growth in every fee category.
Moving on to slide 10. Total annual adjusted noninterest expense trends are on the left. Adjusted noninterest
expense has grown 7% annually over the past four years, compared with our 11% annual revenue growth. East
West consistently delivers industry-leading efficiency. The fourth quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was 33.1%,
compared with 31.2% in the prior quarter.
Adjusted noninterest expense was $215 million in the fourth quarter. Comp and benefits did increase $8 million,
reflecting higher commissions and incentive accruals. And other operating expenses did increase $6 million,
reflecting some increased legal expense, realized credit card fraud losses and some advertising expense.
Looking forward, we expect adjusted noninterest expense to increase in the range of 6% to 8% year-over-year,
driven primarily by comp and benefits and partially offset by lower deposit account expense, as earnings credit
and related rate-driven expense pressure begins to ease in a lower rate environment.
I will now turn the call over to Irene for discussion of our asset quality and capital position. Irene?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon to all on the call. As you can see on slide 11, the asset quality of our
portfolio remains broadly stable. During the fourth quarter, we recorded net charge-offs of $20 million or 15 basis
points, a 1 basis point increase from the third quarter. Quarter-over-quarter, non-performing assets as of
December 31 increased modestly by 1 basis point to 16 basis points of total assets.
The criticized loan ratio decreased 14 basis points from September 30 to 1.87% of loans held for investment. The
special mention loans ratio decreased 18 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 77 basis points of total loans held
for investment as of December 31. And the classified loans ratio increased 4 basis points to one-tenth as credit
continued to normalize.
We remain vigilant and proactive in managing our credit risks. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $37
million in the fourth quarter, compared with $42 million for the third quarter.
Turning to slide 12. The allowance for loan losses increased $13 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily reflecting
net loan growth. The allowance for C&I loans increased $9 million, the allowance for commercial real estate loans
5

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2024
increased $4 million, and the allowance for resi mortgage and consumer remained unchanged from the prior
quarter.
The reserve for office loans increased by $2 million to 243 basis points of total office loans. We believe we are
adequately reserved for the content of our loan portfolio given the current economic outlook.
Turning to slide 13. As shown on this slide, all of our capital ratios expanded quarter-over-quarter due to the
strength of our earnings. East West CET1 capital ratio stands at a robust 13.3%, while the tangible common
equity ratio grew 34 basis points to 9.37%. These capital levels place us among the most well-capitalized banks in
the industry. East West's board of directors has declared first quarter 2024 dividends for the company's common
stock, resulting in a 15% increase in the dividend. The quarterly common stock dividend of $0.55 per share will be
payable on February 15, 2024 to stockholders of record on February 2, 2024.
East West repurchased 1.5 million shares of common stock during the fourth quarter of 2023 for $82 million. We
currently have $172 million of repurchase authorization that remained available for future buybacks.
I'll now turn it over to Chris to share our outlook for the 2024 full year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Irene. To summarize, as stated on slide 14, our full year 2024 outlook assumes a softening economy
with a more modest growth profile in 2023 and takes into consideration the year-end forward curve with cuts
assumed to begin in the second quarter. We expect end of period loan growth in this environment to be in the
range of 3% to 5%, driven by moderating demand but duly by a relative strength in our residential mortgage and
C&I lending activity.
We expect net interest income to decline in the range of 4% to 6%, driven by the expected rate cuts. Adjusted
noninterest expense is expected to increase in the range of 6% to 8%, driven again primarily by comp and
benefits and partially offset by lower deposit related expenses.
First quarter net charge-off levels are expected to be in line with the fourth quarter of 2023 with subsequent
quarters increasing modestly as we expect full year net charge-offs will fall within the range of 15 basis points to
25 basis points. We expect our effective tax rate will increase modestly for the full year.
With that recap, now let me turn the call back to Dominic for his closing remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Chris. Let's go to slide 15. As I look back, I'm very proud of our strong performance in 2023, marked
by 18% growth in tangible book value per share year-over-year, and by recognition from S&P Global, Forbes and
Bank Director as a top performing American bank. I also would like to thank our associates for their unwavering
dedication to our clients.
As Chris mentioned, economists are projecting a softening economy and a declining rate environment in 2024.
But at East West, our goals remain the same, which are to help our commercial clients thrive, to meet the savings
and investment needs of our branch customers, and to operate with strong capital and prudent risk management
allowing us to deliver top-tier returns to our shareholders in any environment.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes
from Ebrahim H. Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities-Merrill Lynch
Thank you, and good afternoon.

Good afternoon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities-Merrill Lynch
I guess maybe first question. Hey, Dominic. Maybe first question for Chris just around the NII outlook and the
sensitivity to the rate cut. So it seems like the down 4% to 6% assumes the six rate cuts that were there in the
forward curve. Give us a sense of what if we get zero rate cuts or just get three rate cuts, should we assume
proportionately NII holds up a lot better? And if we don't get rate cuts in through until maybe even May, are you
doing – taking further actions to kind of neutralizing the balance sheet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yes, yes, and yes. So, yes, if there are not as many rate cuts as were projected at year end, NII will do better.
Yes, if rate cuts start later, NII will do better. And yes, we are proactively taking a number of steps to make sure
we manage our sensitivity to rates. But in particular, our focus on deposits is one that we think will yield us some
benefit as we move through the course of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities-Merrill Lynch
Noted. And I guess maybe another question, Dominic, for you. So you managed through last year very strong
results, you have solid capital levels. It feels like there's a fair amount of disruption just across the banking sector,
maybe in terms of people moving loan portfolios, maybe banks up for sale. Just give us a sense in terms of when
you're looking at 2024, how do you see the opportunity set in terms of actually putting investment dollars to work
and capitalizing on the disruption out there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, we actually continue to look into the market and see. To a certain extent, obviously, we all saw what
happened last year that a lot of our larger peers, well, two of them were gone. And then, some of the other peers
are having some financial difficulty or transitioning and whatnot. And so from that, from a competitive landscape, I
think it is marginally better for East West Bank.

But we have always been prudent. And the reason we didn't get into trouble is because we don't try to go all out in
any one particular direction. We're always trying to look at making sure that we have a diversified portfolio. So in
terms of recruiting talents and so forth, we're very selective. We're trying to make sure that there have – there are
talents out there to have the right mindset that fit into the East West culture.
And also they are in the kind of like business that fit into our sweet spot. And then, we will bring them over and
we'll continue to be out there recruiting and looking for the right talents to join us and together with our own
associate who continue to grow. And so we feel that 2024, we cannot predict exactly what the economy is going
to be like. But we do know what East West can do, which is that our team will find a way to continue to bring in
new customers. And we'll be able to continue to help support our existing customers. And with that, we'll be able
to grow deposits, we'll be able to grow loans and also have meaningful fee – diversified fee income. And that's the
plan.

Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
So Ben, I think we missed a good portion of your question, but I think your question was broadly around deposit
betas and how do we think deposit betas unfold? And so I think there's a couple of thoughts here. The first part is
we had a reasonable uptick in deposit beta as rates rose. We would expect to have a reasonable downtick in
deposit pricing as rates fall.
Specifically, we are expecting our deposit beta to be north of 0.5% on the downtick and I think that is a 0.5% that
we recognize we could be more aggressive on, particularly if rate cuts come sooner or faster. And we would note
that we think there's upside to that level if we can get our arms around the pace of cuts that we expect.
And I think that'll be Fed path dependent, but I think we're very comfortable that there's upside to that, if we can
get some clarity on that as we move through the course of the year.

Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
We continue to see 2024 as a year for continued investment in our core businesses and platforms. And so while
we recognize that up 6%, may be a higher number than you've heard from some others, we would also suggest
that a 33% efficiency ratio is a much better start point than you have for many others. And we think that's the right
decision to make for the long-term strength of East West franchise.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Hey, good afternoon, guys. Under NII guide, what are you guys assuming for deposit growth in that and what are
you baking in for the BTFP maturity that's coming up? And if you can just give like a rough estimate, what are you
seeing in terms of what a single cut means from a margin or NII impact at this point, just given the assumptions
that you talked about on deposit betas?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So we fully expect to fund all of our loan growth with core deposit funding. We expect to pay down BTFP
over the course of the year. It rolled over in March. We'll pay down some, we'll roll over some and we'll be exiting
the program in all likelihood by year-end.
And with regard to sort of the rate sensitivity, it's somewhere in the $1.5 million to $2 million per cut per month is
one way to think about it. And I think we're sort of working our way through that. But that's in the zip code.

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Great. And then the pay down of the BTFP, is that – are you expecting to do that with deposits or could you fund
that with some wholesale funding as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, at the March date, we'll pay down some, we'll roll over some. We'll have some securities coming due. We'll
have a variety of other things. If we have better than expected deposit growth, we'll certainly avail ourselves of
that better deposit flow. But whatever is left over, we'll just refinance at the end.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Great. And then maybe one last one on the loan pipeline. It sounded like that was looking pretty good. Obviously,
you're expecting to grow loans really faster than other larger banks. How are you thinking about the composition
of that growth this year? If you can just go through some of the puts and takes on that, it'd be great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, the pipeline strength that we're seeing today is primarily on the residential mortgage side, which has been a
strong contributor to our growth over the past year and we expect we will be the strongest contributor here,
certainly over the near-term.

Hey, a quick follow-up question on the loan growth guide. Given the strength of growth in the back half of the
year, near 10% annualized, I would have thought that it would be maybe a little higher than that. Just wondering
about kind of the C&I activity in the fourth quarter. Was there any sort of pull forward or drawdowns that were
more seasonal in nature that we're kind of normalized here early in the first quarter that would impact the point to
point loan growth outlook?

Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
We did see an uptick in utilization in December. And so that utilization rate, as you may not be surprised, came
back a little bit in January, but nonetheless, we would expect C&I to be additionally contributor to our 2024
growth. But as I just mentioned to Mr. Rochester, I think residential growth will lead the way and from what we're
hearing and seeing from our activity levels on the CRE side, CRE will be muted level of growth net for the year.

It is excluding the one-time items and excluding the tax amortization. So it's already reported adjusted expense,
which is net of those things. So it's a clean operating expense level and we think the clean level comes up a bit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. But there will be a tax amortization hitting the P&L, correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
There will, yeah. And so the tax amortization expense, as you can see from this quarter's numbers, can
sometimes bounce around from quarter-to-quarter. We haven't given you a specific guide for that, but we're also
looking at adopting PAM with the new accounting standard for that, which may move the numbers around
geographically. So there'll probably be a reduction year-over-year in amortization expense and a slight uptick in
the tax rate as a result. But those two will net out to the bottom line.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q

Got you. Okay. Thanks for clearing that up. And then just switching to capital, just thoughts on buyback appetite

Hi. Good afternoon. On the NIM trough in the second half of 2024 is a little later than what others are suggesting.
You know, hear your comments on the 50% beta on the downside. But are you modelling some sort of lag into
your deposit betas on the way down because I know you also mentioned that the NIM should rebound in 2025
after the lower funding costs kick in? So I was wondering if there is a little bit of a lag there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
There's a little bit of a lag, I would say, driven by the fact that you have to remember we have a fair amount of
CDs on the books. And so those CDs, for example, our Lunar CDs special, that's in the market today, will be in
place for the next six months. So we'll book those here January and February. They'll be with us until July,
August. And so there'll be a bit of a lag because of the CDs that we're pricing today versus what will happen.
So again, depending on the timing and the pace of rate cuts, we could outperform that. And certainly, as those roll
over six months from now, we would expect to fully participate in the benefit of those lower funding costs at that
point in time.

Great. And maybe flipping over to credit, there remain a lot of concerns around California commercial real estate.
Can you talk about why your book is different and also what you're hearing from borrowers right now and how
negotiations are going, given that – given the outlook for lower rates coming up?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, thanks. That's a great question. And as you can see from what we've reported, when we look at the
criticized, classified assets, those ratios, the nonperforming loan ratios, the criticized loans are down,
nonperforming loans are down. We're pleased with that as we look at the different categories, office, multifamily,
etcetera, within CRE. We're comfortable with the loan grades. We're also very pleased to see that there are not a
lot of new problem loans that are coming up.
So overall, these conversations with customers, certainly there are some that we're working through, but it's very
manageable at this point and we're very pleased to see that. All the efforts and work that we went through the last
couple of years to shore up borrowers have them pay down, have them swap by cap, those are all things that we
see as positive today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Also, as we highlighted in the previous calls before that we don't have that many loans mature, well, neither in
2023 nor in 2024, a very small percentage of loans coming due. So we actually really don't have much opportunity
to have too many conversation with our customers in terms of dealing with some of the challenge when it comes
to refinancing.
And keep in mind that we have very low LTV and our portfolio is quite granular. So I think that's the reason why
our portfolio so far stands up really well versus some of the other banks.

Got it. And sorry if I missed it, but did you update what your reserve levels were on CRE office? And if it's still
around 2.3% or so as it was last quarter, can you talk about what keeps you comfortable with that level of
reserves?

Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
It's on page 12 of the slide deck, and it was 2.43% at year end, which is up obviously, from the 2.3% you cited.

[indiscernible] (00:34:55) Yeah, office and all of CRE, we have a rigorous process where we go through the
portfolios, our RMs, our team leader, credit supervision, all work together. And I think as we're going through
these loan reviews on a regular basis and the cash flows from the clients, the properties, those are all things that
help us and the cash quite candidly and the network, many of our borrowers and [indiscernible] (00:35:25) are all

Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Matthew Clark with Piper Sandler. Please go
ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for the questions. First one just around deposits. If you can speak to your outlook
on non-interest-bearing down here this quarter, just your expectation on where that might trough relative to the
mix and then it also looks like your Chinese New Year special is 5.25%, at least on your website. So just thoughts
there around kind of growth going forward. Is it going to continue to be dominated by CDs?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
In the near term, we expect CD growth certainly in the first quarter to be a significant contributor. Our current
Lunar CD special will attract good flows. It's been out there for about a week and the early read on that has been
very positive, both on the consumer side and in the private banking client base. So we're encouraged by that. And
that will result partly in some of the deposit compression we expect to see in the first quarter.
With regard to overall levels of non-interest-bearing demand accounts, we have previously bottomed out in the
high-20s. We were at 27.8% at sort of a low point. We think we are trending in that level today and we think that is
a relative benchmark from which we will grow from over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then just on some spot rates, it looks like that slide is no longer in there that detail give us spot rate on
deposits at year end. And then just a related question – well, on the other side, on the resi mortgage book, you
show a rate sheet price for 30-year fixed is 7.88%, your portfolio is at 5.49,% which obviously includes hybrids.
But can you give us a sense for kind of the spot rate on that book as well? You would think you get some decent
lift out of that rate. The two questions within there, I'm sorry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So I would say we have started to see, aside from the CDs, saw the deposit rates flatten out and some
even start to trend lower. And on the mortgages, yes, it was 7.88% at year end and it's in the 7.50% zone as we
sit here today.

Andrew Terrell Q

Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, everybody.

Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Good afternoon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
I wanted to circle back to the expense guidance just a little bit. Can you talk maybe, Chris, just about how we
should expect the expense run rate to progress throughout the year? It feels like we could see kind of a seasonal
bump earlier in the year and then kind of run rate moderation into the back half, especially if we're to get the
forward curve to play out and you get that relief on the deposit costs. So any color on kind of the run rate
throughout the year on expenses will be helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I think you call that correctly. So we're not going to see a material savings in deposit related costs in the first
quarter, absent some Fed rate action and maybe even a slight delay in the second quarter. So those cost savings
and those benefits will really come in the third and fourth quarter. And on the other side, we are going to see an
increase in our comp and benefit expense as we move through the first quarter, as we go through the normal
round of salary adjustments that we do here every year. And so as those numbers roll through, which will pick up
at the end of the first quarter, they'll impact expenses a little bit in the first quarter and then we'll see the offsets
coming in as rates decline later in the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay, great. I appreciate it. And if I could also ask, just as we think about maybe the opportunity for some of the
BTFP reduction that you talked about earlier, can you just remind us the cash flow you'd expect off the bond book
coming in 2024?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Roughly $0.25 billion or $250 million a quarter.

Dominic Ng A

Good afternoon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
So on the strong C&I loan growth in the quarter and I didn't see this in the deck, but could you comment on what
the utilization levels were? And then just give us your expectations for utilization levels? And if we could
potentially see maybe [indiscernible] (00:40:35) uptick if rates come down from.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
The utilization level was 67% at year end. I think when we look about, when we think about uptick, it's a demand
dependent question though, and we would say in a softening economy, we don't expect demand to run away with
that number in 2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then lastly, just on the hedges you have and then [indiscernible] (00:41:05) you have, how do you
currently feel about your position? And are you looking to potentially add more?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. I feel we certainly got comfort in the fourth quarter that our forward starting hedges were a good call. As I
mentioned in my comments, some of them are already in the money, so you don't usually put a trade on
expecting to be in the money in the same quarter. But I'm glad we did and we're looking forward to an outlook that
should have those cash flowing as we move to the end of the year, which is always a wonderful thing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q

Hey, good afternoon, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Good afternoon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I just wanted to follow up on a couple of things real quick on the NII, the cash flow hedges, are there any
maturities through 2025 on the swaps that we need to be aware of? And then you said earlier that you expect that
the 0.5 deposit beta on the way down, just wanted to clarify if that was 50% interest-bearing deposit beta on the
way down through 4Q 2024. Is that a correct interpretation?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, that will – we will save at least half of every move in the Fed funds rate that the Fed engineers in the form
of reduced deposit costs collectively across our deposit base on the interest-bearing deposits. With regard to the
cash flow hedges, there really are no material maturities in 2024. However, two of our earliest or oldest trades will
actually mature early in 2025, and there are two of the lowest strike points. So it gets better as we move into
2025.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Do you happen to have the dollar amount of those two hedges?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, those two hedges are both underwater at $2 billion. And so they're currently part of the drag. And as we
move through 2024, obviously as rates decline, they incrementally improve as well. But when they go away,
there'll be probably a net pickup in 2025 in the first quarter.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2024
Okay. And then, Chris, my last one, I just wanted to clarify on the tax stuff. We've seen a couple other banks I
think adopt that this earnings season where I think effectively the amortization almost went to zero and it's going
to show up in a higher tax rate. Just wanted to ask if you guys adopted that treatment, should we expect
something similar? And if so, you know, I know that you guys have some lumpy amortization. So would that kind
of introduce quarter-to-quarter kind of peaks and valleys in the tax rate itself?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So our goal in adopting PAM will be to dampen out the volatility that you've seen, to introduce a greater
level of stability. And it will help us on certain of the tax credits. However, on those tax credits, such as the energy
tax credits that we placed into service as project completed basis, that level of volatility from when the projects get
placed in a service will continue to be with us and will continue to flow as amortization in sort of above the line.
So we will not go to zero. It will be dampened and reduced and it will be both a function of how much we do in the
different types of credits and how we moderate that activity as we think about making this a less volatile
component of our expense stream moving forward. And our goal is to make it...

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good afternoon. How should we think about the – how should we think about the interplay of lower interest
rates in your residential product? Is that seems pretty rate agnostic? Does demand actually pick up as rates fall?
And then just maybe talk more broadly, what factors impact that line item most?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, well, I think it's a relatively unique product that really cater to our core Asian-American customers. And we
always think that the rate is not anywhere, I guess, sensitive, like these traditional Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac type
of products. So we feel pretty good about, even when rate starts going down, the rate reduction from our home
mortgages would not be going in the same proportionally at higher pace like the normal products in the market.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Securities-Merrill Lynch
Yeah, thank you. Just another question in terms of when you think about deposit liquidity, the loan-to-deposit ratio
around 93%, just structurally, do you expect the bank will operate with a 90% plus loan-to-deposit ratio more or
less or do you see that as resetting lower? And on the assets side, do you expect these as to run with the larger
securities book, mortgage related securities, etcetera, even though you fall well below the $100 billion threshold
that the Fed has kind of identified as the dividing line? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I think broadly the answers are yes and yes. Yes, we expect to operate in sort of the lower 90s from a loan-to-
deposit ratio. We think that's a comfortable place to be. And over time, yes, it's likely our portfolio will migrate to
be more HQLA-like in profile.
