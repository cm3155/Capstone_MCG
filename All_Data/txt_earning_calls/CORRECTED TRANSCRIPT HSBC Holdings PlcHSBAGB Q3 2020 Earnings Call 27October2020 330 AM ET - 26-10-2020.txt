MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Investors and Analysts Conference Call for
HSBC Holdings Plc's Earnings Release for 3Q 2020. For your information, this conference is being recorded.
At this time, I will hand the call over to your host, Mr. Noel Quinn, Group Chief Executive.

Noel Quinn
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, and good morning in London, good afternoon in Hong Kong, and thank you all for joining us. Let me
start by saying that I'm pleased with our third quarter performance and the way that our business and our people
have continued to respond to a challenging environment. We're doing all we can to support our customers,
communities, and colleagues through the ebb and flow of COVID restrictions, and are committed to helping them
manage the uncertainty that remains.
As far as our business is concerned, we are more optimistic than when we last spoke in July. Economic forecasts
are looking brighter, particularly in Asia. As you can see from our Q3 results, expected credit losses have now
stabilized. And we've got a clear plan to accelerate growth and adapt the business to the ultra-low interest rate
environment.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2020
Looking further ahead, we are also committed to helping our clients make the transition to a low carbon economy.
You'll have seen our announcement two weeks ago that we're aiming to align our financed emissions to the Paris
agreement goal to achieve net zero by 2050 or sooner. The COVID-19 pandemic has been a huge wakeup call
for us all. And a climate crisis has the potential to be much more drastic in its consequences and longevity. We're,
therefore, stepping up support for our clients in a material way, as we work together to build a thriving low carbon
economy and focus in every part of our business on helping achieve that goal.
Turning to our third quarter performance. These were promising results, set against the continuing economic
impacts of COVID-19, with significantly smaller expected credit losses, good strategic progress, a growing capital
ratio, good customer retention and an improved economic outlook. Our Asia businesses continue to show good
resilience, contributing $3.2 billion of reported pre-tax profit. And Global Markets grew adjusted revenue by 16%
versus last year's third quarter.
Our capital markets revenue is up 21% year-to-date on the back of strong collaboration across Commercial
Banking and Global Banking and Markets. And our Global Markets revenues are up 31% year-to-date, largely in
the areas we have targeted for continued investment. Our profitability was challenged by the impact of interest
rate reductions earlier in the year on our deposit franchises across all our global businesses.
As a result, reported pre-tax profits of $3.1 billion were down 36% and adjusted profits were down 21% on last
year's third quarter. ECLs of $785 million were down significantly on the previous two quarters and broadly stable
versus the same period last year. We maintained a firm grip on costs, down 3% on last year's third quarter, with
an ambition to go further than previously promised. Deposits of $1.6 trillion were 12% higher than last year's third
quarter. We strengthened our capital ratio further to 15.6%. And despite headwinds, we made good progress in
reducing risk-weighted assets in low-returning areas and reducing our cost base in a sustainable way.
Turning to slide 3. The revenue impact of lower-for-longer interest rates is going to continue over coming quarters
as the impact of interest rate cuts unwinds through the P&L. In response, we're accelerating all areas of our
strategy with a particular focus on boosting sustainable non-interest income and going further on costs. The three
main levers for this are going to be an acceleration and an increase in our investment in and across Asia; faster
digitization through higher levels of technology investments; and the extensive restructuring of the businesses we
talked about in February.
Starting with Asia. As you can see from slide 4, Asia is rebounding strongly, much more than the rest of the world.
Given our ability to connect the world to Asia and support growth in the region, our Asian opportunity is growing
and we're stepping up the investment to capture it. Previously, just under half of our growth investment was aimed
at Asia. Now, a large majority of our future growth investment will go to growing our Asia wealth, wholesale, and
sustainability franchises, as well as reinforcing our position in Hong Kong and extending our position across the
Greater Bay Area and South Asia.
In the last 12 months, Asia's share of group risk-weighted assets increased by 3 percentage points to 44% and
that number will keep growing as we reallocate additional capital to the region as a whole. Our recent investments
have helped launch new initiatives aimed at supporting both our clients and business growth. These include
VisionGo, a platform connecting SME service providers and customers in Hong Kong, which has onboarded more
than 8,000 members since its launch in April; Pinnacle, supported by its new Fintech subsidiary, which is a first for
a foreign financial institution in China; and in Southeast Asia, a new capability to onboard SMEs to multiple
markets, simultaneously, as well as a new multi-currency digital wallet for international SMEs piloted by GLCM
business in Singapore.

Our Asian franchise saw more good growth in the quarter with higher deposits and stable lending, supported by
strong credit quality. But we can go much further and we're backing up our ambition with investment to match.
Turning to slide 5, our technology investment is critical, not just to provide new capabilities to our customers, but
also to boost the efficiency and reduce long-term costs. For that reason, we'll maintain technology investment
throughout the cycle, even as we reduce spending elsewhere. HSBC is already a substantially digital bank. A
large proportion of our global payments already flow through digital channels. And downloads of HSBCnet are up
155% for the first nine months of the year. But we have further opportunities to meet growing market need for
sophisticated, robust, rapid payment solutions, and to lead our industry in applying digital solutions to analog
services, like trade.
Despite the current economic environment, we forecast to spend more in 2020 on technology than ever before,
including investments to further digitize our key retail and wealth platforms; enhance transaction banking for high-
net worth clients in Asia; build the new trade services' operating model fit for a digital future; build and expand
HSBC Kinetic, a UK mobile SME bank that uses cloud to deliver a faster, same-day service for customers; and
launch and enhance HSBC Evolve, a new FX execution platform, enabling greater collaboration and better digital
solutions for large and small corporate clients. This investment is helping to redesign our cost base, while building
the future of HSBC, and we won't sacrifice it for short-term gain.
Moving to slide 6, we're making good progress in restructuring our US and European businesses, achieving $41
billion of RWA saves, largely through actions in Global Banking and Markets, and around $600 million of cost
program savings so far this year.
In the US, Michael Roberts and the team have already reduced RWAs by 8% year-on-year, adjusted costs by 7%,
FTEs by 11%, and branches by more than 30%. I'm pleased with his progress so far. But given the current
economic climate, we are looking at options to accelerate. We'll provide an update on this at our full year results
in February.
In our non-ring-fenced bank in the UK and Europe, Nuno Matos and the team have delivered more than $18
billion of gross RWA saves, reduced FTEs and contractors by 7%, and initiated plans to reduce Global Banking
and Market FTEs in our European hub in France by 38%. The strategic review of our French retail operations is
ongoing but nearing completion. We will announce the outcome by our full-year results in February.
In the meantime, we have announced the acquisition of the minority interest in HSBC Germany, enabling us to
fully integrate the largest and most export-orientated European market into our strategy and business model. The
combination of our current progress and increased ambition means that we now expect to exceed our $100 billion
RWA gross reduction target in 2022 with around $50 billion of that total expected by the end of 2020.
In summary then, our 2020 to 2022 transformation plan is fully on track, and we'll go further and faster wherever
we can. We are pushing harder on costs and now expect to beat our target to reduce group costs to $31 billion or
lower in 2022. We expect to achieve around $50 billion of low-performing RWA gross reductions by the end of
2020 and to exceed our $100 billion target by the end of 2022.
We will provide an update on our plans for our France and US businesses by our full year results, and we'll
provide an update on our dividend policy in February. We are working hard to get back to being able to pay
dividends, and we seek to pay a conservative dividend if circumstances allow with respect to the 2020 financial
year. The board's decision on whether to pay a dividend will depend on economic conditions in early 2021 and be
subject to regulatory consultation.

With that, I'll pass over to Ewen to go through the numbers.

Ewen James Stevenson
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks, Noel, and good morning or afternoon, all. Against the continuing economic impact of COVID-19, these
were a decent set of results, which coupled with further good progress against our strategic objectives, additional
strengthening in our core Tier 1 ratio, and tail risks in aggregate having diminished over recent months, have Noel
and I in a more optimistic mood than last time we spoke at our second quarter results. Post-tax profits of $2 billion
were down 46% versus the third quarter last year, were up materially on a weak second quarter.
Adjusted revenues were down 10%, mainly reflecting the impact of interest rate reductions, which impacted all of
our global businesses and particularly our deposit franchises. Near zero interest rates will be a persistent revenue
shock to our business over the next few years. We're actively adjusting our business model to address this,
building sources of non-interest income, implementing asset side repricing where we can, adjusting the revenue
model for some product and customer segments, and materially reducing our cost structure through digitization
and automation.
ECL were significantly lower than the second quarter at $785 million or 30 basis points of gross loans, with Stage
1 and Stage 2 allowances broadly unchanged. With ECLs at $7.6 billion for the first nine months, we're now
guiding to the lower end of our previously announced $8 billion to $13 billion range for the full year.
We're continuing to take action on costs. Our adjusted operating costs fell by 3% against the third quarter of last
year and down 4% year-to-date. Our balance sheet metrics continue to improve. Our core Tier 1 ratio was up a
further 60 basis points to 15.6% in the quarter. And customer deposits and lending were broadly stable from the
second quarter with deposits up 12% or $164 billion year-on-year. Our tangible net asset value per share of $7.55
was up $0.21 on the second quarter due to both retained profits and currency movements.
Turning to slide 10 and looking across the three global businesses. In Wealth and Personal Banking, revenues
were down 13% with retail banking revenues falling by just under $1 billion due largely to the impact of falling
interest rates on deposit margins. At a headline level, Wealth Management revenues grew by $177 million, but
excluding positive market impacts in insurance manufacturing, were down 8% due mainly to lower insurance new
business volumes.
Commercial Banking revenues were 17% lower due mainly to the impact of lower margins on global liquidity and
cash management. In Global Banking and Markets, revenues were up 3% despite the impact of lower interest
rates. Global Markets grew by 16%, reflecting continued good performance in credit and FX. Equity revenues also
increased by 39%.
Looking forward, assuming economies continue to rebound from COVID-19 lows, we would expect some increase
in corporate investment and loan growth from the low levels seen in second and third quarters this year. We also
expect Global Markets revenues to now normalize as volatility reduces and corporates complete their bond and
equity fundraisings. Also don't forget, the fourth quarter is normally a seasonally weaker quarter for revenues for
us in both Global Markets and Wealth.
On slide 11, net interest income was $6.5 billion, that's down 6% against the second quarter The net interest
margin was 120 basis points, down 13% on the second quarter – 13 basis point, sorry, reflecting the continuing
5

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2020
impact of near zero interest rates, with our Asian franchise, in particular, seeing material deposit spread
compression, the UK ring-fenced bank NIM was stable quarter-on-quarter excluding significant items.
As we look forward and assuming interest rates remain unchanged, we expect further modest net interest income
headwinds in the fourth quarter, with some quarter-on-quarter stabilization from there. We still expect
approximately $3 billion lower net interest income in 2020 versus 2019.
On the next slide, given the forward outlook for net interest income, we're focused on building our non-interest
income revenues. We've already substantial fee income businesses to invest in, particularly in wealth and private
banking. We're also one of the global leaders in FX and are increasingly building out our strength into Asia for
global markets and global banking.
We're also looking at new revenue models in other areas such as global liquidity and cash management and retail
banking, that have previously relied on deposit spreads to drive economic returns. Fee income showed some
recovery in the third quarter from the COVID-related lows seen earlier in the year, up 4% versus the second
quarter.
Turning to slide 13, adjusted operating costs were 3% lower than the third quarter in 2019 and down 4% for the
first nine months. This continues to reflect the impact of our cost reduction actions and lower spending on
discretionary cost line items as a result of COVID-19. Relative to the plan we announced in February, we now
plan to exceed our cost targets set for 2022 with gross cost savings exceeding our previously announced $4.5
billion in that year, while still sustaining investment in technology spending in areas of focus.
In part, this reflects changed customer and employee behavior as a result of COVID-19, namely substantially
increased digital engagement from our customers and using the benefits of technology to adopt a hybrid working
model for most of our employees with materially lower internal travel requirements going forward.
These customer and employee trends are also consistent with our sustainability goals, opening up further
opportunities to materially reduce our own carbon footprint, in line with our commitment to be net zero
operationally by 2030. To help achieve these additional cost savings, we now plan to spend more than the $6
billion in cost to achieve by 2022 with around $1.6 billion of the total expected to be spent in 2020. We'll provide a
more detailed and quantified plan in February when we announce our full-year results.
On the next slide, ECLs were much lower than first half trends, some $785 million or 30 basis points of gross
loans. This reflects a more stable economic outlook and a significant reserve build in the first half, while overall
ECL allowances remained broadly unchanged. The Stage 1 and Stage 2 P&L charge for the year-to-date is
around $4.2 billion, of which just $300 million was incurred in the third quarter. The Stage 3 charge for the quarter
was around $500 million relating primarily to a small number of wholesale exposures across various sectors and a
stable level of retail defaults. This was partially offset by $300 million of releases relating to pre-COVID-19 cases.
The $785 million ECL charge, we believe, is unusually low at this point in the economic cycle, benefiting from
releases. So, I would discourage you from using this as a new baseline. While ECLs have started to stabilize, we
do still expect them to remain higher-than-normalized levels over the coming quarters. With ECLs at $7.6 billion
for the first nine months, for 2020 as a whole, we now expect to be towards the lower end of the $8 billion to $13
billion range, although uncertainties remain around the COVID-19 and Brexit, in particular.
On slide 15, our core Tier 1 ratio at the end of the third quarter was 15.6%, up 60 basis points in the quarter. This
was driven by RWA reductions on a constant currency basis, profit generation and FX translation differences.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2020
Excluding FX movements, RWAs fell by $11.8 billion, primarily as a result of our risk-weighted asset reduction
program. As previously signaled at the second quarter and relative to guidance we gave in February, we've made
good progress this year on reducing portfolios of higher stress and enhancing capital levels at the holding
company. As such, we now expect to be at a target of 14% to 14.5% core Tier 1 ratio when we can begin to
normalize our core Tier 1 position again.
On slide 16, we're making good progress against our $100 billion gross reduction target of lower-returning risk-
weighted assets by the end of 2022. For the first nine months, we've achieved $41.5 billion and expect to achieve
approximately half of the $100 billion target by year-end. As a result, we now expect to exceed this target, and to
do so without exceeding our $1.2 billion spend target that we announced in February.
So, in summary, against the backdrop of COVID-19, this was a decent quarter for us, another resilient Asian
performance and a decent quarter for fixed income, a more optimistic credit outlook, and further progress on cost
reduction and core Tier 1 build. As we look out, without discounting the continuing high levels of uncertainty, we
think the combination of tail risks has diminished relative to the last quarter and, therefore, we're now more
confident on the outlook.
We recognize that we still got a tough period ahead of us given the very material impact of near zero interest
rates over the next few years, coupled with a gradual recovery in customer activity in some segments from
COVID-19 lows, but we think the building blocks are now being put in place for a substantially enhanced returns
in the coming years: a changed revenue model that will be less reliant on deposit spreads, a normalization of
credit costs from 2020 highs, lower operating costs using the benefits of digitalization and automation, and
increased confidence in being able to operate the bank of reduced capital levels once the economic environment
stabilizes.
Noel and I are very focused on the path back to paying dividends. With a core Tier 1 ratio of 15.6% relative to a
target of 14% to 14.5%, we're now accruing meaningful capital buffers. However, I would caution about getting
ahead of yourselves on distributions. When we start, we'll start conservatively and look to build sustainably from
there.
With that, Sharon, if we could please open up for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Stevenson. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Raul
Sinha from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Hi, Raul.

Good morning, Noel. Good morning, Ewen.

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Raul Sinha Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Afternoon. A couple of questions from my side, I guess, starting off just on the NIM and NII trajectory, couple of
points related to that. One, if you could talk a little bit about the HBAP NIM outlook. Obviously had quite a big fall
in the quarter. And then related to that, if you could elaborate a little bit in terms of what you expect within your
sort of planning assumptions for HIBOR. Are you expecting HIBOR to sort of stabilize around these levels, or are
you still thinking that we are going to converge towards US dollar LIBOR, which is obviously someway below
where HIBOR is?
And the second one, I guess, a little bit more broader in terms of the areas where you're tweaking your
transformation program and you've obviously talked about that a little bit. I was particularly interested in wealth
management and insurance in terms of what other growth initiatives you can focus to make a meaningful
contribution, given where your plan was when you announced it and where we are today.
And you've, obviously, got a big deficit in terms of revenues. So any, sort of, commentary on wealth management
and insurance, sort of, material growth opportunities would be really helpful. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Okay. I'll take the second question, but I'll ask Ewen to answer the first part of the question, if that's okay?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Sure. On NIM, Raul, a few things. I mean, as you know, the HBAP book is relatively short-dated. So, we did see a
material contraction in HIBOR. I think it was down over 60 basis points quarter-on-quarter. And as a result, that
translates very quickly within quarter into the net interest margin. As we look out, I've been here for seven or eight
8

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2020
quarters now, trying to predict the path of HIBOR has always been difficult. But we do think that we've seen, for
the time being, a bottoming and it's been a bit higher so far in October.
Again, that will translate to a stabilization, I think, in Hong Kong, and possibly a recovery. But if we translate all of
that into an outlook for 2021 on an aggregate level, I think, we're broadly, as we sit today, comfortable with where
consensus is or a range around consensus.

Raul Sinha Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Okay. With respect to wealth management in Asia, we started our journey on there of more rapid expansion
actually before we announced the results in February or the update in February. We've been growing our market
share in insurance in Hong Kong throughout 2019 and have continued that journey in 2020, and intend to
continue to invest in that business. And we're seeing very good results from that activity.
We've reclaimed a lot of market share on our insurance business in Hong Kong and we'll continue to invest in that
business. We're looking to expand our insurance proposition beyond Hong Kong into other markets, Singapore,
India, and in China. With respect to the broader wealth agenda, we again started a program of expansion of our
private banking in Asia, increasing the number of relationship managers we have on the ground, the product
capability in Hong Kong. We want to take that further across into South Asia and into China.
And then, more recently, we've talked about the investment we've made in Pinnacle, which is a wealth
management platform in China, which is a combination of around about an extra 2,000 to 3,000 salespeople
based in China serving the wealth management needs of the China population. We expect to put those people on
the ground over the next two to three years. But we're also building a technology platform to provide those
salespeople with a product capability to serve the market as well.
So, we see that as an area of growth and further investment. It will be protect Hong Kong and continue to take
market share in Hong Kong, penetrate into China and expand across the South Asia.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Raul Sinha Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Given the amount of capital you've built, would you consider inorganic opportunities as well in this area?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I think we always look at both organic and inorganic. You should always base a strategy on an organic plan first,
which is what we're doing. But we're open-minded as to where the right opportunities for growth will come.

Operator: Thank you. We will now take our next question. And the question comes from Martin Leitgeb from
Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin Leitgeb Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs International
Yes. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Good morning, Martin.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin Leitgeb Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs International
Yes. Good morning, Ewen. Good morning, Noel. My first question is in terms of how should we think about capital
progression from here. So, obviously, the very strong brand in terms of a 15.6% or 15.4% excluding transitional
impacts. And to your comments on dividend, dividend being conservative from here, does that mean that over the
near to medium term, we should expect HSBC to run over and above the 14% to 14.5% threshold, or do you see
opportunities in the way either to deploy more for growth or deploy more for returns as I think when the economic
outlook normalizes?
And the second question, I was just wondering if you could give us a feel how broad the strategic reviews you're
currently undertaking? The strategy laid out back in February, obviously, was before the pandemic unfolded. How
broad a strategic review are you currently undertaking both in terms of potentially addressing lower return areas,
but also with regards to future areas of growth for the group? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Okay. I'll take the second question and ask Ewen to cover the first.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
So, on capital and how we think about it, Martin, I guess a few things. Firstly, in terms of today's ratio, just to put a
couple of qualifiers around it, I mean, firstly in Q4, as you know, we would typically expect core Tier 1 ratio to fall
in the fourth quarter for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the earnings are, obviously, impacted in the fourth quarter by
the UK bank levy by seasonally lower global markets and wealth revenues. And we signaled, I think, as part of my
comments earlier that we expect to have a higher CTA charge, cost-to-achieve restructuring cost charge in the
fourth quarter relative to what we saw the run rate in the first three quarters.
And we also do still expect some RWA pressure coming from ratings migration, albeit we've been continuously
surprised this year about the degree of ratings migration, which is being less than we might have anticipated. We
also get in our ratios some benefit from COVID-19 regulatory relief currently. That's around 20 basis points. But I
think the regulators are always going to back out of their numbers when they look at our capital ratios and think
about excess that we've got.
And I think going into 2021, we're always going to want to have a buffer for contingency given 2021 will continue
to be relatively uncertain, as we said today. I do think that if you went back to the start of the year and you think
about what we're managing to in our capital base is really two things. One is the degree of stress that we're
10


HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2020 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2020
running as a bank and we do think the restructuring plan that we've announced and the areas that its targeting is
going after some of the highest risk portfolios we have in the bank. So, over the next few years, we think the
aggregate level of stress you'll see from us getting reported in the annual stress testing cycle will reduce.
And secondly, as I think you're aware, we've been holding excess capital in some of our subsidiaries, for
example, in the US. And as we continue to restructure, I think we'll be able to get more of that capital back to the
group. So, as a result, we think that we can manage the bank in the medium term to 14% and 14.5%. I think we
should aspire to do better than that, but that aspiration, I think, has to be very much premised over the medium
term with us making serious inroads into reducing the gross level of stress that exists in the bank. I'm confident
we can get there, but I wouldn't bake it into your numbers today.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
And on the second part of your question, we recognize that it's a – the lower interest rate environment is a very
material drag on revenue and that it will be a hardened road to recover that lost revenue. I also fully recognize
there's no one silver bullet to addressing that gap. It has to be a combination of growth from new areas of
investment, particularly fee income-generating activities, such as I talked about earlier; wealth in Asia, across the
board range, mass affluent, private banking, and asset management insurance; growth from our transaction
banking business and the fee income generation from that in foreign exchange trade and payments and cash
management; and growth of our balance sheet, particularly in Asia, where I do believe there's still growth potential
over the medium term for the asset side of the book.
But we're also going to be looking up at pricing, pricing of our asset book and pricing of our fee income. I think it's
going to be a combination of those activities, coupled with a continued focus on prudent cost management with an
expectation, as Ewen said, to exceed our 2022 target of $31 billion. So, it will be a combination of those things.
And if I think back to the GFC, there was no one single solution to rebooting revenue post the GFC. It was a
combination of things and we're going to be very much focused on those same activities this time around.
Next question, please.

Hi, everybody. I just wanted to ask about the balance sheet and cash. Your cash position has grown again this
quarter. You're up $130 billion since the end of last year. I just wondered what can you do to help manage that
cash position to help boost the NIM or offset the pressure on the NIM, or should we assume you're just going to
run with structurally very high levels of cash in your liquidity management in the future?

Well, I'll give a quick instinctive reaction that, Manus. I mean, I'm a strong believer in a strong balance sheet and a
very liquid balance sheet. So, I understand that at the moment that liquidity is not earning a NIM. But in the middle
of a quite a severe economic crisis, it's good to have a very strong liquidity position and that's been the
cornerstone of HSBC for many years. And it then allows us to have the strength to continue to invest in growth of
the asset side of the balance sheet as that growth reemerges in the economy, and be cognizant of the fact that
Asia seems to become an out of the COVID crisis faster than the rest of the world. Therefore, I expect growth
opportunities to reemerge in Asia. So although that liquidity is not earning money in its own right, it has the
potential to earn money for us on the asset side of the balance sheet. And it gives us the comfort to continue to
make investment decisions, in that we have a strong balance sheet, both liquidity and capital. But Ewen, do you
want to comment on [ph] those (00:40:09)?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I mean, I think, Manus, customer behavior has been exactly what you would have expected it to be so far during
the crisis, which both on the retail side and the corporate side a desire to retain liquidity at the moment, given all
of this uncertainty that exists. So, over the last year, we've built deposits by, I think it's 12% over $160 billion.
That's not a natural year-on-year growth on our deposit base and reflects very much, I think, customer behavior.
So, as people get more comfortable with the trajectory out of COVID-19, I think you'll begin to see that reverse.
Yeah. On the corporate side, we've already seen, relative to the first quarter when a lot of corporates drew down
substantially on secured lines they had with us, start to repay those lines. So, I think as both consumers and
corporates get more confidence back, you'll see those cash balances start reducing.

Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Aman Rakkar from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aman Rakkar Q
Analyst, Barclays Investment Bank
Morning, gents. Yeah, just a couple, please. Just coming back on NII. So, thanks very much for that comment
around consensus next year. I guess, just the kind of implied Q4 exit level probably suggests an annualized
number below $25 billion next year. So, to kind of get to where the Street is, it looks you're going to be looking to
the kind of 3%, 4% loan growth is probably my best estimate for now. Given that you're probably just going to be
deleveraging in the US and Europe, interested in what kind of growth you're targeting in terms of loan growth in
Asia to kind of deliver those numbers? I note that bounces were reasonably robust in Q3.
And I guess the second is on ECL. Can I just check? Is a round-up circa $1 billion charge the best guess of a kind
of underlying ECL for you guys in Q3? And if that's the case, does that potentially imply a number next year that's
perhaps closer to $4 billion than the $6 billion that consensus has in next year? I mean, [ph] does that number at
a fault (00:42:59) to you or is there just too much uncertainty for now? And I – yeah, actually, you know what, I'll
leave it there. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Okay. Well, firstly, on your NII math, we don't disagree with the math at an aggregate level, i.e., we do anticipate
that we – sort of low- to mid-single digit loan growth next year to sort of underpin the comments I made about
consensus and NII for next year, I would – the part of your commentary that Europe and the US is deleveraging, I
think, is only partly correct. I think a lot of the deleveraging that we saw happened in the second quarter. There is
the ongoing restructuring that we're doing in the rundown of the RWA books, not all of that is in lending assets,
and we're continuing. We do expect UK, Europe, US economies to recover in 2021. And we are seeing
consensus forecast for Asia, ex-Japan GDP forecast, thinking sitting above 5% for both 2021 and 2022. So, we
do think Asia growth, again, will outperform Western growth.
On ECLs, your consensus, I think, is sitting at about $6.1 billion for 2021. When we previously guided on loan loss
provisioning, pre-COVID through the cycle, we talked about 30 to 40 basis points. At 40 basis points, top end of
that, you get to just over $4 billion. That feels to me, intuitively, as we look at a bit low at the moment, equally $6
billion feels a bit high. So, it's sort of somewhere between those two numbers. But there was still significant
uncertainty out there around 2021. And I would also caveat my comments on ECLs generally around Brexit, I
think our comments about towards the lower end of the $8 billion to $13 billion range are very much premised on
a trade agreement happening. And if a trade agreement didn't happen, then I think we would have to adjust up
our ECL estimates. You could easily see $0.5 billion to $1 billion of additional ECLs in the fourth quarter, if in the
next few weeks we didn't have a trade agreement.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2020
Jason Napier Q
Analyst, UBS AG (London Branch)
Good morning. Thank you...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Hi, Jason.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Napier Q
Analyst, UBS AG (London Branch)
...for taking my questions. Hi, there. So, the first one on loan losses, I'm afraid, again. The performance of your
loan book has been, quite frankly, stellar if you look at the stage data with only 6% of retail loans in Stage 2 even
a little over 1% in Stage 3. I wondered, did you have any steps that you might be able to share on the extent of
any distortion in that that your customers are seeing as a consequence of the support that's around furlough
schemes and moratoria and so on, or is that really just conversational in nature and really that your book is this
strong at this stage of the downturn?
And then, the second question, and I appreciate this is an extraordinarily sensitive area, the Hong Kong
Autonomy Act, I wondered whether you could share what it is in your view that HSBC needs to do to avoid
sanction under that act that it appears that there's some leeway around significant transactions as regards to the
sanctioned individuals. What do you see as your responsibilities on that act, please? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Okay. Jason, thank you. I'll add a couple of comments on the quality of the loan book and hand to Ewen, if he
wants to add some comments. And then I'll pick up on the Hong Kong Autonomy Act. But firstly, the first thing
about the nature of the book is, inherently, particularly in our Consumer Banking business, we have a high-quality
secured book at the heart of what we do. So, we're primarily a secured book rather than an unsecured. Clearly,
we do some unsecured lending. But from proportionately, we have a much higher percentage of secured lending,
for example, here in the UK than the rest of the market. And that's why I think you see a particularly strong
performance in our retail book relative to other banks. That would also be true in Hong Kong.
What we've also seen some of the government schemes have unwound and payment holidays have unwound,
we are seeing a better performance on that unwind of government schemes than we had previously modeled or
expected. And people are reverting to normal payment patterns at a higher percentage than we had originally
modeled. So, they're just some general comments. Ewen, anything else?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I might just add a couple more things on that. In terms of some – we've obviously got a global portfolio of
government support schemes. And I think as we've seen some of them roll off particularly on the retail side, our
experience so far, Jason, has been, I would describe it as marginally better than what we had modeled. So, there
has been sort of encouraging signs that the credit assumptions that we've got are holding up.
And secondly, I think, that government support that we've seen, I think, for the corporate sector, has bought time
for the corporate sector to restructure it, bought time for the corporate sector to go out and raise debt and equity.
So, sitting here six months ago, we were far more concerned about downside tail risk than we would be today in
14

part because the government support has just allowed people time to restructure their businesses and be better
prepared.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
And on your second point, Jason, we're confident in our ability to navigate the increase in the complex regulatory
environment. And that we're committed to complying with the laws and regulations in every market we operate in.
We fully acknowledge that there is a level of complexity there today given the geopolitics, but we're confident of
our ability to navigate that situation. And I think, that's what I'd say to you in regards to the second part of the
question.

Edward Firth Q

Good morning, everybody.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Good morning, Edward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Firth Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Just two questions. Again, apologies, so it's back to net interest income. But I was sort of more interested really in
the sort of longer term outlook for net interest income rather than like this year, next year. And I guess, there're
two questions I had. One, if I look back to sensitivities you provided us in the past that sort of broadly, if you look
out five years, it's about double the one-year impact. Is that still the way we should think about it or are there
things that you can do or have done that can effectively mitigate that so that the bulk of any interest rate impact
we should see is sort of plus or minus 10 basis points, broadly in there? So, that would be my first question.
And then the second question is related to that. One of the big advantages of HSBC probably for the last 100
years has been on your loans to deposit ratio of around 70%, and I guess it's a bit lower now, but it has been a bit
15


HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2020 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2020
higher, but that's broadly where you stuck it. And I guess, in this environment, that means, what, 30% of your
deposits are either making you no money or actually loss-making?
Is there anything that you think that over a two-, three-, four-year plan that you can do to address that, or is that
something that – I mean, could we see that moving up to 80%, 90%, that sort of level? Or is your preference to
remain liquid likely to keep that roughly where it is? Sorry, that was a long question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Let me take the second part. The AD ratio, yes, at the moment is showing a significant surplus. At different points
in the economic cycle, that moves around. And if you were to go back a couple of years, you started to see quite
significant loan growth with slightly slower deposit growth. So, you started to see the AD ratio narrow to a degree.
As Ewen said earlier, we've had an influx of deposits as customers have borrowed less, spent less, and
accumulated cash.
So, you could expect over time that AD ratio to change, but I think we've always as a bank had a history of having
a strong liquidity position. So, I don't see us really operating at a 90% AD ratio in the future even in great times,
because we operate in markets around the world that are inherently more volatile and, therefore, we believe
strongly in having a strong liquidity position to manage through that volatility in difficult times. So, you get some
movement in the AD ratio going forward, but I don't think you're going to get us operating at a level of 90% on a
consistent basis or any point given the inherent nature of our book of business.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Firth Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So it's...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Ed, I think – your first question I think was around the NII sensitivity tables five years out. They do assume
a static balance sheet. They do assume no management action. So, I think you should assume that over a five-
year period, we would have some capacity to mitigate some of the risks that you see in net interest rate sensitivity
table.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
And just going back to that point on, Ed, if you were going to say but it depends how you look at that surplus and
is it earning money or not? You remember that high liquidity or low AD ratio is giving you access to an inherently
higher return market in Asia and the Middle East. So, you don't necessarily deploy all the liquidity to get every last
ounce of earnings out of it. But having that liquidity there allows you to access an inherently higher-return market,
Asia and Middle East, the emerging markets, that gives you a higher level of compensation for the amount of
lending that you're doing. So, you earn it in a different way than full deployment into low volatility, low return
markets, you're getting the earnings in a different way from HSBC.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Firth Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. So, it's not, like I said, a strategic priority for you to find assets to try and bulk up that balance sheet?

Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Hi, Tom.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tom Rayner Q
Analyst, Numis Securities Ltd.
Hi there. Good morning. Just wanted to ask back to the broad strategic questions, really, and you might sort of
pick me on and say wait until the full year. But in terms of what you've said today on the restructuring plan, you're
flagging additional cost savings. You're flagging additional RWA reduction. I'm just trying to think in terms of the
potential impact that that might have on future revenue growth and how important it is for you to be seen, for
HSBC to be seen as still having sort of growth potential, almost still being a bank that's in high-growth markets,
you want the market to view you as a potential growth stock. How does that sit with a focus on continuing to look
for the more cost savings and more RWA reductions? And obviously, that comment alluding to Household
International is quite interesting, but obviously you get too desperate for growth and you buy a bad asset, that's a
disaster. So, that was my first question.
And then, the second sort of strategic issue, again, from what you're saying, is all of the investment is being
pivoted now, by the sound of it, towards Asia. If this continues, I mean, is there a risk at some point the whole
question of domicile and where it makes most sense, for HSBC to be domiciled? Is that going to reemerge or is
that something that's been talked about, discussed, and decided on, and we're not going to be back there any
time soon? Thanks.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2020
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Let me – couple of comments on that. Let me, first of all, say I don't think pursuing a more efficient
organization necessarily means you cannot produce growth or pursue growth. I think the cost reduction we're
going for are good sensible cost reduction ambitions, reducing bureaucracy, simplifying processes, increasing
automation, improving customer experience. All of those things are supportive of our growth agenda as well. And
what we've clearly said in the statement that we are going to continue to invest in technology to further digitize the
bank. And out of that digitization will come a lower cost base, a better customer experience and growth
opportunities as you tap more market opportunities. So, I don't think they're incompatible. And certainly, we don't
want to be a growth-only transformation story. We must also be a growth story. And particularly with the footprint
that we have as an Asian bank and an international Asian bank, that would be part of our agenda.
And on domicile, we've said on many occasions, we're not revisiting the domicile decision. We believe there's a
power in being a global international bank with a strong focus on Asia, a strong focus on the Middle East, a strong
business in the UK. We're an international bank, bridging East and West and we're not revisiting the domicile
decision.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Now, on sort of going further on RWA reduction, Tom, I mean, you can see in the dispersion of returns in
our data pack that we've got a lot of capital that's not earning appropriate returns, earning well below cost of
capital returns. And I think you and everyone else on the call should welcome the fact that we're trying to
accelerate that and take more of those assets off our balance sheet, get more capital back as a result of that. And
if we can invest that in growth particularly in Asia, we're happy to invest it. And if we can't, we'll find a way of
returning it to shareholders.

Guy Stebbings Q

Good morning. I just want to come back, firstly, to capital and specifically try and size some of the headwinds
coming in the fourth quarter. And you called out the typical seasonal impact from the levy in global markets being
a bit lower plus the higher CTA to come. So, perhaps, earnings themselves might be a small headwind to capital.
18


HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2020 Earnings Call 27-Oct-2020
Plus, it looks like you're guiding to around about 30 basis points headwind from RWA movement. So, just taking
that into consideration, CET1 position could drop maybe towards 15%. But I think you previously guided to
software intangible benefit of around about 20 basis points. So, is it reasonable to think you should still be some
way above 15% before any possible dividend announcement alongside full-year results?
And then, the second question was just on CP14/20 and introduction of the Mortgage Store in the UK, which is
perhaps quite [ph] personal (01:00:37) for HSBC given your lower starting risk-weight density. Appreciate you
were already expecting the risk weights to move up given some of the other regulatory changes, and I think
you've guided to 7% or 8% previously. But given this further move, does it change your view at all on UK
mortgage book growth in the future? I guess, conversely, it could actually incentivize you to tilt the book to higher
margin, higher risk business over time. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So, look, we've previously guided I think to RWA growth for the full year of sort of mid-single digits. If you
look today, that would imply relatively material RWA growth in the final quarter. That looks to me, as I said today,
at the top end of the range of what we would expect, and you would have to see a degree of RWA migration that
is substantially higher than we've seen recently. So, we could well see a core Tier 1 ratio at the end of the year of
above 15%, I think.
On your comment on UK mortgages, even with those higher risk weights, we still think that we make sensible
economic returns on the mortgage lending we do in the UK. So, yes, it is a – the other thing I would say is that the
UK is one of those businesses that in the outer years of the plan would have been impacted by outward flows. So,
in some ways, this is just an acceleration of that impact of future capital buffers we would have had to build
anyway into the UK business.

Guy Stebbings Q

Joseph Dickerson Q

Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of quick ones, please. Just on the trajectory of getting down your targeted CET1
range, I guess how do you think about buybacks in that context, particularly in the near term, given the various
capital treatment of buybacks? And you've done buybacks before. So, any thoughts there would be helpful.
And then, as you seek to move towards more sustainable sources of non-interest income and deemphasize the
spot deposit spread businesses, I know you've mentioned that you're reviewing the US business, that obviously
the last review is already noted on this call happened when rates were higher. I guess, is everything on the table
as regards the US business, notably the retail business, which has, I believe off the top of my head, 50% or lower
loan-to-deposit ratio? Thanks.

Just around buyback.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. On buyback. As you've said, we're certainly not adverse to doing buybacks. I think you should have seen
what we want to do first is reestablish the dividend, set a sensible and sustainable dividend policy for 2021 and
beyond, and then, to the extent that there is excess capital on top of that, think about buybacks as part of that. I
would caution, though, that for 2021 in particular, there continues to be meaningful levels of uncertainty around
the economic outlook for 2021. So, don't expect us to try to seek to rapidly normalize our capital structure during
2021 until we see genuine sustained and concrete recovery in the global economy and we're through COVID-19
in a very meaningful way.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
And with respect to the US, I just want to reiterate, Michael and the team in the US, together with Greg and
George running Global Banking and Markets, have really made very strong progress in the first nine months of
this year. I reiterate RWA is well down, adjusted costs down, FTE is down 11%, branches reduced by 30%. So,
they've made great progress. But they're also very cognizant of the fact that the circumstances are more
challenging today than they were in February. And therefore, they're looking at ways to accelerate the road to
improve returns. But I won't go into any more detail on that at the moment. We'll do that with our Q4 results. But
I'm pleased with what they've achieved so far.
