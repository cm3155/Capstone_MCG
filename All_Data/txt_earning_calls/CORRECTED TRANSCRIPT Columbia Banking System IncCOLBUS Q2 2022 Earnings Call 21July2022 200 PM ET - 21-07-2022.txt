Thank you, Victor. Welcome and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call as we
review our second quarter results. The earnings release and accompanying investor presentation are available at
columbiabank.com.
Our associates continue to remain focused on delivering favorable outcomes for each of our stakeholders and
their efforts are reflected in our outstanding results for the second quarter. Net income of $58.8 million was the
best quarter in our 29-year history. Our solid operating fundamentals were propelled by exceptional loan growth
and underpinned by the strength of our stable core deposit base. We continue to see our investments in people
and systems payoff in terms of production capabilities. Our bankers are working hard every day to deepen and
expand relationships with our clients by providing products, solutions, and industry-specific expertise. These
activities support our clients' goals, which in turn supports the economic health of communities across our entire
footprint. Preparation for our combination with Umpqua Holdings is progressing as teams from both companies
eagerly await regulatory approval.

Thank you, Clint and good morning, everyone. Pre-tax pre-provision income rose by $11.2 million on a linked
quarter basis to $78.7 million. The increase was driven by a combination of rising interest income, higher non-
interest income, and lower operating expenses, most notably with declines in merger-related costs and
compensation and benefit costs, including the impact of some one-time items I will discuss in a moment. Total
deposits ended the quarter at $18 billion, which was a decrease of $342 million for the quarter, but up $2.6 billion
from a year earlier with $1.7 billion coming from our Merchants acquisition. The linked quarter decrease was
largely consistent with pre-pandemic seasonal trends. Our cost of deposits edged up 1 basis point to 5 basis
points.
Total loans rose by $563 million during the quarter to $11.3 billion. After factoring in PPP balances, loans
increased by [ph] $614 million (03:12) or 23% annualized. Growth was propelled by $734 million in new loan
originations and a 2.5 point increase in our loan utilization rate. Two years after the launch of the Paycheck
Protection Program, most of the $1.5 billion in loans we funded in communities throughout our footprint are now
forgiven and paid off by the SBA. As of June 30, only $32 million of PPP balances remain. Total investment
securities decreased $458 million during the quarter to $7.3 billion, which was 70% available for sale and 30%
held to maturity. The quarterly decrease was driven by both the fair value mark on our AFS portfolio, as well as
maturities, premium amortization and paydowns. No new purchases were made during the quarter. The expected
yield in the current portfolio is 1.89%, up 3 basis points during the quarter.
The net interest margin increased 4 basis points on a linked quarter basis to 3.16%, largely due to the shift in
earning assets and Fed funds into higher yielding loans. Excluding the 4 basis point differential of premium
amortization on acquired loans and securities and the 2 basis point differential in accelerated PPP fees between
the two quarters, the margin increased 10 basis points sequentially. New loans were brought on an average tax
adjusted coupon rate of 3.93%, which is up from 3.59% in the first quarter. And the coupon rate on the overall
portfolio, excluding PPP increased from 3.84% to 4.07%. More recent production is coming out at even higher
rates and with [ph] more loans lifting off (04:57) lower rates, we should see those benefits more fully reflected in
our third quarter results.
Non-interest income increased linked quarter by $826,000 to $25 million. Service charges and deposits – excuse
me – service charges and deposit accounts increased by $1.1 million largely due to $685,000 increase in sweep
account fees, which are reported on a gross basis with a similar offsetting amount recording to legal and
professional expense. Loan revenue increased by $688,000, mostly driven by an increase in our loan production
and prepayment penalties, but partly offset by the cyclical decline in mortgage banking revenue. Other non-
interest income declined by $821,000 largely because of one-time gains we recorded in the first quarter. For the
second quarter, we still had $1 million in non-recurring income, including a BOLI benefit and a payment for our
participation in an Oregon disaster relief program.
Non-interest expense decreased by $9.7 million linked quarter to $95.4 million. Adjusting for merger-related
expenses of $3.9 million in the second quarter and $7.1 million in the first quarter, non-interest expense
decreased by $6.5 million to $91.5 million. The linked quarter decrease was due to several factors, largely

affecting the compensation and benefits line. For one, the first quarter included roughly $2.1 million of seasonally
elevated payroll taxes and benefit costs. Meanwhile, the second quarter benefited by about $1.4 million from
benefit accrual and funding adjustments. And finally, the second quarter also benefited from FAS 91 capitalized
loan origination costs owing to the very strong loan production in the period and that reduced compensation
expense by about $1 million compared to the first quarter and about $0.5 million compared to the average over
recent periods.
Finally, occupancy and data processing costs also declined, some of which stemmed from the completion of our
Merchants Bank core conversion back in March. We anticipate our normalized expense run rate, excluding
merger costs, to be in the mid-90s.
The provision for income taxes increased $565,000 on a linked quarter basis to $16.2 million, representing a
21.6% effective rate. We continue to expect our 2022 tax rate to be in the 20% to 22% range, but perhaps toward
the higher end of that range given our higher profitability. Lastly, as I discussed last quarter, the rising interest
rates resulted in a negative fair value mark on our investment portfolio reflected through accumulated other
comprehensive income. While this mark does not affect our regulatory capital ratios, it does weigh on our tangible
common equity ratio and tangible book value. Excluding ASCI, however, both our TCE ratio and our tangible book
value increased during the quarter.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris.

Thank you, Aaron. Our forward momentum is accelerating as we exit the pandemic and in anticipation of
upcoming combination with Umpqua Holdings. In a very competitive market, Columbia's bankers are continuing to
take care of existing clients while simultaneously finding and driving new business. As mentioned earlier in the
call, loan growth was outstanding. Ex-PPP loan production of $734 million was another record, shattering the old
record of $640 million set just two quarters ago. About 25% of the growth in the loan portfolio was due to increase
in line utilization, primarily in the agricultural and finance sectors with the remaining growth driven by record
production predominantly in real estate leasing, healthcare, agriculture and construction sectors.
New production was sourced 51% from Washington, 24% from Oregon, 10% from California, 6% from Idaho, and
the remaining 9% from outside of our footprint to our specialty, tribal, and national healthcare teams.
Approximately $186 million of the new balances was from clients with commitments of greater than $10 million.
Notwithstanding the strong production during the quarter, our pipelines continued to expand and remain to our
satisfaction. The quarterly production mix was 75% fixed, 22% floating, and 3% variable.
Term loans represented $525 million of total new production, while lines accounted for $209 million. The overall
portfolio mix is now 55% fixed, 31% floating, and 14% variable. Over the past 12 months, we have seen a shift
from C&I towards CRE loans, which now makes up 46.4% of the portfolio, up from 42.3% one year ago. This shift
can be partly attributed to the payoff of $660 million of net PPP loans during the year. As a result of higher rates,
we continue to see a decline in our mortgage warehouse business during the quarter with sold loans dropping
from $57 million to $39 million, which compares to $101 million in the second quarter of 2021. Overall, the
composition of the loan portfolio did not change materially, even with the increase in line utilization.
Deposits declined $342 million during the second quarter, which is normal due to seasonal business activity. The
mix remained consistent at 49% non-interest bearing and 51% interest bearing. The composition also remained

consistent with 60% commercial and 40% retail. If seasonal patterns hold, deposit balances will pick up in the
third quarter through the remainder of the year.
Earlier this month, we announced the expansion of our footprint into Utah, adding a highly experienced
commercial lending team in the Salt Lake City market. In addition, we continue to invest in our retail network with
our newest financial hub opening next week in a vibrant, attractive district of Tacoma. Financial hubs are full
service locations that are uniquely focused on helping our clients achieve their comprehensive financial goals,
including investments, trust services, and other financial considerations.
Both producers and clients across our footprint see the value of the upcoming combination with Umpqua and the
increased capabilities that it will bring. Our bankers are doing a great job remaining outwardly focused, expanding
our customer base while generating high-quality loans and long-term deposit relationships during a time when
many companies would be internally focused.
Now, I will turn the call over to Andy to review our credit performance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew L. McDonald
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thanks, Chris. For the quarter, we had a $2.1 million to our allowance. The additional reserve was primarily
driven by loan growth during the quarter and a less favorable economic forecast. Last quarter, the unemployment
rate was expected to end 2022 at 3.4% and remain at or below pre-pandemic levels throughout the forecast
period. The current forecast assumes the unemployment rate will end 2022 at 3.7% and remain above pre-
pandemic levels throughout the forecast period. Last quarter, the full year GDP growth expectations for 2022 was
3.3%. The current forecast assumes full year GDP growth expectations for 2022 of 2.5% and assumes GDP will
remain below 2% throughout the forecast period. Offsetting loan growth and the less favorable economic forecast
was a continuation in the trend of improving credit metrics and to a lesser extent net recoveries of about
$886,000.
As I mentioned a moment ago, our credit trends continue to move in a positive direction, albeit at a more modest
pace. Non-performing loans remain low at only 15 basis points of period in loans, and substandard loans declined
$76 million during the quarter and now represent less than 2.5% of total loans. Special mentioned loans are less
than 1% of total loans. For the year, problem loans those rated watch or worse have declined $127 million. The
bank's impaired asset ratio has also declined from 21.6% to 14.5%. Given these metrics, our allowance going
forward will continue to be driven primarily by loan growth and the economic forecasts.
In summary, while we are seeing credit quality metrics similar to that, which we enjoyed pre-pandemic, we remain
cognizant of the current global environment and instability in Europe, rising interest rates, especially their impact
on housing and inflationary pressures here at home. So, while we are optimistic for the future performance of the
portfolio near term, we remain cautious as we look further down the road.
Okay, back to you, Clint.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: All right. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Feaster from
Raymond James. Your line is open.

David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey, good morning, everybody.

Good morning, David.

David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Maybe just starting on deposits, obviously you guys have a phenomenal low-cost core deposit franchise. But I'm
just curious maybe if you could walk through some of the underlying trends that you're seeing, especially since
quarter end – where it sounds like in the market that we're hearing more conversations about exception pricing in
those types of things in migration within books. Just curious whether there's any interesting trends you've seen
within your book and what drove the runoff. Is it more munis or anything like that? And then just any other trends
worth highlighting and whether you'd expect more outflows potentially for the remainder of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
So, you've got Chris and Aaron fighting across the table to decide who gets to answer this first. So, I'm going to
jump in and just steal their thunder. And what we saw the second quarter really was started to feel a lot like our
seasonal patterns that we've had pre-pandemic. And I think it was in Chris' comments that he mentioned that
those traditional patterns hold true in the third quarter and for the balance of the year that we should see some
deposit growth come back in. And I'd say that so far at this point in the third quarter, we are seeing those historical
seasonal patterns of deposit growth. And on a overall basis, we weren't down materially in the second quarter.
We move around $150 million, $200 million from day to day. So, sometimes it's just a matter of that focal date of
June 30 and somebody laid a big deposit on us or system cash out.
So, I'll step back now and let Chris and Aaron continue their argument over who's going to fill in the details.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hey, David, this is Chris. I'll provide a little color to the outflows. As we've always talked, we've talked about
controlling our deposit costs through using wealth management, CB Financial. And during the quarter, of that
number, about $55 million was the net movement to CB Financial to take advantage of some higher rate
opportunities. The exception pricing, we still continue to utilize that. It's trending kind of is the normal, maybe a
little bit more with what's going on in the market. But overall, the base of our deposit funding is very consistent to
where it was. We'll continue to see what happens with the competition and things of that nature. But we're really
following the playbook that we've always had and it's – as of today it's continuing to bear out.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just – look, it's extremely impressive to see record origination in production.
And if I heard correctly that you're continuing to see expanding pipelines like that combination is really impressive.
I'm just curious what do you think is allowing you to be so successful. I mean, is it the economic recovery? Is it
some of your new hires? Is it people excited about the deal? I'm just curious, as you step back and look at it, what
do you think is allowing you to be so successful? And is this kind of continued pace of growth sustainable,
especially as we look at higher rates and potential deceleration in originations, but you also got the prospects of
slower payoffs and paydowns, just any high level thoughts?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
So, I think it really starts with a conscious decision that we made in the second quarter of 2020. While a lot of our
competitors shuttered their operations, scattered their teams, and tried to run their banks from the basement of
their vacation homes, we were here every day. And we continue just serving the needs of our communities and
taking care of our clients. And a lot of the business that we've won over the last couple of years, our prospects
that we've called on for in some cases 10 plus years and they just didn't really like the experience or the lack of
availability of their existing bank and/or their existing bank pulled out of certain markets. And so, I think that, that
that momentum that we didn't lose the momentum that a lot of I think end market competitors lost. And so they've
been trying to regain some momentum. We've just continued to accelerate. And I think that approach has also
helped us to attract great talent with some of the hires that we've talked about and some – many that we haven't.
We continue to attract a lot of great bankers across the footprint.
And the announcement on our Utah team is just the most recent example of that type of activity. And so, I think
it's not something where we just flipped the switch and we had a lot of momentum actually going into 2020.
Coming out of 2019 we were starting off the first quarter, it was shaping up to be a tremendous first quarter of
2020. And then, of course, the pandemic hit and everything kind of came to a standstill. So, I don't know if that
gives you everything you want or if Chris wants to add some additional context or not. But that's really I think it's
not something that it's just started. It's something that we've been very focused on for a few years now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. [audio gap] (00:21:56) I'd add on the aspect of just backing up the – our bankers are out and about. They're
very proactive and staying focused. As you look towards the pending combination, the Integration Management
Office is doing a fantastic job so that our bankers can focus on all the stuff that they do externally. And then that
team continues to work internally on all of the stuff that happens on day one. As far as when you look at how it
kind of all came together specifically to production, there's certainly been some pent-up demand that came
through. I think the second quarter you saw a little bit of and some things that came through some taking
advantage of the lower rates before things started to rise. That certainly helped with it as well. We were able to
take advantage of those, get into some new deals while retaining a lot of our own business as well.
I think your question about is it sustainable? That's certainly one of the unknown questions and which we've
talked before, I hesitate to speculate that we'll set record after record. But I'm very comfortable with what our
teams are doing. And I think there's going to be a natural summer pullback as well and we'll see how it plays out
for the rest of the year.

But it's truly – it truly was incredible.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
That's – yeah, that's great. And maybe just touching on asset quality and giving Andy a little airtime. You guys
always maintain a conservative approach to credit. And we've seen continued improvement in asset quality and
you guys talked about it. There's some real challenges in the economy. I'm just curious at a high level your
thoughts on the credit outlook from your all standpoint and in the pulse of the clients – as you look out, are there
any segments that you're maybe a bit more cautious on? Are there any segments where you're maybe seeing
clients pull back or that you're avoiding? And then on the other side, I mean, what is your appetite for credit at this
point? And have you guys begun tightening standards?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew L. McDonald A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well, first of all our appetite remains consistent through all of the cycles. And I think that that for our customers
and for our prospects makes us I think predictable and they like that. So, we're not in and out of segments and we
don't adjust our underwriting criteria to get more loans or get less and stuff like that. We try to be very consistent
throughout the entire cycle. So, our risk appetite remains the same.
Overall, yeah, credit is looking really good. I hate to say it's probably as good as it's going to get, but I guess I just
said it. And so, really the economy will be a big driver of how we move forward. The segments that are under
stress, I mean, we continue to be concerned with hospitality a little bit, but I think we've got our arms around that
and most of that I think is pretty well taken care of. But it remains for certain kinds of – especially if it's business
travel related that remains a challenge versus vacation.
Elderly care, yeah, the pandemic theoretically is over, but not in assisted living and nursing care facility because it
only takes a small outbreak and then they get – they can't take in new people. There's still a reluctance for a lot of
people to place their mother or their father into those facilities. And they're designed in such a way that they need
relatively high occupancy to cover the fixed costs of running the facility. So, elderly cares there, we don't have a
big bucket of elderly care, but it's less than $100 million for us. But almost all of it is exhibiting some kind of stress.
I think on a broader case – I'm not going to tell you anything you don't already know. But a lot of businesses are
still struggling to find employees. And in the restaurant area, they're open, but they can't run at full capacity
because they don't have enough servers. And so, that impacts their ability to generate revenue. Grocery stores
are closing delis, which happened to me the other day because they don't have enough people to staff the deli.
So, a lot of businesses are really struggling. And inflation so far is running ahead of wages. So, real nominal
consumer spending hasn't really increased. But I do and I think have some concerns over continued wage
inflation and really begin to exceed the commodity side of inflation if you will. So, that's probably the longer term
the concern in the portfolio.

line of Matthew Clark from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Maybe just to close the loop on credit. Andy, I don't think you mentioned office, but that seems to be another kind
of longer term concern for [audio gap] (00:28:07). We've heard property values in certain metro market that I don't
think you really dabble in that much – values there could be 25%. Are you seeing anything like that in any of your
markets? I know I'm sure a lot of what you have is suburban office, but any color around the office would be great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew L. McDonald A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Certainly, the downtown core of Seattle and Portland are the weakest office markets, but those buildings
are way bigger than what we ever get involved in. But it does impact the region a bit. And you are correct. We're
primarily in the suburban and rural markets. Most of our office is actually walk-up two, three story, 2x4
construction, you've got the veterinary clinic, the dentist, maybe an architect, and a law firm in it. So, our office
composition is not sort of what you would be reading about in The Wall Street Journal.

Got it. Okay.

Andrew L. McDonald A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
[indiscernible] (29:22) – I don't know where large buildings in Seattle are trading because that's not the market we
play in. But I would say that in general cap rates remain extremely low because there's so much money looking
for a home. And so, while we aren't seeing the same inflationary pressures in real estate values they are holding,
but they're just not increasing. So, we'll have to wait and see as rates continue to rise by the Fed. If cap rates rise,
9

then you'll see values. But right now, there's a lot of money looking for homes in just about every segment of the
real estate market.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. And then shifting gears to the margin. Aaron, [Technical Difficulty] (30:14) have the margin, the
average margin in the month of June. And as a follow-up, but – what the spot rate was on at the end of June and
the weighted average rate on new loans going into 3Q?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
The – so, we did see margin improvement through the quarter. The new coupon on loans in June was [ph] 4.17%
(30:45), that compares obviously favorably to the average for the quarter. So, we're seeing good directional lift
there. And I think our – you asked about the margin – the margin overall for June was – on an operating basis
was [ph] 3.24% (31:08). That was up about I think from [ph] 3.09% (31:12) in the March – month of March. So,
again, good directional trends there. But one of the things that I want to point out because I think it's an important
point and we've talked about this in the past where there's with the inflection of margin trends we always said it
was going to take a little bit of time before we really saw that pull-through. And a big part of that stems from the
floors that we have on our loans. And we've got some pretty good breakout on slide 10 of our investor deck that
we kind of show this.
And if you look back to the March quarter, we had about $1.7 billion of loans that were still subject to floors. And
moving forward to June 30, that number dropped to about $1.2 billion and most of that would need just a 25 basis
point change in the Fed funds to lift off floors. And obviously with next week's anticipated FOMC meeting, we're
going to get something well above that. So, with that, we will have over $3.5 billion of loans that will be adjustable
with rate resets that should be come in pretty short order. So, we should start to see a much better impact from
the rate hikes coming forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. Okay. And then I don't know if you mentioned it during your prepared remarks. Any guidance for the
upcoming quarter on a standalone basis from a non-interest expense perspective assuming production flows –
capitalized, deferred – FAS91, I would assume those would increase, but any guide around that run rate?

prior deals where the process has to run its course. But we're not – we're not wasting any time to the extent that
we can continue to prepare ourselves for when we do receive approval and move quickly towards closing. There's
not anything that jumps out that – from my perspective that creates any type of an anomaly or makes the approval
process more challenging or difficult. I don't know if that, that helps you or not. But it's just we're just going through
the normal process.
I don't know the answer specifically on if our deal is in line behind the US Bank deal. I think we announced about
roughly 30 days or so after they did. So, I know the DOJ is very busy, but I don't have visibility into everything in
terms of what they're actually working on at any given point in time. But I do know that our application is being
worked on. And while it's – the delay is a little bit frustrating, the real value that we feel that this combination
creates for all of our stakeholders is a long-term decision. And so, if it's a matter of a few months here on the front
end, it doesn't change our excitement or expectation for the benefits of this combination to all of our stakeholders.

Okay. Great. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of J. Rulis
from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple of questions on maybe production. Chris, could you tell us the pipeline as
we sit today versus where you sat at the same point in the second quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
It's very similar to what was going in the second quarter. I won't give an absolute figure on that, but, yeah, it's very
similar.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
And Chris, is there – this is pretty specific. But thinking about the Utah expansion and those individuals, is there
any kind of non-compete there? Do you think that their book of business can hit beginning in the third quarter?
Any timing there or could we assume we could see some positive impact from that group immediately?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. They've been on for about a month now and so couple weeks in total. And when you look at it, there's
always or typically there could be a non-solicit or anything of that nature. We're not really – we don't build these
teams in expansions on what necessarily can come from their existing book. It's really more about what's the go-
forward, how active are they in the market, and how quickly can they seize on new opportunities. The books, they
tend to be fairly – well, especially in a rising rate environment they tend to – it's really hard to pull somebody when

you go in and offer them a higher rate today than what they had where they're currently at. So, that'll take a little
bit more time.
We're really comfortable with these teams that they are the external sourcing types of bankers that we typically
attract and bring on board. So, from that standpoint, the team that started with us earlier in January, they certainly
hit the ground running into the second quarter, so 90-ish days. I do know there are some opportunities that we are
working on currently and they're already in there and so, yeah, I would expect that you start seeing something
new to the maybe not in the third quarter here, but certainly moving into the fourth quarter.

Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. Thank you. And Aaron, appreciate kind of some of the touch points you gave on margin throughout the
quarter. A specific question to sort of cash and equivalent balances. As those were worked down, was that pretty
steady through the quarter? Was it early part or late? Anything on timing of how those balances moved?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
No. I mean, there was a little bit of variability around this – you could tell like in April when you had a lot of tax
payments going out and things like that, there was some bigger variances. But now I would say in terms of how
that loan is – those funds were used for loan funding it was a pretty steady flow through the core.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay and may be a last one perhaps for Clint. Just – I believe kind of organizational charts have been shared
Umpqua and COLB. I guess is – is the next sort of point of stress if you think about the combined employee base,
would that be a closing a conversion or is there anything more internal that as you work through as you said
you're not sitting idly by you're preparing? I'm just thinking more of the personnel that could be – pressure points
of when companies are come together, anything like between now and close or conversion that would also come
up in that timeline.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I think just the length of time that we're in right now, this period that we're in waiting on regulatory approval
– that weighs on some folks. I mean, part of the bringing the companies together, we have in both organizations
today leaders and individuals that want to retire. And through a normal course of business when somebody
retires, they can pick a date, you have a big party, they plan a trip, and they leave town for a month. Well, we
don't know if that's exactly when to have that party for them. And so, I've seen that there's a few individuals here
in our corporate headquarters that are in that situation. And so, that creates I guess a point of frustration for them.
I think that we're still running two separate companies and we're planning for what we are when we come
together. So, in essence it's like you've got two jobs. You're doing your job today at Columbia Bank or at Umpqua
Bank, but then you're also thinking towards the future. And so, I think that that once we get to the close, some of
that pressure gets released from the organization. There are situations where there is one job for two people. And
to your earlier comment about org charts and things, those have been communicated. And so, that's the other
piece of where depending on at what point in the process if it's at the close, if it's 30 days post-close, if it's 90 days
post-conversion – and those that are centered around the conversion, now they still have some pretty good
12

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
certainty around the timing of what that looks like. But those that are centered or based on the actual closing of
the merger, they don't really – they don't really know exactly when that date will be.
So, I think that I guess those are kind of the different scenarios that I think about. But all in all, across both
organizations, there's still tremendous amount of excitement, the opportunity that this creates for all of our
stakeholders, our clients. I've been doing a lot of client visits in the last couple of months. And some of them,
they're surprised to find out that the merger hasn't closed and they're excited to have greater access to our
bankers, greater availability of products and services. So, I don't want to take your question and just focus on the
pressure points of the organization. I think that the excitement still far outweighs anything in terms of just the
normal course of merger type integration work.

Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Yeah. Appreciate it, Clint. That just – it wasn't a negatively pointed, just to kind of walk through the process. So,
that's helpful and appreciate the feedback. Thanks.
