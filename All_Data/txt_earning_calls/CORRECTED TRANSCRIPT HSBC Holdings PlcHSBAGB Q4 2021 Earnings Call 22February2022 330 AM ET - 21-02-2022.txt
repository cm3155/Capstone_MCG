MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Noel Quinn
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Good morning in London. It's great to see everybody in the room with us today. Thank you for coming. And good
afternoon to everyone watching and listening in Hong Kong and elsewhere.
Ewen will take you through our Q4 numbers very shortly, but I'd like to begin with a summary of how we delivered
against our strategic plan in 2021. As you know, we refreshed our core purpose as an organization a year ago.
Opening up a world of opportunity draws heavily on HSBC's past, but it also encapsulates what we need to focus
on to succeed now and in the future. By keeping our purpose and the values that underpin it firmly in mind, we
delivered good progress against our four strategic pillars: focus on our strengths, digitize at scale, energize for
growth, and transition to net zero. And this has contributed to a strong financial performance, which was
supported by the global economic recovery.
Starting now with a few highlights. I'm pleased with the progress we've made on both our transformation and
growth agendas, and I want to pay tribute to the whole HSBC team for the job they've done in 2021. The
underlying growth in key revenue streams came through strongly in Q4 to offset the drag effect of declining rates
resulting in a reported revenue growth of 2% in the quarter. Coupled with tailwinds from higher interest rates, this
provides strong revenue momentum for the future.
We're also well on our way through a number of announced exits and acquisitions that materially alter our capital
allocation to areas where we have a distinctive competitive advantage. Reported profits before tax for the full year

were up 115% to $18.9 billion. All regions were profitable. Asia led the way with $12.2 billion of reported profits,
including $1.1 billion from India, up $90 million on the year. There was also strong contributions of $2.2 billion of
adjusted profits from our non-ring-fenced bank operations in the UK and Europe, and $900 million of adjusted
profits from the US business. I was also pleased there was strong fee income growth across all businesses with
overall – which, overall, was above pre-COVID levels. Plus, international accounts opening in Commercial
Banking was up 13% and trade balances were up 23% overall and today stand higher than pre-COVID levels.
We increased spending on technology and performance-related pay, but I'm pleased we kept costs stable, able to
do so due to the savings from our transformation programs which are ahead of plan. If rates follow the path
currently implied by the market, we now expect to reach at least 10% RoTE in 2023. That's a year earlier than we
had previously signaled.
We took a charge on expected credit losses in Q4 primarily due to change in market conditions in the Mainland
China commercial real estate sector. Ewen will go into this in more detail, but I'm pleased to say we have seen
some positive movements in market sentiments since the year-end. Finally, we've announced full-year dividends
of $0.25 per share, up 67%, as well as our intention to initiate an incremental share buyback of up to $1 billion on
top of the existing buyback of up to $2 billion announced earlier in the year.
This slide sets out how this translates into progress against our ambitions. It shows good progress in key areas.
Revenue growth for the year as a whole was impacted by the low interest rate environment, particularly in Asia
where we experienced lower HIBOR rates in 2021. But we turned the corner in Q4 as net interest income grew
year-on-year for the first time since the pandemic began, and all our global businesses grew fee income in 2021
by high-single-digits.
Costs were down slightly year-on-year and we expect 2022 adjusted costs to be stable on that position. RoTE
was 8.3%. Our capital ratio remained strong at 15.8%, and we expect to move into our CET1 target range of 14%
to 14.5% in 2022. And we've made over $104 billion of RWA saves across the group over the last two years
against our original three-year target of $110 billion. Given this progress, we now expect to achieve $120 billion of
cumulative RWA saves by the end of this year.
The next slides go through key metrics on our four strategic pillars. The first pillar is focused on our strengths,
which is about capitalizing on the unique advantages we have as an institution. Wealth and Personal Banking is
one of those areas, particularly in Asia. Our investment in people, technology and capabilities yielded strong
returns. We had a strong year in net new invested assets especially in Asia, greatly helped by a strong flow of
referrals from our wholesale banking clients. This is an inherent strategic advantage that we are investing in.
Overall, wealth balances grew to $1.7 trillion. And within that, funds under management increased by 5%
supported by more than 30 new asset management products in Asia. Asia wealth revenue also grew by 10%,
mainly due to the improvement in equity markets and customer sentiment, while we also saw strong mortgage
growth in Hong Kong and the UK.
Finally, on this slide, I was pleased that the value of new insurance business in Asia in Q4 was higher than the
same period in both 2019 and 2018. This is the cumulative effect of a significant investment program and
turnaround in that business over the last three to four years. It is also particularly encouraging given the border
between Hong Kong and Mainland China remains closed.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 22-Feb-2022
Slide 5 focuses on Wholesale Banking. We saw strong fee income growth across our wholesale franchises even
as we exited clients and shrunk our capital base in Global Banking and Markets. This offset lower trading income
when compared to the exceptionally strong performance we saw in 2020.
International connectivity remains key to our strategy. As I said earlier, trade balances were up 23% overall and
above pre-COVID levels. GLCM balances were up $54 billion or 8% year-on-year to over $750 billion. And
collaboration revenues were also up 8%, with referrals between Commercial Banking and Global Banking and
Markets up 12%. I've been pleased with the way that Global Banking and Markets has performed for the past two
years, even while we've been repositioning that business. Adjusted RWAs were down 10% as we continue to
transfer resources mainly from Europe into Asia and the Middle East.
Slide 6 shows how we've exited nonstrategic businesses in the West, while accelerating customer acquisition in
the East. I'm pleased by the progress we've made in transforming the US and Continental Europe business, but
also by their good profit performance in 2021. The transactions for the sale of the US retail business have closed
on schedule in the last two weeks. Meanwhile, we expect to close the sale of our French retail business in the
second half of 2023.
We also accelerated the development of our Asia wealth capabilities through the acquisition of AXA Singapore
which was completed earlier this month on schedule, the acquisition of L&T Investment Management in India
which we hope to complete towards the end of this year, and regulatory approval to take full ownership of our
HSBC Life joint venture in China, all on top of the organic build-out of our Pinnacle business in Mainland China
which continues ahead of schedule.
Slide 7 looks at our second pillar, digitize at scale, which is about making it easier for our customers to bank with
us and making our processes more efficient. We've continued to invest heavily in technology while managing
costs, spending around $6 billion in 2021 which is equivalent to around 19% of our adjusted operating expenses
which was up 1 percentage point on the prior year. Our ambition is to keep the increasing technology spending to
more than 21% of our operating expenses by 2025. This investment provides us with significant operating
leverage as we grow the business in the future.
It is also enabling us to deploy solutions at scale globally and to further leverage agile work here and cloud
technology. While our usage of both agile and cloud increased in 2021, we have ambitions to drive further growth
in the years to come. Digital penetration levels have also increased with today, 84% of trade transactions globally
initiated through digital channels, a 58% increase in the share of digital payments made through HSBCnet mobile
app by wholesale customers, and 43% of retail customers are now mobile active. Although this figure was up 5
percentage points on the prior year, I still see a significant opportunity to grow it much further.
Our third strategic pillar is about creating a dynamic, inclusive culture where people want to work and they feel
empowered. In our most recent staff survey, our employee engagement score was 72%, unchanged on 2020;
more encouragingly, 5 percentage points up on 2019 and 4 percentage points above the financial services
benchmark. We're aiming to build a more diverse business. We were pleased to exceed our target of 30% of
women in leadership roles globally in 2020, and we set ourselves a new target of 35% by 2025. We've also made
progress on ethnicity representation especially for black colleagues, but we still have a way to go to get to where
we want to be and need to be on both of these measures.
And we're helping our colleagues to develop future-ready skills. Over 115,000 colleagues use the new Degreed
learning platform last year, with the average time spent on training for full-time employee up 16% despite the
pressures of COVID. An increasing share of this time was spent on areas like digital, data and sustainability, all of
4

which are essential for our future. I also want to add that another important part of our culture is that we remain
cost-conscious. I am absolutely determined we won't go back to the days when the rise in the interest rates
loosened our grip on costs.
Slide 9 looks at the transition plan to net zero, our fourth pillar. Our ambition is to provide and facilitate between
$750 billion and $1 trillion of sustainable financing and investment by 2030. I truly believe this will enable us to
play a leading role in the transition, and we've made a very strong start. Since the beginning of 2020, we've
provided and facilitated $127 billion of sustainable financing and investment to our clients. We are committed to
working with our clients to develop valid, science-based transition plans to understand sector by sector, client by
client how we move to net zero by 2050. These transition plans and the targets within them must be predicated on
the science relevant to the individual sectors. We will use them as a basis for further engagement and decision-
making, including how we drive change within our portfolio constructs.
As a part of this process, we have today disclosed interim targets for on-balance sheet financed emissions in the
oil and gas and power and utility sectors. In the year ahead, we plan to set interim targets for financed emissions
across a range of other sectors. And we will work on our climate transition plan, which will be published in 2023
and will bring together in one place how we embed our net zero targets into our strategy, our processes, our
policies, and our governance, informed by bottom-up transition plans.
I'm pleased by the progress we've made reducing greenhouse gas emissions from our own operations. Our
combination of less travel and sustainable energy deals enable us to halve our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions
compared to 2019. As the world normalizes, we have to be clear that we do not expect our route to net zero to be
linear. But we do believe that many of these changes are embedded for future years. Overall, there's more to do,
but I'm pleased with the progress we've made so far.
I'll now hand over to Ewen for the Q4 numbers.

Thanks, Noel. Good morning or afternoon, all, and echo Noel, great to see so many of you in the room today with
us.
We had another good quarter of reported pre-tax profits of $2.7 billion, up 92% on last year's fourth quarter.
Adjusted revenues were modestly up on last year's fourth quarter. This reinforces what I said at the third quarter,
we think we're now past the trough in revenues. ECLs were $450 million net charge in the quarter. Operating
expenses were down $800 million on last year's fourth quarter due to a lower bank levy and continuing good cost
discipline. Our return on tangible equity for 2021 was 8.3%. Our core Tier 1 ratio remained strong at 15.8%.
Tangible net asset value per share of $7.88 was up $0.07 on the third quarter.
We've announced full-year 2021 dividends of $0.25 per share. That's up 67% on the prior year. We also intend to
initiate an incremental buyback of up to $1 billion. This will begin after the buyback of up to $2 billion is concluded
in April.
Turning to slide 11. As I headline, we're pleased with the lending and fee income growth that we're now seeing.
Lending balances were up 1% overall on the third quarter. Underlying, this was 5% growth for our Personal and
Commercial Banking businesses combined equivalent to $38 billion in total, which was partially offset by planned
reductions in Global Banking and Markets.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 22-Feb-2022
There was strong lending growth in Wealth and Personal Banking, up $27 billion or 6% on the fourth quarter of
last year, reflecting another strong mortgage performance in the UK and Hong Kong. Lending was up $11 billion
in Commercial Banking, mainly in trade and term lending in Asia.
Fee income increased by 5% versus the fourth quarter of 2020. Within this, Commercial Banking increased fee
income by 15%, reflecting both good volume growth and repositioning in some areas towards fee income.
On the next slide, despite the impact of lower rates, we've been seeing a recovery in revenues for the Commercial
Banking for a few quarters now and has continued in the fourth quarter. Global Banking and Markets had another
good quarter, driven primarily by good performance in FX and Capital Markets and Advisory. And we saw our first
quarter of year-on-year revenue growth in Personal Banking since the onset of COVID-19. And in Wealth, strong
new business growth was offset by adverse insurance market impacts.
Tonight, for the current quarter, we expect some weakness in our Asian Wealth revenues. As highlighted
previously, our revenues will be impacted by the adoption of IFRS 17 in 2023. We continue to expect an initial
downward adjustment to our insurance profits of around two-thirds. As we said at the third quarter, we are
planning for an around $3 billion adjustment to our insurance's tangible equity, and we intend to provide further
detail on IFRS 17 in the third quarter of this year.
On slide 13, net interest income was $6.8 billion, up 3% against the third quarter on a reported basis. This was
mainly driven by higher yields on customer loans as well as underlying asset growth. On rates, the net interest
margin was 119 basis points, unchanged on the third quarter, with higher asset yields offset by changes in the
asset mix. Based on the current interest rate expectations for 2022, we expect net interest income to now grow
materially with further material growth in 2023. We think we've given you the building blocks to model this,
including modeling the sensitivity as rate curve shift.
Turning to slide 14 and recognizing the higher gearing we have to a better rate environment. I wanted to say a
few words and I disclosed interest rate sensitivity analysis. As a reminder, our high interest rate sensitivity is
driven by our balance sheet structure, namely a deposit surplus of around $700 billion and the short tenure of our
lending portfolios and trade franchise.
For illustration purposes, our tables now assume a simplified pass-through rate for all interest-bearing deposits. In
reality, for the first few rate rises, we assume we'll see a lower pass-through rate rising towards or above 50% of
rates continue to rise.
On the next slide, we reported a net charge of $450 million of ECLs in the quarter. This included Stage 2 charges
primarily relating to commercial real estate in Mainland China, a substantial part of which is booked in Hong Kong.
As Noel says, there has been some positive sentiment since the year-end. We expect this to begin to help ease
the current tight liquidity for the sector.
Stage 3 charges remained low and the quarter also included COVID-19 related releases. We're continuing to hold
around $600 million of COVID-19 uplift to Stage 1 and 2 ECL reserves, equivalent to about 15% of the initial
reserve.
The overall quality of our loan book remains good. Stage 3 loans, as a percentage of total loans, are stable at
around 1.8%. We expect ECLs to normalize towards 30 basis points of average loans in 2022 with upside from
potential COVID-19 releases in the first half of 2022 and potential risk from continued uncertainty in Mainland
China commercial real estate.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 22-Feb-2022
Turning to slide 16, the fourth quarter adjusted operating costs, excluding the bank levy, were modestly down on
the same period last year. 2021 costs were broadly stable on 2020 as per our third quarter guidance. The fourth
quarter performance was driven by continued good cost control, together with a lower performance-related pay
accrual in the quarter relative to the fourth quarter last year.
The bank levy came in at $116 million. This was lower than expected due to an offset in credit for bank levy fees
paid in prior years. We expect the bank levy to normalize at around $300 million per year from this year onwards.
We made a further $600 million of cost program savings during the fourth quarter with an associated cost to
achieve of around $600 million.
Turning to the next slide, in the first two years of our three-year cost program, we've achieved savings of $3.3
billion with cumulative cost to achieve spend to-date of $3.6 billion. We now expect to exceed our overall target of
$5 billion to $5.5 billion of cost savings with at least a further $2 billion of cost savings in 2022 and at least a
further $500 million of savings in 2023. We expect to fully utilize our $7 billion cost to achieve budget by the end
of 2022. So, please model a final cost to achieve spend of $3.4 billion this year. Despite inflationary pressures,
Noel and I are committed to continuing to deliver tight cost control.
For 2022, we aim to keep adjusted costs, again, broadly stable. And in 2023, we intend to manage adjusted cost
growth to be within a 0% to 2% range.
A few things to note for 2023 costs and beyond, firstly, on recent M&A activity, we expect the net impact to be
broadly neutral on costs in 2023 and modestly positive in 2024 following the completion of the sale of our French
retail bank in the second half of 2023. Secondly, there will be a reduction in operating cost as a result of the shift
to IFRS 17, but also an associated reduction in revenues. And thirdly, from 2023 onwards, we intend to move
away from reported adjusted numbers with any further restructuring costs absorbed above the line and any large
distorting items disclosed under notable items.
Turning to capital on slide 18. Our core Tier 1 ratio was 15.8%, down 10 basis points on the third quarter.
Reported risk-weighted assets were down $1 billion on the third quarter. Risk-weighted asset saves and
improving asset quality offsetting risk-weighted asset growth from lending and regulatory change. Our cumulative
risk-weighted asset saves are now $104 billion against the three-year target of $110 billion by the end of 2022.
Given this progress, we now have an ambition to achieve $120 billion of cumulative risk-weighted asset saves by
this year end.
On the next slide, we're expecting to be within our core Tier 1 ratio of 14% to 14.5% during this year. As shown on
this table, we expect around 125 basis points of total impact during 2022 from notable items, including regulatory
change and M&A, a large part of which will be in the first quarter. It will also include the planned sale of our
French retail bank in the third quarter. Once within our 14% to 14.5% range, we intend to actively manage to be
within this range, but please recognize that due to normal capital volatility, you could see us above or below this
range in some quarters. In addition and in line with PRA regulatory guidance, the dividend will accrue at 55% of
reported profits for each quarter of 2022. This is not a signal of future dividend intentions.
And, finally, for clarity on our two buyback programs, the $2 billion buyback program that is currently underway
has to complete by 20th of April under its six-month regulatory authorization. Post the AGM in late April, we intend
to then launch the $1 billion buyback program that we announced today.

So, to conclude, in the context of a continued challenged macro environment, these were a good set of fourth
quarter and full-year 2021 results, heading into this year with strong core momentum underpinned by increasingly
robust growth and continued tight cost discipline. If the current rates outlook is maintained, we're on track to
deliver a return on tangible equity of at least 10% in 2023. That's a year earlier than our expectations at the third
quarter. And, finally and importantly, healthy capital distributions have now been restored.
With that, Martin, can we please open up for questions in the room and on the line, and Richard is coming up to
host the Q&A. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Stevenson. [Operator Instructions] The first three questions will be taken in the room.
So, I will now hand over to Mr. Richard O'Connor.

Richard O'Connor A
Head-Global Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Good morning, everybody. I'll take the first three from the room as the operator said. If you just give your
name and institution, please. Over to Raul in the front row to start with. Would you wait for the mics, please?

Raul Sinha Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Chase
Hi. Good morning. It's Raul Sinha from JPMorgan. Thanks for doing this in person. A couple of questions from me
to start. Firstly, on NIM, Ewen, I was wondering if you could unpack the moving parts across the big parts of the
franchise. So, if you look at HBAP NIM, it's broadly stable. If you look at the UK NIM, it's down quarter-on-quarter.
What is driving the sort of weakness in the UK NIM, and how do you think mortgage pricing will impact that going
forward? I think we can do our numbers on HBAP NIM going forwards.
And then the second question is just coming back to the cost discussion, perhaps more for Noel. I was quite
interested in your comments about the historical slippage in costs when rates have gone up with HSBC. And I
guess one of the things that is different this time is inflation is obviously moving up. So, I was wondering if you
could talk a little bit about how you're managing inflation. What are you seeing in terms of inflation across the
bank and how you're managing that over the medium term within your cost plans? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Do you want to go first?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So, look, on NIM – and I'm sure there'll be a few questions on NIM – in terms of what we're seeing. Look, in
the UK, I think what you're predominantly seeing is the sort of mix shift towards mortgages at the moment
impacting NIM together with continued very healthy liquidity levels. We do think over time what we'll see is a
recovery in some of the other loan books, particularly unsecured. So, you should begin to see both an improving
shift in the asset mix together with significant benefits coming through from rate rises. As you can see in our
interest rate sensitivity tables, sterling is our most sensitive currency.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 22-Feb-2022
Yeah. In Hong Kong, I don't think there's anything particular to sort of call out in terms of asset mix again. I think
the main thing, the main sort of debate I think in Hong Kong looking out is obviously Hong Kong dollar is pegged
to US dollars. Just how quickly if we are seeing and when we do see a rising US rate environment, how quickly
that will translate into a rising HIBOR. I think if you go back over time, typically there's been about a three-month
lag period. I think given Omicron at the moment, that may elongate it out a bit. But we would certainly think, in the
coming months, we'll start to see a very material recovery in HIBOR coming as well.
On costs, Noel, do you want to...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah, on costs. We've managed to contain the costs slightly down in 2021 relative to 2020. Why? Because,
frankly, we took out $3.3 billion of transformation costs in the first two years of the transformation program. That
has allowed us to fund increased investment in tech. It's allowed us to fund an increase in the variable pay pool
2021 relative to 2020 of 31%. And if you look at the VP pool, it's up 31% on 2020, it's up 5% on 2019. So, our VP
pool in 2021 still inflated over 2019 but we managed to keep the cost flat.
Now, Ewen said we're also planning a further $2 billion of cost takeout this year as part of that transformation
program and another $0.5 billion the year after. And that we believe gives us the cushion necessary to recycle
that cost transformation into investment in tech and into investment in people whilst keeping the overall cost base
flat for 2022 and within the range of 0% to 2% thereafter in 2023. And we've got good line of sights on that cost
takeout. So, I think it's manageable and achievable.
What we really want is the revenue momentum we have on an underlying level complemented by the interest rate
curve that's coming our way to actually flow through into returns, not to flow through into cost. And we're
determined to try and enhance the returns of the business, which is why we're pulling forward the return target by
a year at 10%, but we want to go beyond that. And I don't want the cost to take away from that achievement.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. I mean, so the other thing that we've had during COVID is obviously the benefit on certain activity that's just
fundamentally changed as a result of COVID. So, yeah, if you go back two years, we were spending $400 million
on travel and entertainment. That was less than $60 million last year. We expect it to recover, but we've said
we're not going to allow our travel costs to return [ph] to see (00:35:11) it's capped at 50% of what it was pre-
COVID. We've announced that we're going to get out of 40% of our non-branch based commercial real estate.
We've done about half of that so far. But, again, I think COVID and the fact that we are going to adopt hybrid
working on a permanent basis opens up a significant opportunity. I'm now hot desking and I know that our CRO
has gone and stolen a whole bunch of printers out of the building to make it harder for us to print. But for those of
you who hot desk, you certainly don't want any paper at the end of the day because then you have to store it.
So, I think, yeah, and then you've got this big shift in digital engagement from our customer base that's gone on
through COVID, particularly in some cohorts of the customer base like the elderly who previously were not that
digitally engaged. And again, I think that will open up further cost opportunities for us. And at some of those cost
opportunities, I think that have helped offset the inflationary pressure that we wouldn't have seen previously.

Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Let me give you an example on that, if we can, just, Richard, if you'd allow me.

Richard O'Connor A
Head-Global Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Trade transformation, we embarked upon a digitization program of our trade platform with the biggest trade bank
in the world. As you know, we fundamentally re-platform that business over the past four years on some modern
technology. Consequence of that, trade revenue for the full year last year was up 9%. Trade balance is up over
23%. If you look at Q4 on Q4, trade revenue was up around about 20%. So, there's momentum in the trade in the
revenue.
But what it's also done is it increased our NPS scores. We now got a positive NPS in trade of 69. We didn't have
that four years ago. If you also look at what it's done for costs, we've got a 26% reduction in our baseline head
count that existed in 2017 when we started that program. So, if you look at it from whatever angle, facilitating
revenue growth because we're more competitive, we got new product capability, better customer service as
evidenced in the NPS, and a lower cost to serve as evidenced in the head count in trade. That's why we put in
more money into the digitization agenda, and that's the impact it can have on the business. And I think that's why
we can recycle some of those cost savings into inflation – meeting inflation needs of the remaining employee
base.
Richard?

Joseph Dickerson Q
Analyst, Jefferies International Ltd.
Hi. Thanks. It's Joe Dickerson from Jefferies. Just a quick question on the buyback. So, is this something you
want to make a recurring feature of your capital return? Because if rates do what you think they'll do to get to your
10% return on tangible equity, you'll generate a lot of capital. So, is this something that you want to do on a
quarterly basis, $1 billion a quarter, or what's the thought process around creating some regular cadence to
buybacks?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So, well, to sort of broaden the question out, I think, Joe, I mean, yeah, our primary tool of distributions is
dividends, and we've sort of been clear that we're going to pay within a 40% to 55% payout ratio. This year we
were right at the very bottom end of that range at a 40% payout ratio. I think that reflected, yeah, our view on the
sustainability of particularly the ECL line where we had significant write-backs this year. And so, I think, going
10

forward, you should expect, certainly for 2022, our expectation is that we'll be higher up on that payout range than
last year.
In terms of buybacks, we pointed out today that if you were to sort of effectively, if you want, normalize our core
Tier 1 today for items that we know that are coming such as regulatory change and M&A, the 15.8% is probably
closer to 14.5% today for that 125 basis points of adjustments we pointed out.
Yeah. So, we do – yeah. And then you've got for this year I think, yeah, the natural growth in the business where
we said we're targeting mid-single-digit loan growth. We've pointed out that we still think we've got $14 billion or
more to do with RWA saves. We've got the dividend. We've got the incremental $1 billion buyback that we
announced today. We do still expect there to be some inorganic activity. Yeah. They will be similar to what we've
done, small bolt-on deals.
I think consensus for this year is sitting about $2 billion of buybacks. I think we're reasonably comfortable with that
consensus at the moment. But we do intend overall to actively manage our capital base as we said. But for this
year, I think we're sort of comfortable with where consensus currently sit. But you shouldn't view this buyback
program as some sort of in perpetuity buyback program. We'll use it to manage surplus capital.

Omar Keenan Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd.
Good morning. Omar Keenan at Credit Suisse. Thank you for the presentation today. I've got two questions,
please. So, one on rate sensitivity and then just a second one on the outlook for acquisitions and divestments. So,
firstly on rate sensitivity, thank you for the disclosure on the deposit beta. I was wondering if you could help us
with how much discretion HSBC has over its deposit pricing in places like Hong Kong I guess with the idea being
that the surplus deposit position is quite good and the benefit for rate hikes might be much more than the
guidance implies earlier on than later on.
And then, secondly on the outlook for acquisitions and divestments. So, you've completed the three bolt-on
acquisitions that you said you would do, and you've also completed or at least signed the exit from the French and
US Retail business. Could you comment on how the footprint now looks like? And, I guess, just bearing in mind
that there's a bit of movement in Mexico with what Citigroup is doing and whether there's more potential for bolt-
ons, whether we could see more inorganic activity at HSBC. Thank you.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 22-Feb-2022
Yeah. Look, on rate sensitivity, I think, as we said, we would certainly assume that for the first few rate rises, the
deposit beta is going to be less than 50%. I mean, it's a matter of public record what our intentions are in the UK.
We've announced a series of deposit increases as of the 1st of March. They would imply a deposit beta well
below 50% for the rate rises that we've seen. Hong Kong, we are the market leader in the market. So, we would
expect there to be some increase in deposit rates. But, again, I think for the first 50 or so of rate rises, the deposit
betas we would expect to be well below 50%.
Yeah. So, just to explain that, we did change the table for this quarter. Previously, we had a sort of average 50%
deposit beta, but it varied by market. So, what you see, for example, is that Hong Kong sensitivity has come down
in that table relative to Q3. The reason for that is because we have effectively increased the deposit beta up to
50%. We just thought that was easier for you because it gave a consistent basis for you to then make your own
assumptions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Just one other point to know, and I'm sure you've got it in your analysis. And that is – and I was talking to
somebody earlier about my liking of cash and that it's positive, particularly when you bring it in via operating
accounts. And a lot of the cash deposits we bring in is not paid for deposits through savings accounts. It's
operating accounts through GLCM, through Personal Banking, through wealth management. And therefore, what
we're able to see is a higher ability to hold on to interest rate rises because we are so focused on bringing in
operating accounts [indiscernible] (00:44:01) for in deposits. And that's particularly true in our Asia franchise
where we've drawn in a lot of balances via GLCM business.

Richard O'Connor A
Head-Global Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
The question on M&A, do you want to...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
M&A, yeah, I'll take that. Listen, we're pleased with the progress we've made on that. We're pleased with the
disposal decisions on the US and on France. I think Michael has done an excellent job and his team in the US on
executing on time, on schedule, and driving out the costs as a consequence of that. Really congratulate him on
that. We're on track for completing a more complex disposal program on the French retail business. Hence, it will
complete in 2023. But we knew that to be the case. The plans are progressing well on that.
On the bolt-ons, going well. We're still looking. We're observing other opportunities in the market, particularly in
Asia, particularly associated with wealth and for wealth [indiscernible] (00:45:19) insurance, asset management,
and broader wealth management capability. As and when any of those become a reality if they do become a
12

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 22-Feb-2022
reality, we'll let you know at that point in time. But we still have to look in our opportunities on the acquisition side
there.
Stress, it's bolt-on. And to maybe turn to your specific question on Mexico, no, we're not looking to acquire in
Mexico. We have a good business in Mexico. It produced returns on tangible equity last year of around about
13% I think. Within that, the wealth business and retail business in Mexico has higher inherent returns. We've got
an organic growth model there. We'd previously guided the market and all of you that our M&A activity would be
primarily focused on Asia and on wealth. Excuse me for all those online who just heard me sneeze. Very sorry
about that and it's not COVID, honestly. So, I think we've got a very clear focus on where we want the bolt-ons to
be focused on. Thank you.

Tom and then I'll take one from the line.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tom Rayner Q
Analyst, Numis Securities Ltd.
Yes, sir. Thank you very much. It's Tom Rayner from Numis. Could I just have two, please, just sticking with the
rate sensitivity initially. The thing I'm most interested in is how quickly will the sensitivity sort of fade away once
you go beyond 100 basis points move, because I guess you're going to see pass-through rates increasing as
rates rise. Also, I imagine there'll be some asset spread issues such as in the Hong Kong mortgage market with
sort of caps versus prime, etcetera. So, I just wonder if you could give us a bit more color on how things look
when you go beyond the 100 basis points.
And I have a second question on costs. And if you want it now or – the guidance 0% to 2% from 2023, I'm just
wondering what's going to sort of determine where about you land in that range, whether you're running a sort of
jaws target if you like. So, if revenue is stronger, you'll be at the upper end. And if revenue disappoints, you'll be
looking to hold it down at the bottom. Is that you're thinking there? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. So, on rate sensitivity above 100 basis points, that's not a question we often get asked, but we're pleased
we're getting asked. I mean, if you look – I mean, I guess going back to where we were in 2019, the NIM at the
time was 158 basis points. It fell to 120 basis points last year. We lost I thought about $7 million of net interest
income to book the average interest earning assets bigger than where it was back in 2019.
So, you're right, in some markets like Hong Kong there is this relationship with the prime rate, which does start to
factor heavily in once rates rise by more than 100 basis points. So, if I were you, I would look at the trajectory of
what happened from sort of 2019 through 2021. And then it's not quite analogous because sterling rates are going
to be much higher this time, but try and draw some comparisons from there as you do your modeling.
On costs, we're certainly not targeting a jaws number. It's hard to target jaws when you've got rising interest rates
and you don't want the benefit of those rising interest rates to get reflected into rising costs. So, I think it just
highlights a decent degree of uncertainty is where we are on inflation, yeah. When you go out into 2023, we've got
the impact of M&A that we've highlighted, there'll also be that one-off from IFRS 17, which will take cost down.
That's not on that guidance but you do have to model that.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 22-Feb-2022
We know that we've got at least $0.5 billion of cost savings coming through from the cost programs that we're
running. We are going to have to – we're getting rid of the cost to achieve program in 2022. So, it's definitely
finishing at the end of this year. So, any restructuring costs will be absorbed above the line.
I would say, in addition to that cost guidance, because we're comparing sort of what we call adjusted to adjusted.
Typically, at the moment, we're having about $0.5 billion of other costs that would be in sig items being sort of
large litigation costs and when we sell businesses and stuff, the losses on sale of that. So, in addition to that
adjusted cost guidance, typically there's about $0.5 billion or so of other items, which will be on top of that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Tom, it's a good question, but just to put it into context.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tom Rayner Q
Analyst, Numis Securities Ltd.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
So, it's hard to predict how inflation will move forward over the next year or two, but there's likely to be inflation
there, somewhere between no cost increases on a like-for-like basis and $600 million is the 2% relative to if you
roll the clock back and you rolled in the interest rates effect that we lost $7 billion. So, the 0% to 2% is relatively
insensitive whether it's 0%, 1% or 2% relative to what could be $6 billion or $7 billion of incremental revenue by
that time.
And I think what we're trying to signal very clearly is we're not looking to have an explosion in costs just because
interest rates are going to come through and to contain it in the 0% to 2% range is a reasonably flat cost base
relative to what could be happening on revenue.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I mean, if you look at consensus that has existed a couple of weeks ago, yeah, there was about a $6 billion
increase or 12% increase in revenues from 2021 through 2023. And we're saying we're going to keep cost growth
to 2% over that period. And I think 2023 consensus, as it was a couple of weeks ago, is understated because it
hasn't fully reflected the impact of rate rises.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
So, the rate rises in that consensus a few weeks ago is inconsistent with today's curve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
So, if you just take those numbers, you've got very, very material jaws coming through.

Richard O'Connor A
Head-Global Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
Okay. We'll open the lines to hopefully Jason Napier of UBS.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Napier Q
Analyst, UBS AG (London Branch)
Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is around that revenue growth number that, Noel,
you just shared. If I just focus on net interest income, your annualized in the fourth quarter of $27 billion, 5% loan
growth gets you to $28.5 billion, and half the rate gearing that you've given today on a beta that's too high, we'd
see NII over $30 billion in 2022. And the same math would get you, at minimum, $35 billion or $36 billion in 2023.
Ewen, in the past, you've helped us with sort of blunt expectations around NII. I'm sure you don't want the market
to get too carried away. But it appears to me that on the simple loan growth and rate gearing numbers you
provided, the consensus should be substantially higher, $2 billion or $3 billion for this year and maybe $3 billion
for next year. That's the first one.
The second question is around the shape of the group from a capital perspective. Most of the RWA savings work
has been done and yet the TNAV share of Asia is roughly stable at about 42% of the group. And I just wondered
whether the restructuring of balance sheets and the moving of capital around the group shouldn't lead to faster
RWA growth in the years ahead or was it really more about taking capital out of low return destinations. So,
should we be expecting faster growth out of Asia now that those capital has been freed up from its [ph] past uses
(00:53:51)? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I'll take the second question. Do you wanted to take the first?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. You know I hate forecasting net interest income and NIM. But anyway, I'll do my best to talk about it. I did
think, Jason, we think – and I don't know why in your math but you are a bit [ph] toppy (00:54:14) on 2022. Yeah.
We think that consensus, which was at – we had a – yeah, we think consensus for 2022, which we had a $28.7
billion, was understated but not by the magnitude that you're talking about. And the consensus that was
published, the average consensus were $31.9 billion for 2023. We think that is more meaningfully understated.
And I don't know whether, Jason, how you factored in things like the continued RWA rundown program. Because
if you look at what's basically implied with our risk-weighted asset growth this year, yeah, if we're talking about
mid-single digits, we're saying 3% of that is coming from regulatory change, so there's a sort of net, call it, 2
percentage points of net increase which is underlying loan growth yet less the RWAs we're running off. But – so,
modestly understated for 2022; more materially understated for 2023.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
On your second point, the share of the group, I'd probably draw your attention to two slides in the deck, the slide
28 and slide 30. Slide 28 is a new piece of information I don't think we've previously disclosed. But what it shows
15


HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2021 Earnings Call 22-Feb-2022
for wholesale banking is the interconnectivity of the group. So, if you look at the percentage of client revenue in
wholesale banking that has an international connectivity, those clients bank with us in multiple geographies, that
percentage is 77%.
Now, what you see in the report and accounts is where we book it in the legal entity. So, you see legal entity
booking in Asia, and you'll see legal entity booking in Europe and the US. But so much of what we book in Europe
and the US is connected to our business in Asia and the Middle East. And what we try to give you in that is, in
wholesale banking terms, essentially 70% – 77% of our revenue from clients in wholesale banking has some form
of cross-border connectivity, but you'll see that revenue booked in multiple legal entities. So, I think your analysis
on how much capital is Asia-related relative to non-Asia is a bit distorted when you look at a legal entity basis.
And, if you then go to slide 30, what you will see from GB&M is 40% of the revenue booked in the East, on our
legal entity balance sheets in the East, emerges from Western clients. So, 40% of Greg and Georges' revenue
essentially gets booked in the East but originates from clients we bank in Europe, the UK, the US in the West.
And that, again, if you look at it purely on a legal entity basis, you'll see European and US balance sheets and
say, why are they so capital-heavy? It's because they're a feeder of business into our operations in Asia and the
Middle East.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Jason, I think in addition to what Noel's just went through, I mean, if you go back to what we announced a
couple of years ago about this $100-odd billion of RWA reduction in the West and redeployment in the East, what
we've seen over the last couple of years, I think, is a very successful execution of the first part of that, i.e. that
we're now in excess of what we started out with. But the redeployment in the East has been slowed down as a
result of COVID. So, we do think that that redeployment rate will now pick up as the Asian economies
progressively come out of COVID.

Benjamin Toms Q

Good morning and thank you, both, for taking my questions. Two, please. Firstly, your flow mortgage market
share in the UK picked up significantly in Q4. Do you intend to keep being aggressive in terms of pricing and
growth in the UK?
And then, secondly, you took a top-up provisions for Chinese commercial real estate in the quarter. Can you just
give us some flavor on what you're seeing on the ground in respect to the Chinese CRE? And is it still the indirect
exposure there that keeps you awake at night? Thank you.

HSBC Holdings Plc
(HSBC) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2021 Earnings Call 22-Feb-2022
Yeah. So, on, yeah, our flow market share in the quarter, I think, was 9.3%. Our stock share is 7.5%. I think, as
you all know, we still feel structurally underweight in UK mortgages. Our share of current accounts by value, I
think, has ticked up to just under 15% now. So, we still feel structurally underweight mortgages. I don't think we'd
describe our pricing as aggressive. We don't necessarily aspire to be in the top three of the best buy tables, but
we do think we can continue to take market share above our stock share.
I think a notable feature of what we saw in the market, which you'll all be familiar with is this was the first quarter
for quite a while I think where our front book margins were below back book margins and have continued to drop
a bit in Q1 as well. Yeah, we've also seen a significant increase in risk-weighted assets for UK mortgages from
the beginning of this year. We still think we're earning returns comfortably above the cost of capital at this point.
But, yeah, conditions are competitive at the moment in the UK mortgage market.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. And on China real estate, listen, there was no doubt that in Q4 the level of market uncertainty increased
and the level of contagion risk on that whole sector of commercial real estate in China increased relative to Q2 or
Q3. And therefore, we thought it wise and prudent to model in additional Stage 1 and Stage 2 provisions to reflect
that uncertainty, that refinancing risk and that liquidity risk. We've seen the market conditions ease a bit at the
start of 2022. We think that is likely to have a benefit on the risk position on commercial real estate in China. Time
will tell. It's still too early to tell how it will all play out. It's affected pretty much every private CRE client in China.
As Ewen said, we have a mixture of POEs and SOEs in that sector, around about 30%/70%, 30% SOEs, 70% or
so POEs. Time will tell as to whether that sector has more losses come in or not. But we thought it wise to model
in some additional provisions based on that level of uncertainty.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

We think – sorry. The one thing I will also say, we still stand by the fact we have good quality clients that we've
known for a long time, operating in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities with good properties. But the sector as a whole has a
level of uncertainty over it that's affecting all of them.

And that – yeah, all of that thinking that Noel has just went through is behind our guidance when we've talked
about approaching 30 basis points of ECL provisions for this year, which I would note is probably more
conservative guidance than is in current consensus.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Aman Rakkar Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
Yeah. Good morning. It's Aman Rakkar from Barclays. I would have two, please. One, back on rate sensitivity,
one thing that's always kind of I found remarkable for a number of quarters now is how low your USD rate
sensitivity is. I think even on the updated deposit pass-through assumption relative to the $460 billion of deposits,
I think, that you can imply from slide 27, why is that rate sensitivity so low out of the US? Does it imply a lot of
hedging? Is there something you can kind of help us understand there?
And second would be on aspirations for Wealth Management. Note the cautious guidance in relation to Q1. I
guess, I'm specifically thinking about the border between Hong Kong and China reopening. Is there any way you
could help us quantify what the potential benefit could be if we were to rediscover pre-COVID level of activity for
that business? I mean, I know it looks like the onshore Hong Kong insurance franchises has done really well last
year, so maybe there's a bit of easing there. But anything you can help us put some numbers to that would be
really helpful. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yes. In the US dollar, there's effectively an accounting mismatch which is driving that lack of sensitivity, and part
of the funding base in the US is used to fund the trading book. So, in a rising rate environment, the benefit from
an accounting – the accounting benefit on the revenue side goes to trading income so you don't get that normal
rate sensitivity that you would expect. I think on the border reopening, if you go back to 2019, I think about 40% of
our new business sales on insurance were to Mainland Chinese. So, yeah, keep the current profile of the
domestic business in Hong Kong and assume going back to 2019 levels or higher as that border reopens.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aman Rakkar Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
Sorry. Just on that first rate sensitivity point then, is that additional rate sensitivity that goes through noninterest
income or are you saying that actually...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
And just on Wealth, we've covered it a bit in the slide there. I just do want to reemphasize, because it was such an
important plank of our strategy, Asia wealth. Just draw out some stats. Net new invested assets in our Wealth
business was up 21% year-on-year last year. That's despite a bit of a slowdown in Q4. But for the full year, it was
up 21%. Trade Wealth balances was up 5%. The invested assets of Wealth was up 7%. So, the net new money
was up 21%. But the overall balance sheet of invested assets was up 7%. Asset management was up 5% year-
on-year. That's full year-full year. And Wealth revenues were up 10%. So, that's with a relatively subdued sort of
cross-border activity flow that's just driving the domestic markets.
What we're also investing in is China. So, what we're trying to do is we got a strong business that we've invested
in in Hong Kong. We're now investing in China through the joint venture, taking a full ownership of the joint
venture of our insurance and wealth business there and organically invested in Pinnacle, 3,000 people over the
next few years. So, we want to drive stronger domestic growth in China, stronger domestic growth in Hong Kong,
and then connect them through the likes of Wealth Connect and [ph] Stock Connect (01:06:39). And that's where I
think we got the icing on the cake, you can say, when the border opens up. So, I think there's still strong
underlying growth for the medium-term. And although we're signaling a softening in Q1, there's a strong track
record of the Hong Kong economy bouncing back. And I think that's what will happen at some point later this year.

Morning, thanks. It's Guy Stebbings from BNP Paribas Exane. First question was back on income sort of building
on the last question. And thanks for the comments already on net interest income and sort of reflecting on where
consensus is. I guess, for other operating income, it sounds like it's going be a tough start to 2022 and you've
refrained from giving guidance for this year on revenues versus the medium-term double digit guidance. Just
wondering if your sense is that potentially a bit of a giveback to the NII upside this year from some of those trends

on – although I appreciate it's very difficult to judge in this environment, but any color there? And would you see
that very much as a short-term issue and indeed there could be potential catch-up on that line as the environment
normalizes, so any distortion is really isolated to 2022? I mean, indeed your medium-term guidance is right to be
35% of group suggests a rapid pace of growth to come through at some point in the future.
And then the second question was just on cost, and thanks for calling out the restructuring is going to be above
the line from 2022. I think that's a very helpful development. It also goes against what we're seeing at a number of
banks in terms of talking about perennially higher restructuring-type costs than maybe we've expected in the past.
And in that context, naught to 2% cost growth over two years looks like a very good target to hit if you do indeed
manage to reach that. Just wondering what gives you confidence you can do that if there are still some
investment-type actions. We are in an inflation environment. I mean, is it just a sense of the amount of run rate
cost saves coming through the business give you that significant comfort you can deliver that? Thank you.

Yeah. On the non-interest income, I guess, I haven't made the same comments versus the consensus because
that should be a [ph] hint (01:08:59). But look, I – in Q1 just, we've had a couple of things going on. Firstly, we've
had weak markets in Asia, which is impacting both the insurance MCU, the market impact, and also impacting
equity brokerage. We've now got about half of the branch network temporarily closed in Hong Kong at the
direction HKMA as a result of the COVID-19 restrictions.
And, you know, Q1 is typically our best quarter for selling Wealth product and a lot of that is sold through the
branch network. So, yeah, if we've looked at what's happened in every other market with the Omicron, it's been a
three-month thing, and then the economies are reopened again.
So, yeah, we do think it is short-dated in nature, and we're sort of not trying to re-guide on 2023 at this point. So, I
do think that there could be some disappointment in Wealth in Q1 but, by the time that you get back into Q2, with
the Hong Kong reopening, we should see a really rapid recovery.
And on – sorry – what was the second question, the second question?

Costs again.

Noel Quinn A

...and why are we confident on the north to 2%?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. And so – but we've done, if you go back to 2018, you know, the back-end of the year that I joined, you
know, we had a – you know, we grew costs at about 5.5% that year. We did exactly what went wrong not to do
now, which is we were trying to inflate the cost base in line with, the rising rates.
And since then, we've done an enormous amount of work to sort of embed good cost discipline across the
organization in a way that didn't exist three years ago. We've got a very well drilled cost program at the moment. I
would say if you just – the investment that we're making into various parts of the bank and digitalization and
automation can drive out huge potential cost savings in some areas.
If I look at what I'm trying to do in finance at the moment, we've got a big move to take all of our reporting into a
single dataset on the cloud and run over our reporting engines off the cloud. We think that can reduce operating
costs and finance by 25% to 30% over the next three to four years. And yeah, it's the same analogy that Noel
used in the front office with the trade transformation that we've done in the last few years.
So, I think we've got confidence as we look at the combination of those investment programs going on. In
addition, we are continuing to effectively, if you were to cut our cost structure on a geographic basis, what you see
is the mature markets are declining, so Europe, UK, US, Canada which is allowing us to fund the growth that we
want to put on in the Middle East, Asia or in Mexico.
So, it's a complex mix of costs, actions going on across the organization but, we do think that based on the work
that we've done today there's pretty good bottom up grounding for the cost targets and we obviously don't put
them out lightly because Noel and I know that you'll remind us if we miss them.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
So, I'd say we got the bottom-up analysis. We got the benefit of a committed three-year transformation program,
two years into it. We delivered what we said. We will continue that in year three this year. So, it's a combination of
bottom-up and, frankly, determination. I want that revenue benefit to go into the return, to go into the P&L, not just
to be spent on incremental cost. And I'm trying to get a much more stable cost base to the organization over time
and not have it cyclical – high rates, high costs, low rates, low costs. I'd much rather have a much more efficient
machine that is constantly re-engineering itself, and technology is playing a big role in it. Hence, we spent more
than $6 billion on tech last year.
And if you take the guidance, we said that was 19% of our operating costs, and we want to take – we're willing to
take it north of 21% of operating costs. If you roll that forward over a period of time, over through two or three
years, that will take $6 billion up to $7 billion. So, implicit in that incremental IT investment is a reengineering of
our fundamental processes. We saw the impact of digitization on trade. We're seeing the same thing in the
21

payments arena. We've got a similar program running on our wealth business, reengineering our frontline Internet
banking capability. Build it once, roll it globally, you get scale globally. So, yeah, that's what we're working on.
Richard, there was one more in there.

Yeah. We've got time for two more, one [indiscernible] (01:14:17) behind you. And then [indiscernible]
(01:14:21)...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A

And then, Martin, well, we'll see if we can still fit you in. But we will have to wrap up. Okay?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Hi. It's [ph] Perlie Mong (01:14:29) from KBW. So, thanks for the presentation. Just two questions, one on income.
So, well, actually, loan growth really. So, you've delivered 1% loan growth in 2021. So, sort of what gives you the
confidence that you're going to be able to do mid-single-digits in 2022 given Hong Kong and China still very much
sticking to zero COVID policy, so sort of putting a lid on growth there? And sort of related to that, if you are
thinking about mid-single-digit loan growth and in a rising rate environment, why are you only targeting mid-single-
digit revenue growth, again sort of building on a previous question? So, that's on revenue side.
And then on costs, you've talked a lot about digitization and investment in technology. Roughly, what is the split
between maintenance spend and innovation spend?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I'll come – I'll do the last question on innovation and maintenance. Ewen, you want to take the loan growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ewen James Stevenson A
Group Chief Financial Officer & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Look, on loan growth, I think, yeah, 2021 was heavily distorted by a couple of things. Firstly, the impact of
COVID in the first half of the year which, I think, had a significant dampening effect on loan growth in the first half.
I think what we've seen coming through now, we've had it in Commercial for some time, just continued quarter-on-
quarter loan growth. I think in Retail, we're seeing very, very good growth in mortgages both in the UK and Hong
Kong. Despite what you referred to in Hong Kong, underlying loan growth there in the mortgage sector continues
to be very robust. But the other big offset which [ph] has knocked (01:16:14) is the rundown that we've seen in
wholesale and Global Banking markets in particular which has dampened that growth rate. But if you look at Q4,
the Q4 growth rate, I think it doesn't take much to get that growth rate up on an annualized basis to mid-single-
digits.

[indiscernible] (01:16:35) rate in CMB, Q4-to-Q4, in Asia loans was 9%, I think. If you take trade Q4-to-Q4, growth
in the balance sheet in CMB, I think, was 29%. So, what you saw was a slow start in the first half of the year and
then a pickup in the second half of the year. Trade grew faster earlier than term lending, and term lending started
to pick up in the second half of the year. As economies came out of COVID, they first went to reactivate the
supply chain and then they went to reactivate some of the term lending. I still think term lending is quite muted at
the moment. I don't think there's a huge amount of capital investment taking place, but we're starting to see some
early signs of that come through in Q4. I think we just have to wait and see how economic recovery continues in
the first half of this year.
And then, your other question on how much of the investment in technology is innovation versus maintenance.
Listen, the term innovation can mean many different things to many different people, so I don't use that term
necessarily for IT investment. What I'm looking at is how much of that investment is fundamentally reengineering
the business as opposed to doing care and maintenance on today's systems for regulatory reasons. And I think
more and more of our technology is going into the reengineering space and less into the care and maintenance.
We don't give a breakdown on that, but it got a significant proportion of our investment, circa over 50% is going
into the reengineering activities of the bank. Not just keeping the lights on and maintaining the existing systems;
we're investing in reengineering.
And take trade as an example. We fundamentally replatformed the whole software base for trade. So, we're
turning off the old and turned on the new – turning on the new. And that has multiple benefits. It lowers the
ongoing running costs of technology. It lowers the ongoing running costs of the bank. It provides new product
capability, a better customer experience, better operational control. We're doing that in many other areas as well.

Listen, thank you very much for attending today and for all of your interest and your questions.
To sum up, I'm pleased with our 2021 performance. Particularly pleased with the return to revenue growth in Q4
which, I think, bodes well for 2022. We've got a good cost control and we're determined to maintain it.

Based on the current interest rate assumptions, we would expect a RoTE of at least 10% in 2023 and a year
earlier than previously planned. We've made good progress executing against our key areas of our strategy and
our transformation, and I'm pleased that we were also able to provide our shareholders with healthy capital
