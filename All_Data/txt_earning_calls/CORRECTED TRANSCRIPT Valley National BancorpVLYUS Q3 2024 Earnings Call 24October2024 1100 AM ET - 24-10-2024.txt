Q3 2024 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2024
With that, I'll turn the call over to Ira Robbins.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Travis. During the third quarter of 2024, Valley reported net income of approximately $98 million and
diluted earnings per share of $0.18. This compared to net income and EPS of $70 million and $0.13 a quarter
ago. The significant improvement in earnings was broad-based and primarily the result of top line revenue
expansion and continued expense management. Our provision for loan losses declined during the quarter, but
exceeded our third quarter guidance primarily as a result of the significant growth in C&I loans and unfunded C&I
commitments, as well as a discrete reserve for the potential impacts of Hurricane Helene. Exclusive of these
variables, the third quarter provision would have been in line with our prior guidance.
I'm extremely pleased with the financial progress made during the quarter. The continued improvement in our
balance sheet metrics has been achieved in conjunction with a solid rebound in pre-provision revenue. Tom and
Mike will detail the key contributing factors to this improvement. But as we work through our 2025 financial plans,
we anticipate further profitability improvement reflecting an anticipated net interest income tailwind and the
normalization of credit costs.
Slide 4 illustrates the significant progress that we continue to make towards our balance sheet goals. Our diligent
management of new commercial real estate originations and renewals has contributed meaningfully to the 53-
percentage-point year-to-date reduction in our stated CRE concentration ratio at September 30. This progress
has been supplemented by organic capital growth and our recent preferred stock issuance. Throughout the year,
we have patiently monitored the market for a potential sale of CRE loans to further accelerate our progress
relative to CRE concentration, capital, and funding flexibility.
I'm pleased to report that in the fourth quarter, we expect to sell upwards of $800 million of performing commercial
real estate loans to a single investor at an extremely attractive 1% discount. The characteristics of the pool that
we expect to sell are consistent with our broader portfolio in many ways. The underwriting and credit metrics are
very similar, though these loans tend to be somewhat larger. From an asset class perspective, there is a tilt
towards more industrial and less office as you may expect, though the pool is geographically diverse, consistent
with our broader portfolio. This transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter and reflects the underlying
credit strength of our portfolio and our continued ability to enhance our balance sheet in shareholder-friendly
ways.
As I have previously stated, commercial real estate is a terrific asset class and one that has provided excellent
risk-adjusted returns for our company. While the transactional elements of our portfolio continue to wind down, we
remain focused on supporting the clients that have more holistic banking relationships with Valley. There are
opportunities to further penetrate these banking relationships and expand this client base without applying undue
pressure to our balance sheet.
While the transfer of loans to held-for-sale helped to improve our period-end loan-to-deposit ratio, we anticipate
using a significant portion of loan sale proceeds to repay maturing brokered deposits in the fourth quarter of 2024.
Regulatory capital ratios are expected to benefit by 16 basis points to 20 basis points as a result of the sale, all
else equal, and this transactions positions us to achieve our near-term CET1 goal of approximately 9.8% by the
end of 2024.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2024
The ongoing execution of our strategic initiatives positions us to exceed most of our previously announced
intermediate term balance sheet goals sooner than anticipated. To this end, we now expect that our CRE
concentration ratio will be approximately 375% by the end of 2025, as compared to our prior intermediate term
goal of 400%. Similarly, and largely as a result of our recent and anticipated future C&I growth, we now expect
that our allowance coverage ratio will be approximately 1.25% by the end of 2025 relative to our current 1.14%
coverage level. This implies a much slower pace of reserve build over the next five quarters and particularly
throughout the course of 2025.
Slide 6 highlights our expectations for the fourth quarter of 2024. We anticipate that continued growth in our C&I
and consumer portfolios will contribute to low single-digit annualized loan growth during the quarter. As a result of
the anticipated CRE loan sale, we expect net interest income will decline somewhat in the fourth quarter.
However, exclusive of the sale, net interest income will likely grow modestly as our recent experience in reducing
customer deposit costs following the September Fed action offset the impact of lower frontend rates on our
floating rate loans.
Our expectations for noninterest income and noninterest expense are generally unchanged from the prior
quarter's guidance. From a credit perspective, the general improvement in the commercial real estate backdrop
has helped to isolate the few lingering issues that may result in credit losses. Our ongoing analysis of these
situations and the potential impact of Hurricanes Helene and Milton could result in higher net charge-offs during
the fourth quarter. These factors, combined with our continued C&I growth expectations, are likely to result in a
year-end allowance coverage ratio of approximately 1.20%. With all of this in mind, we expect to be well-
positioned for credit performance normalization in 2025.
Finally, I want to offer our team's thoughts to the Valley customers, employees, and communities that have been
impacted by the recent hurricanes in our southeast markets. Unfortunately, we have all been through many of
these weather events and we know the toll that can take upon individuals and businesses. Valley is always there
for those in need and we have proactively offered our support to the communities that have been in the path of
these storms.
With that, I would turn the call over to Tom and Mike to discuss the quarter's financial highlights and results. After
Mike concludes his remarks, Tom, Mike, myself, and Mark Saeger, our Chief Credit Officer, will be available for
your questions.

Thank you, Ira. Slide 9 illustrates the quarter's deposit trends. Total deposits increased approximately $300 million
compared to the second quarter, largely due to higher levels of direct customer deposits. We are very pleased
that a portion of this growth was the result of expansion in noninterest deposit balances. During the quarter, we
added roughly 25,000 new deposit accounts, with nearly 11,000 of these being on the noninterest-bearing side.
While there was very little impact on the quarter's results, we have now reduced customer deposit costs by
approximately 22 basis points since the September Fed rate cut. This implies a 44% total deposit beta, which is
somewhat better than our modeling. Importantly, direct customer balances have continued to trend higher during
October.
The next slide provides more detail on the composition of our deposit portfolio by delivery channel and business
line. Growth trends in our international and technology segment and other commercial verticals were strong
during the quarter.

Slide 11 illustrates the components of the quarter's lending activity. We continue to execute on our strategic
initiative to enhance C&I and deemphasize multifamily and investor CRE loans. C&I growth remained in the mid-
teens on an annualized basis for the second consecutive quarter and remains broad-based across our
geographies and business lines. On an organic basis, multifamily and investor CRE declined by $700 million
during the quarter as we experienced an uptick in prepayment activity as interest rates have fallen. Ira provided
details on the additional transfer of over $800 million of high-quality CRE loans to held-for-sale during the quarter.
We are extremely pleased with the pricing on this transaction, which will help to accelerate our strategic initiatives.
While new origination yields have declined in line with broader interest rates, our portfolio yield continues to
decline. As a reminder, 40% of our loan portfolio floats based on shorter-term rate indices. This makes us
modestly asset-sensitive from a structural perspective, but incremental origination activity and the opportunity to
outperform our deposit betas should offset some of this headwind.
Slide 12 provides additional detail on the composition of our commercial real estate portfolio by property type and
geography, as adjusted for the transfer of loans to held-for-sale in the third quarter. In general, the commercial
real estate markets and borrower performance across our footprint remain healthy. Ira previously mentioned that
a few select loans will likely impact our net charge-off experience in the fourth quarter. These are identified and
isolated situations and we are beginning to see the underpinnings of stability in terms of criticized and classified
migration.
With that, I will turn the call over to Mike Hagedorn to provide additional insight into the quarter's financials.

Michael D. Hagedorn
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Tom. Staying on the CRE topic for a moment, slide 15 illustrates the contractual maturities of our
commercial real estate portfolio. We've included the LTV, DSCR, and rate by maturity bucket for your benefit. This
maturity schedule continues to illustrate the minimal near-term repricing risk that exists in our portfolio.
Slide 16 highlights the continued expansion in both net interest income and net interest margin during the third
quarter. Interest income is now generally in line with the level a year ago. As Ira mentioned, we expect to close on
the sale of over $800 million of commercial real estate loans during this quarter. We anticipate that a significant
portion of these proceeds will pay out maturing brokered deposits. Consequently, we expect this sale to weigh on
net interest income by approximately $5 million during the fourth quarter, all else equal. To reiterate, we were very
quick to lower deposit costs across the franchise in the wake of the September Fed action. In total, we reduced
deposit costs by roughly 22 basis points on our $40-plus billion of customer deposits. As customer deposits have
continued to grow, we remain confident in our ability to [indiscernible] (12:39) additional Fed rate cuts which may
occur.
Turning to the next slide, you can see the detail on our noninterest income. Adjusted noninterest income for the
quarter excludes both a $7-million benefit for litigation settlement and a $6-million negative mark-to-market
adjustment on the transfer of loans to held-for-sale. Exclusive of these items adjusted noninterest income
increased significantly as compared to the second quarter of 2024. This was primarily due to increases in tax
credit advisory, service charges on deposits, and other income. Deposit service charges benefited from fees
related to updated pricing on treasury services capabilities, which started in mid-August and we expect additional
tailwinds in this area on a go-forward basis.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2024
On the following slide, you can see that our noninterest expenses were approximately $270 million for the quarter.
Exclusive of the amortization of tax credit investments, adjusted noninterest expenses were approximately $264
million. This represents a decrease from the second quarter of 2024 and general stability relative to the third
quarter of 2023. Expenses benefited from a decrease in technology-related and compensation costs. Our ability
to control operating expenses without sacrificing necessary investment opportunities remains a hallmark of our
organization. We continue to model modest expense growth to support our aspirations, but will work to offset
these investments as we have done recently.
On slide 19, you can see the continued and notable stability in our non-accrual loans. Roughly 85% of the
sequential increase in past-due loans was related to a pair of CRE loans. Both loans are well-secured and we
anticipate near-term resolution without loss of principal.
The next slide illustrates the trend in allowance coverage, charge-offs, and provision. Our allowance coverage
ratio increased 8 basis points for the second consecutive quarter, partially driven by substantial growth in C&I
loans and unfunded C&I commitments, as well as the allowance set aside for Hurricane Helene. We expect that
allowance coverage will expand towards 1.2% in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of these same factors.
From a longer-term perspective, we believe that credit costs will normalize meaningfully in 2025 and result in a
much slower pace of reserve build.
The next slide illustrates the sequential increase in our tangible book value and capital ratios. Tangible book value
benefited from a reduction in the OCI impact associated with our available-for-sale portfolio during the quarter.
Our Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios increased as a result of our Series C preferred stock issuance during
the third quarter. As Ira mentioned, the CRE sale planned for November will likely add to an additional 16 basis
points to 20 basis points to each risk-based capital ratio.
With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator to begin Q&A. Thank you.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Your
line is open.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Morning, Jon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
This all looks good, but maybe, Mike or Ira, on the last comment, you were talking about provision and reserves
and maybe more normalizing in 2025. What does that really mean and look like? Is that a return to provision
levels that are more like pre-second quarter, is that what you're signaling to us?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, I don't have second quarter in front of me, so I'm not quite sure. But I think we spent a lot of time during the
course of the year looking at our portfolio and really assessing what type of credits we have in there today. And as
we really begin to see the environment normalize a little bit, we feel really strong and confident about what those
numbers begin to look like. I think as we've guided towards what 2025 is going to look like, I think we have some
internal thoughts regarding what those net charge-off numbers are going to be, which are much lower than what
you're seeing this quarter. And then there's [ph] only an (17:29) incremental build really needed to get to that [ph]
$125 million (17:31), so much more in line, I think, with what you would have historically seen at Valley, which
really creates optimism within the organization as we see the tailwind on the margin and tailwind regarding what
the credit's going to look like as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. So, the reserve building is going forward more about the mix of loans and not necessarily about any need
to build for the existing portfolio? Is that fair?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
And I'll let Mark maybe address that a little bit. But I think as we have emphasized the shift in building some C&I
loans within the organization, which I will remind you was a multiyear sort of strategic initiative that we put forth a
few years ago, the growth has been tremendous, which is a real positive. So, that should help us as we think
about the recalibration of what the balance sheet looks like. Now, that said, they do come on at a higher reserve
level than what these CRE loans look like. So, as that mix shifts, there's going to mandatorily be a requirement to
increase the reserve purely of what that composition of loan looks like.

..Ira is spot on – oops, sorry, Jon, go ahead. Yeah, no, just reiterating what Ira was mentioning there. There's a

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Oh, great. I may have missed this but, Ira, beyond the adjustments you're making to your targets for 2025, do you
think this is all the adjustments that we'll likely see, meaning the CRE ratio, reserve, capital level? Anything else
that might be on the horizon beyond this or just kind of where you're thinking is more appropriate with lower rates?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
I think with everything we sort of understand now how we're thinking about the balance sheet, how we're thinking
about some of the strategic initiatives that we're putting forth, I think those intermediate targets are something that
we're very, very comfortable with and we feel very confident that we'll be able to achieve them within the
timeframe outlined.

Travis Lan A
Executive Vice President & Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. Look, I think we've seen – Chris, this is Travis. So, we've seen pretty consistent demand from the private
equity side in terms of the CRE assets that we have, and we've had those discussions as the year has gone on. I
think earlier in the year, given the backdrop at that point in time, there was just a very wide gap between what we
viewed to be the value of our portfolio versus the way a private equity investor may look at it. And as time has
gone on, that gap has obviously narrowed to a point where I think a 1% discount. We're all thrilled with the
execution there and that would include nothing on the credit side as well. It's all rate-driven. So, I think there has
been demand out there. I think we're happy to be able to execute something like this. But it's not just Valley, right?
You've seen other banking organizations execute not only loan sales, but also arrangements going forward to
help offload bank assets into the private equity markets, and that's likely to continue.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good morning. It's good to hear that the customer deposit costs are going down, that 22-basis-point reduction
that you pointed out. Can you give us some more color on what you're baking in in your 4Q NII guide in terms of
total deposit costs and especially going into 2025 as well? Because it seems like your all-in deposit beta can be a
little bit higher as you pay down those brokered deposits. So, any color on that near-term trajectory would be
great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Executive Vice President & Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Valley National Bancorp
So, Manan, I think – this is Travis. I think that's pretty insightful and we generally agree with you. So, we still bake
into the model relative to non-maturity deposits a 50% beta on interest-bearing. And when you factor in
noninterest-bearing, that goes down to 35%. We did outperform that with the first Fed rate cut. We think there are
additional opportunities to outperform that going forward, not only impacting the fourth quarter, but into 2025 as
well. And so, as we think about NII in 2025, our base case, we're still working through the plans, but the base
case would kind of be mid to high single-digit NII growth in 2025. And to the degree we can continue to
outperform from a beta perspective, you would move to the higher end of that range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q

Got it. And on NIB deposits, those were roughly flat Q-on-Q. You noted you've increased the number of accounts
you've put on as well. Do you think you're at a trough there and anything you've noticed in the underlying data that
would point to more acceleration going forward?

Travis Lan A
Executive Vice President & Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Valley National Bancorp
So, I think while they were stable, there was a slight uptick in noninterest-bearing deposits, which was the first
time we've seen that since the middle of 2022. So, if you look at this 2.5 years later, or give or take, I think it's a
very positive sign for us. On an average basis, NIB was, from a daily perspective, a little bit higher, I think, than
where it had been in the prior quarters and we continue to see that tailwind here quarter-to-date in October. So, I
think there's optimism there. We do anticipate the 22% of total deposits will be the bottom of NIB. We've been
there two quarters in a row and anticipate that it'll continue to increase relative to the total.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. And if I can just clarify the 22-basis-points reduction in deposit costs since the Fed rate cut, those are total
deposit costs including NIB?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Executive Vice President & Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yes, that's correct. So, the actual data on the interest-bearing side was higher.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
I appreciate your insights on deposit betas. Just stepping back a little bit, you kind of defined the balance sheet as
a tad asset-sensitive. And then we have an NII guide for 2025 early, albeit in the mid to high single-digit range.
Given we're in a rate-cutting environment, could you just discuss a little bit the NIM outlook and how that kind of
fits with the asset-sensitive balance sheet? It feels like the NIM should expand from here, but just wanted to hear
you clarify a little bit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, I think that's generally right. I mean, we are structurally asset-sensitive, but that assumes the lower beta in
the model and, again, our ability to outperform after the first cut. And should that continue, we'd provide additional
upside. Regardless of that, I mean, we do anticipate that the margin will continue to expand. We are, as we've
said in the past, generally neutral to the frontend of the curve, more sensitive to the longer end. And that fixed rate
asset repricing opportunity will continue to exist as 2025 – as we get into 2025 and move through the year.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2024
And on that front, I mean, the shape of the curve has definitely improved since we ran our preliminary numbers on
September 30. The 5 and 10-year points are 40 basis points to 50 basis points higher today than they would have
been at that point in time, which supports that as well. Similar to what I said on the beta side, sustainability or
improvement in those longer-term rates, I think would definitely support us getting to the higher end of that range I
laid out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Executive Vice President & Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Valley National Bancorp
And, Matt, I just want to add, I think one piece of when you look at an asset sensitivity balance sheet, you're not
looking at the rate of change as to what those assets are, right? So, when you think about the longer end
commercial real estate that we have, even though those loans are actually repricing, they're not repricing down
based on where they were originally struck at. So, those may be asset-sensitive assets that are being shown, but
they're going to reprice higher based on where those repricing rates are today versus where they were when
those loans were originated. So, there's a lot of tailwind coming on those longer commercial real estate loans and
other longer-dated loans as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Okay. The other one I had was just on the fee income guide for the fourth quarter. It suggests kind of a
flattish move from the third quarter. And the reason it stands out, it's usually the fourth quarter's strong for you
given the tax advisory business. So, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about some of the moving parts and
where you expect reductions in fee income to kind of get to the guide.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Executive Vice President & Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Valley National Bancorp
I think you're going to get tailwinds on the tax credit side and also on deposit service charges. I think it gets a little
bit offset or mitigated by some of the other income stuff that's bucketed in a single line. There can be lumpiness
there, relative to recoveries or other things that move around. So, it's generally that. And look, I think, longer-term,
there's absolute tailwinds behind us to grow fee income, but I think there were some positive events that benefited
the third quarter and just want to make sure that we're appropriately conservative heading into the fourth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
And keep in mind that on the fee income side, as we've said before, the growth for the future is really going to be
driven around our treasury management offering that we've talked about before. And then also with our lower
interest rates, we would expect that gain on sale would pick up as the resi mortgage business increases as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay, last one from me. It just feels like you're pretty well set up for operating leverage here over the next 12 to
18 months. When do you think you can get back above a 1% ROA on a sustainable basis?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A

Yeah, I think when you normalize credit and look at where the margins go, and I don't think it's that long.

Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
So, on page 4, I know these are kind of longer-term targets and you're not going to give me a detailed or finite
answer, which is fine, but when you say loan-to-deposit ratio below 100% in – by the end of 2025, I mean, when
you just kind of think hypothetical like 2026 or 2027 or whatever down the road, are we talking closer to like 90%
or 95%? Or just what would be like the optimal range? I get that you're not going to press the gas to get there, but
like where would you want this to be three years from now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, look, I think the low-90s probably makes sense on where we think we'll end up being three-ish years or so
from now. It doesn't have to be a linear path as to how we get there either. But we have a lot of initiatives
internally as to how we think about deposit growth across the organization. We've been pleased with the new
account generation that we've seen here at Valley, and we anticipate continued strong deposit growth that will
help get us to those numbers that we've identified. But I think sort of where you're describing in the low-90s
probably makes sense a few years out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got you. That's helpful. And then when you think about just the behavioral response from clients, it seems like
across the industry, with limited loan growth, it's pretty easy to price [indiscernible] (29:37). I mean, the first 100
basis points is probably the easiest [ph] hundred – or trimming (29:40) aspect. But when you kind of pivot, have
people pushed back on anything? Have you seen mix shift or any kind of frustration from the clients? Or is it just
kind of willingly taking the compression given that we're not – we don't have a huge amount of demand for loans,
so you don't really necessarily need to keep every [indiscernible] (30:02) deposit?

Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
It's funny, I think the people that are more sensitive to deposits are the analysts and our internal bankers as to
what they think the client reaction's going to end up being. I think we were very aggressive as to how we thought
about deposit repricing. That said, we've seen deposits increase even though we've been reducing balances.
That's on what you would define as direct deposit accounts from a digital perspective, as well as sort of longer-
term relationships. So, across the board, we've seen real pricing ability here. So, we are definitely optimistic about
what the future of that looks like. And once again, deposits, balances were up even though we were aggressive in
reducing rates.

Hey, good morning.

Ira D. Robbins A

Hi, Jared.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Maybe first on the loan sales, do you have the yield on – the blended yield on that portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, it was slightly above 7%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. And then when I look at the gain on sale or the gain/loss on sale of loans, what's the difference between
the loss you called out on this portfolio and what's in the income statement? Were there other loans sold as well,
and what should we expect for like sort of the pace of loan sales going forward beyond this?

Yeah, so that line in the income statement also includes our traditional gain on resi mortgage sale. That was
about $2 million this [indiscernible] (31:47) was up somewhat from the prior quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. And then in terms of the ability to or the desire to sell more of these CREs in like a – in a pool like that,
what's the appetite for additional sales?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Look, I think we've been pretty consistent on this front that we didn't feel like we had a gun to our head from a
CRE perspective or any other action that we've taken this year. So, we were patient and methodical and allowed it
to play out. And we reached a point where I think the discount was extremely attractive for us. And all it does is
help accelerate kind of the strategic progress we've been discussing on the balance sheet side. So, I don't
anticipate that there would be more CRE sales candidly, but we always monitor the environment for all of these
opportunities and are willing to do what's best for the shareholders at given point in time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay, great. Thanks. And then just finally from me on the expenses, you've had good success as the broader
expense base has been able to come down. Is there anything that when we look at technology and equipment
expense, anything that's sort of unique there? Or at what point do you need to start, I guess, maybe reinvesting in
technology or where we could see that number start to increase?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. I think we're always reinvesting in technology and other areas as to what our future looks like. We went
through a pretty significant core transformation about a year ago. And as we mentioned at that time, sometimes it
does take a while to sort of bleed through what some of those expenses are going to look like. It's not just the
immediate expense, say, with a third-party vendor, but what your internal processes look like and how you
[indiscernible] (33:34) how you service a client. So, there's always opportunities to reassess what that looks like.
I think if you go back and look at where third quarter expenses were a year ago, I think we're almost flat really on
an operating basis. And when you add in the fact that FDIC insurance is up $7 million, if you then layer in the fact
that we have a CRT trade that we didn't have before, that added a few million dollars as well. And [indiscernible]
(33:58) on an operating basis, contracted $10 million in core operating expenses just in a year. And we continue
to believe that we have opportunity to further improve the efficiency within this organization.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2024
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Elian with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. On slide 10, you called out specialized deposits at about $11 billion, which I think shows about
$1 billion growth sequentially. I think most of those segments showed growth versus the prior quarter. Can you
just talk about what's driving the recent growth specifically in the technology bucket?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, technology. I mean, we continue to have a good pipeline of companies that we bank on that side. And
progress there can be relatively lumpy, but there have been significant growth opportunities that we capitalized on
this quarter. Other commercial deposits is kind of the traditional banking that you would anticipate. Our online
account, despite the fact that we've cut the rate there a handful of times, and now have a [ph] 4.25% (35:09) rate
out there, continue to see growth in balances. So, I think it's pretty diverse and broad-based. But as we've said,
we've said now for years, so, these are the lines that are going to provide above-average deposit growth for us as
we look forward. So, you have the quarter like this where you see each of those contributors continue to grow and
I think that's generally in line with what we've been talking about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Thank you. And then my follow-up, you're guiding to low single-digits annualized loan growth in 4Q, but you call
out the mid-teens growth you saw in C&I this quarter. I guess once you get down to your CRE concentration of
[ph] 3.75 (35:45) and loan growth for the industry returns more broadly, what do you think is a more normalized
level of loan growth for the company as a whole? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
Anthony, it's Tom. I think when you look forward, it'll be in that mid-single-digit level, we'll continue to manage the
CRE concentrations through 2025. And we've experienced this C&I growth for really the five-plus years in that low
to mid-double-digit level. And our pipelines tell us that that should continue into the fourth quarter and into the
next year, but somewhat offset by what we're going to do with our CRE concentration.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 24-Oct-2024
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
On the C&I portfolio here, you guys have experienced two good quarters of growth. Just curious kind of where
you're seeing the drivers of growth and if there's any component that's either participation-driven or [ph]
international (36:53) credit?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
Oh, no. I mean, our [ph] C&I (36:58) portfolio is very small, less than 3% of our total, and we're aging on 30-plus
percent of that. So, we're not getting that through buying participations in any way. I just want to remind everyone,
and Ira said it earlier, we have experienced this level of growth for five-plus years in that low double-digit level.
And that goes back to when we started bringing in teams, emphasizing the Florida markets, and bringing in teams
of C&I lenders in Florida, and opportunistically bringing in people in the northeast, and we still do. So, a lot of this
is coming from that middle market business, banking, local, regional. It's steady growth there accelerated in
Florida versus what we're seeing in the northeast. And then the specialties, many of which we have had for years
and some of that have come through acquisitions, have added growth on top of that. But it's that continued sales
process, relationship-driven middle-market type business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay, great. And then just also noticed kind of, I know you guys have been building reserves broadly, but the C&I
bucket has always had a higher reserve. It's up 26 basis points year-over-year to [ph] 170 (38:06) as a reserve as
a percentage of loans. Just curious kind of what are the drivers for that portfolio in terms of higher reserves.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
So, within the C&I portfolio, really, at the end of the day, that portfolio as can be expected has a slightly higher
loss [ph] given default (38:28) than our CRE portfolio. That's really the primary differentiator between the end
reserve rates on that portfolio. As we've migrated throughout this past year in a higher interest rate environment,
there has been some stress on portfolio. So, on the C&I portfolio, as the CRE portfolio, there was some migration,
which contributes to that increase as well, as criticized assets carry a higher reserve than pass rated.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And to that point on criticized and classified, I think I heard the comment that the increase has moderated.
Just kind of curious, is that kind of like CRE stabilizing here and maybe the driver in the criticized is C&I, or just
kind of the dynamics there that you guys are seeing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
So, we absolutely believe that the interest rate environment has shown some easing and we anticipate that the
migration that we've seen over the past year in criticized classified assets should definitely abate, with likelihood
at some point in 2025, potentially towards the end of the year versus the beginning, that we should see some
positive migration in the portfolio.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey, just a quick follow-up. We discussed on the call expectations for kind of elevated charge-offs in the fourth
quarter. Could you just give us some sense for how lumpy that can be, what are we talking here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
So, as it relates to potential charge-offs, we have a isolated group of loans that we've been tracking that we have
our eyes on for potential losses. Not definite, there is, that we expect that there is a chance that that level could
be elevated from what we've seen, but materially not a level for the year which is out of line with anything that
we've seen at a quarter level as a percent of portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
