Thank you, Michelle. Welcome and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on today's call as we
review our first quarter results which we released before the market opened this morning. The earnings release
and accompanying investor presentation are available at columbiabank.com.
During our past few earnings calls, I've commented on our bankers remaining externally focused despite the
pandemic. They continued to show up in person and operate within the confines of a post-COVID world. Their
determination allowed us to attract new clients and deepen existing relationships. The momentum that was
building at the end of last year accelerated in the first quarter, which is typically our seasonal weakest.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2021
The core team dedicated to round two of the Paycheck Protection Program was extremely efficient, which limited
the time our bankers were not able to dedicate their full attention to supporting our clients.
As a result, excluding PPP, we achieved the first quarter record for new loan originations. We had another quarter
of impressive deposit inflows, and our financial services group revenues were a new quarterly high surpassing the
old record set just last quarter.
Our performance is the outcome of a very deliberate strategy, and focused on continuing to build our business
throughout the pandemic while at the same time ensuring the safety of our employees and clients. We activated
our well tested pandemic response plan early which gave our teams more time to shift resources in response to
changing state mandates and new federal stimulus programs.
At the same time we continue to support all of our clients ensuring that their immediate needs were met and
longer term plans could move forward. The benefits of this strategy are evident in our loan production and deposit
growth as well as in the strength of our loan pipeline. I could not be more proud of every one of our employees.
As a team we expanded relationships with clients, and each other, and improved our operating leverage while
meeting the challenges of a very unique economy. On the call with me today are Aaron Deer, our Chief Financial
Officer; Chris Merrywell, our Chief Operating Officer; and Andy McDonald, our Chief Credit Officer.
Following our prepared remarks we'll open the line and take your questions. I need to remind you that we may
make forward-looking statements during the call. For further information on forward-looking comments please
refer to either our earnings release, our website, or our SEC filings.
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Aaron.

Thanks, Clint. And good morning, everyone. During the quarter Columbia generated net income of $51.9 million
or $0.73 per share. Pre-tax, pre-provision income up $63.6 million was down $6.8 million from the fourth quarter
of 2020 primarily due to lower net interest income stemming from a combination of lower asset yields, less income
from interest recoveries and security prepayments. Compared to the first quarter of 2020 pre-tax, pre-provision
income was $4.2 million due to reduced funding costs, stronger mortgage banking activity, and lower expenses.
Total deposits end of the quarter $14.8 billion, which was an increase of $898 million from year-end. The inflows
were largely in non-interest-bearing accounts and were spread throughout our footprint. The increase is attributed
to federal stimulus including round two of PPP as well as new relationships and tempered spending and
investment by our clients. Our cost deposit dropped 1 basis point linked quarter to 4 basis points matching our all-
time low.
Total loans end of the quarter $9.7 billion, which was an increase of $249 million from year-end. First quarter loan
production was $895 million, including round two PPP production of $511 million. Loan balances excluding PPP
loans increased slightly to $8.8 billion.
New loan production excluding PPP was brought on at an average tax adjusted coupon rate of 3.70% which
compares to the overall portfolio also excluding PPP of 3.98%. The net interest margin of 3.31% was down 21
basis points on a linked quarter basis. There were a number of factors behind the drop, but the most impactful
was lower coupon rates on loans, which contributed 11 basis points to the decline. Much of the remaining drops

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2021
stem from less interest income, and the early repayment of certain CMBS, and a large interest recovery on a non-
accrual loan in the prior quarter, which together contributed about 10 basis points of pressure.
Non-interest income was down slightly in a linked quarter basis to $23.2 million or this was up $2 million from the
first quarter of 2020. The modest linked quarter decline was mostly due to seasonally lower mortgage banking
income, but we were actually pleased with how well mortgage volumes held up.
Non-interest expense of $83.6 million was down just slightly when compared both on a linked quarter and prior
year basis. Notably, our compensation expense in the first quarter benefited from the favorable impact of
capitalized origination costs for round two of PPP loans. This benefited the quarter by $5.5 million that was partly
offset by $923,000 of data processing costs for round two originations.
In addition, we recorded a $1.5 million provision for unfunded commitments. If we look for our quarterly expense
run rates return to a mid to upper 80s run rate for the remainder of the year. Provision for income taxes decreased
$4.2 million on a linked quarter basis to $16.8 million representing a 19.5% effective rate. We expect our 2021 tax
rate to be in the range of 19% to 21%.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris.

Christopher M. Merrywell
Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. We've worked hard partnering with our clients to help them and
their businesses remain viable and healthy over the past year. This has resulted in deeper relationships and
upward momentum, which is evident in the tremendous deposit flows, and strong loan production in what is
typically our seasonal low quarter. While round two PPP loan production has been a major focus, we have also
emphasized business as usual, and this approach has allowed us to win new business during a tough year, and
to create new opportunities as communities begin to exit the economic crisis. As Clint noted, excluding round two
PPP loans, we achieved a new first quarter loan production record of $384 million. This was the sixth highest
production quarter ever and follows the quarterly record of $468 million set during the fourth quarter of last year.
Loan production was offset by a decline in utilization of 2% during the quarter and 7% in the past year which was
a headwind of $92 million and $326 million respectively. The decrease is partly due to typical seasonal
agricultural pay downs, a shift in funding from existing lines to PPP loans as well as delayed investment from
uncertainty within the economy. Nonetheless we continue to be pleased with the momentum of loan production
and are optimistic with the healthy pipeline that is expected to generate quality loan production in the months to
come.
As of March 31, our round two PPP loan productions supported over 4,100 clients and we received more
applications in this round than we did in round one where we funded all qualified loan applications. We are proud
to support our communities by providing critical funding in support of both existing and new clients.
Excluding PPP, quarterly production next was 63% fixed, 33% floating, and 4% variable. Overall the portfolio mix
is now 9% PPP loans, 48% non-PPP fixed, 31% floating, and 12% variable. The composition of the loans in the
first quarter benefited from the favorable impact of – our conversation to start, portfolio remain relatively
unchanged with a small increase in C&I due to additional round two PPP loans.

Gross of unearned income, PPP loans were $915 million at the end of the first quarter. Since we opened the
forgiveness portal in mid-August, we have received over $550 million of payoffs and pay downs all related to
round one of the program.
Deposits grew by $898 million in the quarter and at an unprecedented 37% or $4 billion over the past 12 months
to $14.8 billion as of March 31. The deposit mix remained at 60% business and 40% consumer. Over half of the
increase during the quarter was in demand deposits and as of March 31st, the deposit base was evenly split
between noninterest bearing and interest bearing. We continue to drive exception rates down and as was
mentioned our cost of deposits declined to an industry leading 4 basis points.
Fee activity remained robust in the quarter with financial services and trust revenue at a new high, up 10% over
first quarter 2020. And although residential mortgage activity slowed on a linked quarter basis, it drove loan
revenue up by 61% or $2.8 million when compared to the prior year quarter. This offset declines in deposit
account fees from the increased liquidity on customer balance sheets.
At the end of March, we announced the move of our Tigard Oregon branch to a new financial hub location just like
our Ballad and Boise NeighborHubs. The Tigard financial hub will offer the same banking experience geared
towards helping our clients achieve their comprehensive financial goals including investments, trust services, and
other financial considerations. The Tigard financial hub is scheduled to open in July.
Now I will turn the call over to Andy to review our credit performance.

Andrew L. McDonald
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Chris. This quarter's ACL totaled $148.3 million, a reduction of almost $850,000 from year-end. Net
charge-offs of only $47,000 led for the provision $47,000 less than the provision release for the quarter.
Our forecast assumes annual gross domestic product to increase to 5.7% for 2021 with the unemployment rate
predicted in 2021 at 6.2%, an improvement from the 6.6% last quarter. As noted before, we use IHS Markit for our
economic forecasts. The improved forecast is counterbalanced by continued strength in the travel and leisure
industries which are showing signs of stabilizing. As I noted previously, we continue to apply and overlay this
quarter for what we consider high risk commercial real estate, and downstream potential impacts of permanent
job losses at a significant Northwest employer. These amounted to a combined $11.7 million in Q1, an increase
from $11.1 million in Q4.
Our adjustment is driven by the continuing impact of the pandemic affecting hospitality, shifting dynamics in office
and retail, and business closures and capacity restrictions in the restaurant industry. We ended the quarter with
an allowance relative to period end loans of 1.53%. Adjusting for the PPP loans, the allowance to period end
loans increases to 1.69%.
NPAs for the quarter were relatively unchanged 20 basis points. However, I always like to adjust for PPP loans as
I believe it provides a more consistent comparison as we move forward. With this adjustment, NPAs did not
increase much, only 1 basis point to 21 basis points.
Active loans for the quarter 11 basis points compared to 28 basis points last quarter. Net charge-offs as noted
earlier were essentially nil versus 13 basis points last quarter, and our impaired capital ratio was 29.4%. Problem
loans which we define as loans rated watch or worse declined from $955 million last quarter to $920 million as of
March 31, 2021. We did see migration downward from watch and special mention to substandard during the
5

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2021
quarter which also impacted our allowance for credit losses. Aviation, hospitality, and restaurants were categories
where we saw the negative migration.
Okay, deferrals. At the close of the quarter we had $71 million in active deferrals or less than 1% of our portfolio
excluding PPP loans. This is down from the $147 million in deferrals at the end of last year. Deferrals for the most
part continue to run off as expected. We continue to classify our retail, hospitality, restaurant, and aviation
portfolios as portfolios subject to an elevated level of risk due to the pandemic. In aggregate these portfolios
account for about $1.3 billion or 13.1% of our loan portfolio.
As alluded to, for the past two quarters we have removed our dental and healthcare portfolios from this
classification. Both of these portfolios exhibited stable metrics throughout 2020. Problem loans remained very
modest in this segment. There were no past dues in either portfolio and deferrals were less than $1 million or less
than 1 basis points on a combined portfolio of $1.1 billion as at quarter end.
Okay. So, for those that we still classify. Retail is the largest segment at $574 million in loans outstanding at the
end of the quarter. While we remain concerned over the pandemic impact on this portfolio, problem loans are
actually down year-over-year. We had no past dues in this segment, non-accruals are only 3 basis points, and no
retail loans were on deferral as of March 31st.
PPP loans have certainly made a difference for our borrowers in this portfolio. While these statistics are all
positive, we continue to be cautious, however, given the colloquial evidence we see in our footprint. Hospitality at
$336 million has shown a mixed bag of results. In total, problem loans in the segment declined during the quarter,
and now represent about 56% of the portfolio down from 66%.
However, we did see substandard assets increase to 26% of the portfolio from 23% at year end. There is clearly a
bifurcation in the portfolio between those which are leisure oriented and those which are business oriented.
Leisure properties have weathered the pandemic much better than our original expectations while business
oriented properties continue to struggle.
Leisure travel accounts for about 69% of our portfolio while business accounts for 31%. Restaurants which
account for about $227 million saw a modest amount of negative migration during the quarter. Problem loans
increased from 21% to 23% and criticized, classified assets increased from $29 million to $33 million. We had
about $7 million in deferrals in this portfolio at quarter end. Similar to the retail businesses, PPP loans have had a
meaningful impact for restaurant operators.
As of March 31st, 57% of our restaurant operators were at 50% occupancy. However, with rollbacks put in place
by governors in both Oregon and Washington that has dropped to 39% as of today. That demonstrating the fickle
nature of this pandemic and the economic recovery as we move forward for this industry. However, with the
summer months arriving, outdoor dining will be returning to our footprint. This combined with an increasing
number of people becoming vaccinated all bode well for the restaurant industry [indiscernible] (00:18:41).
Finally, the aviation portfolio at roughly $137 million, down by about $25 million from a year ago was relatively
stable during the quarter. As in past quarters, no long past dues, all customers continue to pay as agreed, and no
loans were on deferral. Almost all the news in this area has been positive with some airlines projecting to be cash
flow positive by the end of this quarter.
With that I'll turn the call back over to Clint.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Rulis with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.

Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Question on the margin, [ph] my date – myself here (00:20:24) on the – Clint, I recall back in the day sort of you
pegged a 4.25%, now the bank was probably half the size, and different interest rate environment, but I guess,
longer term, we've got quite a bit of liquidity, but is that a tangible mark over time to climb back to? Just trying to
kind of longer term peg a margin. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I mean there's a lot of different ways that we could respond to that. And you're right Jeff, you've been with
us for a long period of time, and throughout the history of our company, and in the different rate environments and
business cycles that has been the range that we've kind of gravitated towards.
But cash, the liquidity that's come onto our balance sheet the past year, that's really, I think, a lot of what's driving
the compression. What, I guess if I'm in your shoes, I have to think about what do I assume in terms of that
liquidity being absorbed with loan demand, the yield curve steepening, the Fed meeting this week, and this
inflation continue to, pressures continue to mount, yeah, so there's a lot of variables there.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2021
And that's why we've really been focused on growing net interest income, because we think that that's something
that our direct efforts, the production that Chris has talked about in his prepared remarks and some of the things
that Aaron and his team have done in terms of deploying that excess liquidity. I think as the business environment
normalizes, and the rate environment starts to look something like what we – what we've seen pre-pandemic and
say over the past, prior seven or eight years.
Our bankers are doing a lot of great things. And so, I think that we'll work through that liquidity and the loan-to-
deposit ratio will come up, and I think you'll start to see some margins behave in a manner that's consistent with
maybe what you've seen in prior cycles. I don't know if Aaron has anything to add.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Analyst, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, I guess, I would just add, our new loan production has a coupon of $370 million, right. So sure
there's fees to be added on top of that, but the reality is, right now the environment that we're in, that's $425
million is inconceivable. But as Clint said, we've started taking some of this liquidity to pull back on our loans. We
get a better rate environment, and absolutely, we should, at the very least, be heading back in that trajectory.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. I appreciate it, guys. I would imagine the strategy is a little more NII focused than an actual margin figure,
but I appreciate it. Maybe, if I – another big picture, Clint. I just wanted to check-in on kind of M&A. You've been
on the sidelines for a while sort of internally focused or investing in the business, and wanted to see if – if as
we've evolved here, if you've inched towards looking at any opportunities acquisition wise or it's still more lending
teams, any update on that front would be helpful. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
We've always – as we've said, M&A is in our DNA. We – in the investor deck that was updated, put out on the
website this morning, we have a standing chart, which shows our M&A history, and many of the individuals that
have been part of those – those past transactions in terms of evaluating and integration are still part of our team
today. So we still have that expertise, a lot of the work that we did over the past year, and I kind of touched on it
briefly in terms of the proactive approach that we really thought like we were able to take throughout especially
the early months of the pandemic because of our pandemic response plan that we had had in place, and the fact
that we had tested that plan, and we activated it.
And in early January of 2020 it really put us in a position to spend the back half of last year focused on continuing
to make progress on operational efficiencies, continuing to look at opportunities to grow our business and some of
those are organic. But also, we feel like that there's going to be consolidation. And I won't use the word significant
consolidation within our industry, but I just look at the rate environment, the pressures that are being faced, and I
think it's going to force some to re-evaluate and seek out a bank to partner with.
And so, our goal is to make sure that when they reach that point that we're on the short list of who they call. I can't
really get into much more detail than that. But I do think that M&A chatter is picking up and we're starting to see
some things on a national level. New announcements that have come out in the quarter. And I would expect that
you're going to see that trend continue. And you'll probably see some of that activity within our marketplace.

Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Clark with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Good morning, everyone.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hey.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I want to start on the margin as well. Can you give us the new security yields you experienced this quarter in
terms of purchases, I think it was 1.26% last quarter. Maybe start there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Sure. Yeah. With the lift in the curbs in the were longer, and with that, we did see some benefit in our new
purchases, so that number came up to about 1.46% for the first quarter. And we actually had a few purchases
that were over 2% which is the first time I saw that in a while. So things are moving in the right direction, but
obviously we've got more liquidity to deploy, and as PPP loans are forgiven, that's going to give us more liquidity
to work with. So I would expect there's more to be done on that front as you noted, it should be coming on at a
little better yield. It's not set the mix necessarily that you have but that's – but it should be positive to net interest
income.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then on the new loan coupons at $370 million I think that's up 34 basis points from last quarter, how
much of that was kind of driven by mix change or did you start to experience maybe a little bit of better pricing
given the steeper curve?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Matt, this is Chris. I'd say it's a little bit of both, and some of it depends on obviously the mix of what comes
in during the particular quarter, size of deal, credit aspect of it, and things of that nature. So, it is a bit of a moving
9


Columbia Banking System, Inc.

target. I think that the steepening of the curve certainly helps us and we'll continue to monitor and pay attention to
that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then Aaron, do you happen to have the core margin in the month of March? I guess what I'm trying to
get at is where your margin might be headed and it seems like if you just use the incremental rates on securities
and loans, maybe you're layering in some additional fees, you're kind of headed toward a kind of a 2.90-ish core
margin longer-term, but obviously remixing assets would help mitigate that to some degree. So just wondering if
you had the – if you would agree with that and if not, why, and then if you had monthly NIM in March on a core
basis that will be helpful?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
I don't have the March number in front of me. The – I would say that, 2.90% number seems a little extreme, but
[indiscernible] (00:30:58) is how long are we down in the effectively zero interest rate environment, right. So it's –
not to mention the mix changes that we just talked about. So I would say that's a more pessimistic view that I
would have, but maybe we'll see what happens with Fed and which way.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Understood. No worries. And then just on the pipeline, the loan pipeline sounds strong, can you give us kind of
order of magnitude how much it might be up linked quarter, I assume year-over-year comps are a lot easier and
less meaningful. So...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew L. McDonald A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, Matt. As far as quarter-to-quarter it continues to improve, some of that is based on what the throughput is,
how much comes through in any one quarter, I will tell you that the -- while the pipeline is strong, we certainly
have high expectations for our ability to go-to market and the things we can do and we're not disappointed. And
so, I think that we're seeing our approach over the second half of -- certainly the second half by 2020 is certainly
paying dividends, we're seeing more opportunities.
Our approach with the second round of PPP is paying dividends on new relationships. And so, we're getting
plenty of [indiscernible] (00:32:32) and then it all comes down to structure and pricing and things of that nature.
But, we're very pleased with where we're at, and we'll see how the – if we get any rollbacks here in the pandemic,
and how that might affect things, but it appears that people are getting back and engaged, taking advantage of a
low interest rate environment, but also actively investing in their businesses which is all of it [indiscernible]
(00:32:58).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then just on the PPP related stuff, the FAS 91 benefit this quarter, I think in the release, you most of
the declining comp was related to that. But can you quantify the dollar number there. And then, can you also just
confirm how much you have in the way of round one PPP net fees left in round two net PPP fees and the
amortization schedule too.

Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Sure. So, yeah the FAS 91 related to PPP was about $5.5 million, I'd also point out that we had some technology
fees related to PPP, that was about $900,000. And the other kind of material item in the quarter was we recorded
a $1.59 million provision for unfunded commitments. But as far as you think about each of those, and what that
looks like going forward as you're modeling that.
Also going forward, we tend to have a big lift in FICO and 401(k) contributions in the first quarter some of which
will go away, and as we head into the second quarter, and through the year. The – in terms of the remaining
unearned income related to PPP that's about just shy of $21 million at March 31st.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
And how much of that came from round two just so we can amortize that over some five years? How much you're
assuming something different?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
So, yeah, I guess if you were to assume the straight line amortization then, yeah, five years, so although I
wouldn't think about it that way myself. But the – that there was – yeah, let me put in this way, so at this – at
yearend, we had $9.9 million in unearned income, and of that amount, related to PPP one, we had $4.4 million
remaining at March 31, so that should give you a sense of how much we added during the first quarter with round
two.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Got it. [indiscernible] (00:35:25), I just want to make sure I heard you correctly said $5.5 million of
originated deferred fees.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Good morning.

David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
I wanted to start on the record non-PPP production for first quarter. I'm just curious where the growth came from.
How much do you think is kind of from an improved economic outlook just giving your clients more confidence in
investing versus new client acquisition from the PPP program or the new hires, and maybe just kind of whether
we started to see any real contribution from the neighborhood comps at all?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
David I'll just start with a statement, and then I'll step back, and let Chris actually give you some numbers for
context. But pre-pandemic the biggest single comment that we would hear from our clients was they could grow
their business 20%, 30% or more, but labor was a constraint for them, they just simply couldn't find enough labor
or the right skillset of available labor.
And then I would say, the conversation with the clients that I've been in contact with has returned to that dynamic.
There's going to be pockets, as Andy talked about, the hospitality sector and things, but a lot of our business
clients are very, very busy. And they just simply can't get enough people to continue to keep up with all the
opportunities that they have in front of them.
So I do think there's a lot of optimism out there. We do feel like the PPP has helped thousands of businesses
within our market area. But also there's a lot of liquidity that's still there. And the other thing that I don't know that
we really have spent any time talking about is the disruption in supply chain. So things like the chip shortage, and
how that ripples through, and not necessarily directly with our clients. But in terms of things they're investing. If
they're looking for a new piece of machinery or something, and if that production is idled or delayed because they
simply can't get the chips to manage the electronic components, so I think those are some of the things that will
start to break loose as we go forward, and will create additional opportunities for our industry, and for us, and for
the clients. So I'll step back and let Chris add his context.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Actually, I don't have the exact numbers on the mix on that. But I can tell you that it's pretty well diversified. It's
coming from all over the footprint. It's coming from all of the concepts or the efforts that you've talked. Probably,
most notably picking up business because of the approach of being open where we're taking advantage of
situations where other institutions have closed locations and clients are migrating because of that approach.
And as far as the NeighborHub, both NeighborHubs that we currently have, they certainly support our commercial
banking opportunities, and they're performing at or above expectations, but they're really more of their support to
what's happening. They do drive some small business production certainly and but the bigger benefit is, is how
they support the overall network and support our – support our bankers in total.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. That's good color. And then just kind of following up on your comments coming on the supply chain; I'm just
curious what you guys are seeing on the C&I side. It sounds utilizations have continued to come down, but do you
think we've hit a trough yet, I guess just as clients start needing to build inventory, and this improved economic

outlook; do you think that we're kind of at trough levels here, or I guess, as you talk to clients do you think they'd
prefer to use their excess cash before starting to draw lines? Just curious what your thoughts are there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well, I'll start with first quarter is historically our seasonal trough, and where we end up, and where that picks up
sometimes just depends on, do we have an early spring or late spring and in particular with some of our cultural
clients. And we've had a late spring. Everything here seems to be about five weeks sometimes where we typically
would be in terms of weather conditions and while spring is – spring is fine. We did have a stretch of 80 degree
weather followed by stretch of 48 in rain. But today it's sunny and so definitely starting to see that seasonal –
seasonally driven activity pick up. There's other components in terms of the C&I book, it also leads to demand
besides your comment around clients using their own liquidity, but into different business verticals that we're in
sometimes as their markets heat up or cool down, their line utilization also changes.
So, I'm optimistic about your comment about is this the bottom or the trough, but it's not a typical year, we're still
in the last – well I hope, I the last grips of the pandemic, as vaccination rates improve, and things, as Andy
mentioned, various counties within our footprint have sort of backslid or on the cusp of backsliding into various
components of restrictions not like what we saw at this time a year ago, but certainly it is – it's just matter of data
points that cause us to pause, and say, the second quarter is not going to be necessarily the same [indiscernible]
(00:42:59) seasonal activity in the past might have been outside of some of those things that are very much
driven by the weather and the time of year that it is. And with that, I'll pass it to Chris, I think you would like to add.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
What I would add to that is I think that where we're at is somewhat unprecedented. And so, thinking forward of –
are we at or near a trough is probably, it's what we're all looking towards, it's what we're optimistic that those
things start to change. There's a lot of liquidity still on the sidelines. I am optimistic that we're starting to see some
of that liquidity be invested into traditional securities markets, and I think that's shown in the results that we're
seeing in our financial services and trust division of – some of that money is now moving to other areas starting to
look for additional yield or return on it.
I think the piece around, right now, for liquidity, if you're certainly sitting on lots of cash at a low interest rate, it
certainly makes sense to pay down your line. But as we start picking up on our production and we're seeing that
fixed production once that kind of starts working through the system, you'll start seeing some more opportunistic
types of things as we exit the pandemic. And then, of course, I would just echo and reiterate that the late spring
certainly has an impact.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. That's good color. And then, look, the key really to getting back -- the margin back to where we've talked
about is putting on new earning assets. It's great to hear the increase in the rates on new production. I'm just
curious whether you're interested or are you increasingly willing to be competitive on rate in order to drive growth
or do you think you can hold the line on rate and still drive the growth that you need to deploy that liquidity. And
conversely, is there any appetite for some potential loan purchases to supplement that before liquidity quicker.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2021
David I could talk about the production side and I'll let Aaron to the second part of that question. If we're given a
choice, I would much rather – and we would much rather compete on rate than on structure. And certainly that is
a long term aspect of who we are, and what we would do. I think that several things are at play there. Our value
proposition around relationships, doing more than a simple transaction, and our process, and ability that we
stayed open can certainly help in some situations drive a little higher yield, a little higher coupon. But it all
depends on the relationship.
And as long as we continue to show value and bring other things to the table, we can't command a bit higher
coupon on that. Now with that said, I will also say there's some very competitive opportunities out there and we'll
look at all of those from a credit aspect first and if it passes through that aspect, then we will sharpen our pencil if
necessary, if it makes sense, if it's right in our backyard, and things of that nature, and so we will compete on
price selectively, it's probably the best way to say.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Analyst, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
And in terms of loan purchase, I mean obviously we – our preferences to use our mining teams to drive around
organic production which is a fantastic track record and I think we're growing really optimistic about where things
are moving going forward. We've played – we've very selectively made several examples of mortgage purchases
or something like that to kind of backfill pay downs or something in that book when our own production isn't quite
matching what we want to carry on the balance sheet. But ideally what we're going to do is drive our own
originations and loan growth. And if something came along that seemed particularly attractive, yeah, we'll take a
look, but buying lines of big premiums right now doesn't necessarily make a lot of sense to me.

A couple of cleanup questions here. Just on the loan production numbers, it feels like you're saying this, and your
peers are kind of saying this as well that economic activity is picking up, but it's not quite there yet. And I'm just
curious, some of your earlier comments about your bankers are less burdened with PPP now and they're looking

forward. And I guess the big picture question is are you just taking share in terms of your production or is this
increased economic activity that's driving this?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Jon, it's Chris. I would tell you it's both. Economic activity is certainly starting to increase. But as you mentioned, it
is – it is not where it was in 2019. I think the fact that we opened forgiveness back in August of last year, and have
moved considerably through the first round bodes really well for, and our approach in the second round with the
technology that we had available was pretty seamless. And so it was a much easier process for us. We expect to
see that on the backside of the second round PPP forgiveness as well.
And so that has really kept our bankers from working on that and being all hands on debt. We've got a very
streamlined process still requires people, but nowhere near as many is as what we experienced last year. And so
our teams are out and about capitalizing on the opportunities in the markets. And it would tell you that's broad
based. It's all three states. It's all of our regions. And there's a real sense of – now is the great time for us to be
out and talking about our approach. And again being open has paid fantastic dividends. And the teams are
excited. So they're out and about trying to win business so that leads to your part of – yeah, there were some
share that's been acquired.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Andy a question for you, how concerned are about deterioration in some of the stressed sectors, and that
leading into higher nonperformance. I mean your numbers are booked for every coin but I'm just curious on your
thoughts on that topic?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew L. McDonald A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well. I'm obviously surprised at how well all of the segments that we've identified have performed. So hospitality
would be the first one that I have concerns with in terms of migration into non-performing assets. And that would
be that business traveler segment that I talked about before. If we look historically we can see the business travel
takes for an extended period of time relative to leisure to rebound. So that will be the area that I have concern.
The retail and restaurants continues to just surprise me. As I mentioned before, retail credit down than it was a
year ago, and restaurants relatively speaking I guess it's meeting expectations that they're not deteriorating into a
non-performing loans yet.
But why I would put hospitality first, I said the appropriate restaurants next. So those will be the two segments that
I think we will see some migration into non-accruals and ultimately there could be a modest amount of charge-offs
there as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And then I guess this is another bigger picture question. But just on the reserve level, [indiscernible]
(00:52:15) CECL I think it was maybe a little above 1%. And I know that there's plenty of stuff to be concerned
about. But can you migrate back there over time? Is that the right level to think about longer-term?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 29-Apr-2021
Yeah, I think that with CECL it's difficult to say where that migrates longer-term. I think in terms of our behavior for
this year, it's pretty consistent with what I've talked about before and where it's going to kind of bounce around a
little bit. And we'll have some modest relief as we continue to move forward. I certainly think that you're going to
see it migrate down. It's just really difficult with a new model to say 1% is the long-term given the volatility of
economic forecast.
Now as we continue to get more stable economic forecast and in this case where it's stable to slightly improving,
we are seeing that the model behaves in a more stable manner. And to that extent, yes, you would have the
ability to migrate down into one of the quarter, and possibly one, if you continue to have that stable economic
forecast.

Hi, everyone. Good morning.

Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hi Jackie.
<Q – [06P884-E]Jackie Bohlen – Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.> Wanted to start on capital, you obviously have
really healthy levels, I just wanted to get a refresher on how you're thinking about the – I know you used to do a
variable special dividend. So, if that comes up in conversation, and I'm guessing lower appetite for buyback there,
but just an update would be great.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. We still haven't changed our view on – in terms of our long-term targets, and for many years, we've stated
that TCE of 8% and total capital ratio of 12% is kind of what we think makes sense for us in terms of giving us
flexibility to do some things opportunisticly. And we are well above those levels. But I think that as we progress
through, and through 2021 some of the conversations that we'll have with our with our board of directors will be
around the direction those ratios continue to accept or continue to build, and what uses or what tools do we have
available to us to start to shift those closer to those long-term targets.
And there are some things on the horizon that obviously has maintained our regular dividend as you noted special
dividends have been a tool that we've used many times over the years in that regard. And so, I wouldn't – I
wouldn't rule that out. Buybacks, we have an authorization in place, but we'll be opportunistic, and use discretion
in terms of to the extent that we engage in buybacks. There's also as we talked earlier, and I think it was in
response to Jeff's question and my comments around, we do expect that the M&A activity in our region will pick
up at some point in the coming year. And so, I guess it's a long winded way of saying that our traditional uses of
capital are still on the table, but that knowing what we know today we're comfortable being above those long-term
targets.

Jacquelynne Bohlen Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then, just thinking about M&A, I feel like we're in a really fluid environment with a lot of moving pieces.
So, just a refresh on how you think about potential targets in terms of size and geography would be great.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Not yet, yeah. I'm not going to give you the playbook.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jacquelynne Bohlen Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
The ticket would be great, Clint, if you could just do that. Just broadly, I'm trying to get at it if you would look at
something. You're obviously much larger than you were when you were doing deals in the past. And so, I'm trying
to get out to the extent that you're not able to that there's not an available target that really moves the needle for
you if you would take a look at something strategic, but small.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. That's the exact word that I would use and that I had on the tip of my tongue is this – the strategic rationale.
That's when we only talk about M&A internally. That's the question we always ask is what's the strategic rationale,
does it make sense. What does it bring to us that we don't have, how is it additive to our franchise and not diluted
to what we've built over the last 28 years. And we tend to think about it more along those volumes as opposed to
absolute size. There's, I mean, you've seen our growth and in terms of deposits over the past quarter, and the
past year, and so it'd be easy to say [indiscernible] (00:58:21) there's this minimum size where we just would even
consider M&A because our or organic growth just outpaces or we could do it over a certain time horizon. But I
think that's a little shortsighted and needlessly confines the institution to thinking about that strategic rationale and
there's things whether it's a tech platform whether it's a certain niche expertise that we could gather from it. And
but all things being equal, it does have – it does take a larger target to move the needle than what it did for us,
say 10 years ago, or pre-Great Recession. So I don't know if that's helpful for you but that's kind of how we think
about it.

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Terrell Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey, so I wanted to ask just on the deposit growth front. So we obviously saw a tremendous amount of deposit
growth this past quarter. It's impressive to see non-interest-bearing mix still being so high. I was hoping you could
speak to just any kind of early trends you're seeing in the month of April just in terms of deposit flows. Does it feel
like things are slowing down with less stimulus being put into the economy? Can you maybe just update us on
how you're thinking about deposit growth throughout the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
So I guess this is the theme of the day. I'll start, and then let Chris and Aaron add some comments. In respect to
the question around line utilization I talked about the seasonality, and that's something that we also have
seasonality historically in our deposit portfolio. And typically the first half of the year in any given year, we have
little or very little deposit growth or sometimes we actually go backwards, and then much of our deposit growth will
occur in the third and fourth quarters.
And – so for us to have a quarter like what we had last – this past quarter is definitely an outlier from our historical
seasonality that we would experience. I don't have a crystal ball to necessarily know where we'll be when we talk
after the second quarter, here in July. But I can certainly say that the first quarter performance was definitely a
dramatic departure from what our historical expectations would be for the first quarter or second quarter. And with
that I'll step back, and give Chris, I don't have anything I'd like to add.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
[indiscernible] (01:01:42) what I'd add to it is, if you take in consideration the amount of the growth, and then you
take in that again our investment teams had record production in the first quarter, there's a lot of money moving
throughout the system. And even with that production went into our investment teams, we still had the deposit
growth. And so, I think it's driven from a few sources, and then obviously PPP is part of it.
There's also a lot of businesses within our regions that are doing phenomenally well, and they continue to deposit
their money as well. And so, I think as people start moving to the second quarter, travel starts picking up, and
things of that nature. We've seen travel pick up, hasn't had a major impact in the first quarter. We'll see how that
kind of moves out throughout the second quarter into the summer. You may see some of that, that liquidity start
being deployed. Now typically what seems to take place is our client may deploy the liquidity, but also somebody
else's clients deploying the liquidity and it ends up in one of our business accounts.
And so a little bit of movement around in how the money – how the money is changing hands, and I think until you
start finding ways that liquidity leaves the system, this maybe a little bit of an abnormal year for us especially in
the first half. But again, we're seeing more money be deployed into investment assets and things of that nature,
but it hasn't had a tremendous impact yet.

Okay. That's very helpful. And then maybe Aaron, do you have how much in PPP income is included in the loan
fee disclosure that's made at the bottom of the margin detail in the release? I think the total loan fee dollar was
$8.3 million.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Analyst, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
So in the first quarter, we – on our PPP program, we had earned an interest of just over $2 million. We had fees
of a little shy of $3 million and then we had accelerated fees a little over $4 million. So all in, you're looking at
about $9 million, and the PPP loan yield in the quarter was 4.46%.
