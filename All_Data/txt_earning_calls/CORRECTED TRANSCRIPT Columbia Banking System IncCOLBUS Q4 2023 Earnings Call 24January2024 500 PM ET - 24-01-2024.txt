Senior Vice President & Investor Relations Director, Umpqua Bank
Thank you, Valerie. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us as we review our fourth quarter 2023
results, which we released shortly after the market closed today. The earnings release and corresponding
presentation, which we will refer to during our remarks this afternoon, are available on our website at
columbiabankingsystem.com.

Tory Nixon, the Presidents of Umpqua Bank; Ron Farnsworth Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Namdar, our
Chief Credit Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will take your questions.
During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and are
intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. For a list of factors that may cause
actual results to differ materially from expectations, please refer to slide 2 of our earnings presentation as well as
the disclosures contained within our SEC filings. We will also reference non-GAAP financial measures alongside
our discussion of GAAP results. We encourage you to review the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations provided in
our earnings release and throughout the earnings presentation.
I will now turn the call over to Clint.

Clint E. Stein
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Jacque. Good afternoon, everyone. 2023 was a tremendous year for Columbia. We closed and
integrated our transformational merger with Umpqua Bank, expanding our footprint to encompass eight Western
states and creating one of the largest banks headquartered in the West. We achieved targeted net cost savings
ahead of schedule and 6% above our original projections, even after taking franchise reinvestment into account.
With the integration behind us, our priorities in 2024 and beyond have shifted to focus more fully on optimizing
performance and driving shareholder value. The fourth quarter was noisy and our results reflect that. The FDIC
special assessment and other elevated expense items brought our quarterly expense run rate above prior
guidance.
Our cost of funds reflects the rate environment and the associated impacts of repricing CDs and higher-priced
funding sources like public deposits and brokered funds. While these items mask the quality of our core deposit
base, they do not dilute it.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2024
Relationship banking drives our franchise value, and it's the value proposition we bring to new and existing
customers. Our fourth quarter results do not reflect this value and we were focused on improving controllable
variables to offset macro-driven headwinds.
Looking to the year ahead, the competitive environment for deposits and impact of higher rates is likely to persist,
and the macro credit environment will likely normalize at minimum. We were well situated to benefit during times
of stress should they emerge. Our talented associates, scaled franchise and offerings, and customer-focused
business model provide us with the resources to win business and long-term drive consistent, repeatable
performance.
I'll now turn the call over to Ron.

Ronald L. Farnsworth
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Okay. Thank you, Clint. And for those on the call who want to follow along, I will be referring to certain page
numbers from our earnings presentation.
Slide 4 lays out our Q4 performance ratios, knowing the decline in the quarter was driven primarily by the decline
in non-interest-bearing demand deposits as customers continue to utilize cash, higher provision for credit loss
based on slightly worsening economic forecasts and higher expense, including in the FDIC special assessment.
These are five-quarter views and recall we closed the combination at the end of February.
Slide 5 shows our summary balance sheet, noting our deposits in total were flat from Q3 given seasonal inflows
primarily on public deposits, mostly offset customers' use of cash. Our tangible book value is up 13% as our
accumulated other comprehensive loss was halved during the quarter as bond markets rallied.
On slide 6, we highlight the income statement trends. GAAP earnings were $0.45 per share, impacted by decline
in merger expense as we completed the integration, along with fair value changes due to market yield changes.
On an operating basis, we earned $0.44 per share in Q4, lower than expectations again given non-interest
bearing deposit flows, higher costs on interest-bearing deposits, and an increased provision with slightly worse
economic forecasts and higher expense given â€“ driven primarily by the FDIC special assessment, which at $33
million reduced GAAP and operating EPS by $0.12 per share.
Turning to slide 7, we break out Q4 GAAP earnings to help investors understand the non-operating and merger-
related impacts on results. The first column represents our Q4 GAAP results, with net income of $94 million or
$0.45 per diluted share and return on tangible common equity of 12%.
The second column includes our non-operating designation for income statement changes mostly related to fair
value swings, along with merger and exit and disposal costs included in non-interest expense, which are detailed
out in the appendix. This net the $2 million of income in Q4 earnings, resulting in a third column for operating
income.
Again, our operating income for Q4 was $91 million or $0.44 per share, and results were impacted by the FDIC
special assessment and reserve build given again slightly worsening economic forecasts.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2024
The appendix shows trending on each of these columns, and the fourth column includes discount accretion and
CDI amortization, noting this discount accretion will be a steady and reliable source of interest income over time
as the majority is driven by rate, not credit, providing us with a steady build of capital over time.
And recall, the CDI amortization does not impact tangible book value so the $0.13 per share net for merger
accounting was the equivalent of $0.25 per share added to tangible book value in Q4. We'll continue to highlight
and trend it here to investors and valuing all our earnings streams. Our tangible book value excluding AOCI
increased $0.27 during the quarter to $17.35 per share.
Moving to the next section on slide 9, we highlight net interest income and margin. Our NIM declined to 3.78% for
the quarter driven primarily by a higher cost of interest-bearing deposits more than offsetting increased loan yields
and lower costs from term debt. Slide 10 breaks out the repricing and maturity characteristics of the loan portfolio
noting 41% is fixed, 30% is floating, and 29% are adjustable.
Now slide 11 provides an updated view of our interest rate sensitivity under both ramp and shock scenarios.
We've taken proactive measures to reduce the balance sheet sensitivity to a future declining rate environment.
You can see here the trending over the past year, where our rates down risk has been reduced significantly, and
note that below we calculate our cycle to date funding betas, which are calculated on a combined company basis
over the periods presented for comparability.
As of the fourth quarter, our interest-bearing deposit portfolio has priced in 47% of the Fed funds rate increases.
Notable here is the cost of interest-bearing deposits which was 2.54% for Q4 and 2.71% for the month of
December. The lift this quarter was influenced by several factors. The decision in Q3 to replace a maturing
Federal Home Loan Bank advances for broker deposits was essentially neutral to the cost of interest-bearing
liabilities, but it drove nearly 30% of the increase in interest-bearing deposit cost between Q3 and Q4.
Approximately 15% of the quarter's increase relates to an increase in the average balance and rate paid on public
deposits and approximately $900 million in customer CDs with largely 12- and 13-month terms matured during the
quarter, with many repricing upwards of 200 basis points higher. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities normalizes
for balance sheet management decisions and the quarter's 30-basis-point increase was significantly lower than
the increase in interest-bearing deposit costs. Cost from interest-bearing liabilities was 3.02% in Q4 compared to
3.15% for the month of December and 3.19% as of December 31.
Slide 12 breaks out non-interest income items wherein the largest changes in Q4 relate to interest-rate driven line
items. The changes in loans held at fair value at the bottom was a direct result of decrease in long-term yields this
quarter. Next up on slide 13, we note we achieved the $143 million in cost synergies guided last quarter,
exceeding our original target of $135 million by 6%. This amount is net of reinvestments made in various areas.
While we will continue to target efficiency improvements with the integration now largely complete, we no longer
consider future cost-saving opportunities to be merger related. Q4 expense was above our previously guided
range due to several elevated expense items noted on the right side of the waterfall from the prior quarter, with
increases driven by higher repairs and maintenance, equipment purchases, a branding campaign, and most
notably, the $33 million FDIC special assessment.
On slide 14, we introduce our outlook for 2024 on several key financial statement items. Our net interest margin
remains sensitive to customer deposit balances, with growth driving margin stability and perhaps expansion as we
replace wholesale funding and outflows driving contraction. Our interest rate outlook which incorporates three rate
cuts in the back half of the year does not meaningfully impact prepayment assumptions related to purchase

accounting. Our expense outlook incorporates a low single-digit level of growth from Q4's adjusted run rate. We
see areas for efficiency improvement to offset the costs associated with franchise reinvestment and inflation. To
that end, we consolidated five branches this month.
Moving ahead to the next section on the balance sheet on slide 16, we detail out the investment portfolio. The
table takes you from current par to amortized cost to fair value, noting the difference between current par and
amortized cost as a combined net discount which will be accreted to interest income over time. The increase in
market value this quarter, of course, resulted from lower market yields given the bond market rally, again with the
unrealized loss halving.
Just over half of the portfolio is now sitting with an unrealized gain at year end, which gives us significant flexibility
to manage the balance sheet moving forward. As you can tell, I'm excited about this portfolio as it gives us
significantly higher and stable earnings stream with greater optionality. The overall book yield was 3.59% with an
effective duration of 5.4 years at quarter end.
Slide 17 covers our liquidity including deposit flows during the quarter. Total deposits were essentially flat in the
fourth quarter. Seasonal and targeted increases in public deposits nearly offset contraction in small business
balances, as other categories were relatively unchanged. The upper right table details our off-balance sheet
liquidity, with $11.7 billion available as of quarter-end. Below that, we had cash in excess bond collateral now
pledged for lines to arrive at total available liquidity of $18.7 billion. Slide 18 provides the driver of 3% annualized
loan growth in Q4.
Turning now to slide 19, we present the remaining balance of discount marks as compared to the prior quarter
and at closing. For the AFS portfolio, the acquired discount was reduced $21 million via the accretion to interest
income. In our earnings release detail, we include this $21 million, along with $16 million of higher bond interest
income and the portfolio restructure we completed post-close to arrive at the $37 million of total accretion for
bonds. On the loan side, we had $27 million of rate accretion, $5.4 million for credit. The total marks declined $69
million in Q4 through accretion to interest income.
And finally, in the back on slide 26, we highlight our regulatory capital position and our risk-based capital ratios
increased 20 basis points as expected in Q4. We do expect to quickly approach our long-term capital target of
12% on total risk-based capital, which will provide for enhanced flexibility to return excess capital to shareholders.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Frank.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank D. Namdar
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Ron. Slides 20 through 22 provide select characteristics of our loan portfolio, including composition of
our commercial book and an overview of our office portfolio which continues to perform well.
Moving on, slide 23 highlights our reserve coverage by loan category. Also, the remaining credit discount on loans
provides for an additional 21 basis points of loss absorbing capacity. The $55 million provision expense recorded
in the quarter was primarily driven by a slight worsening in the economic forecast used in the credit models, along
with credit migration. Delinquency and non-performing loan movements over the past two quarters suggest a
move toward a more standard credit environment following a phase of exceptional high quality.
Slide 24 provides an overview of our consolidated credit trends. In general, our credit performance is and has
remained positive, excluding the anticipated trend in FinPac. FinPac charge-offs remain elevated during the fourth

quarter, still centered in the trucking portion of the portfolio. We continue to expect a slow recovery timeline over
multiple quarters for this portfolio. Excluding FinPac charge-off activity at the bank remains at a low level.
I will now turn the call over to Tory.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Frank. Turning to deposits, slide 25 highlights the quality of our granular deposit base. As Ron noted,
small businesses use of cash drove a reduction in customer deposits during the fourth quarter as other
commercial balances and consumer accounts were relatively stable in aggregate. The fourth quarter included
normal course of business, use of cash like distributions, dividends, and year-end tax payments, while public
balances experienced a related increase. Public deposits were positively impacted by targeted efforts by our
teams to grow public relationships and local communities as we work to reduce wholesale funding balances. Our
teams remain focused on driving balanced growth in deposits, loans and core fee income as they work to expand
existing relationships throughout the bank, bringing new prospects into the bank.
We see tremendous opportunity with our existing customer base to grow fee income. We launched Smart Leads
in 2020 as a way to capture additional business with our existing customer base through predictive analytics. We
generated an additional $11 million in revenue since 2020, with $5 million generated in 2023 alone, highlighting
increased traction with our teams and the benefits of our scaled organization. We will continue to selectively
invest in talent, technology and locations that enable us to profitably expand our businesses as the efficiency
opportunities, Ron noted, maintain our dedication to growing in a cost effective manner. And lastly, our loan
deposit and core fee income pipelines remain robust.
I will now turn the call back over to Clint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Okay. Thanks, Tory. Our regulatory capital position is outlined on slide 26. And as Ron discussed, we expect
capital to continue to accrete quickly in the coming quarters, providing us with ample flexibility for future
shareholder return. This concludes our prepared comments, and our team is available to answer your questions.
So, Valerie, please open the call for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment for our first question. Our first question comes from
the line of David Feaster, Raymond James. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey, good afternoon, everybody.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hey, David.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
I appreciate all the guidance. And maybe just talking about starting on the margin and digging into the some of the
impacts of rate cuts. I'm curious how you think about the NIM trajectory. Obviously, you guys include three cuts in
your forecast. How do you think about the impact of cuts you guys have ma â€“ have done a great job managing
the downside in the rate sensitivity scenarios. I'm just curious how you think about the trajectory and of the margin
and how quickly you'll be able to reprice some of those core deposits on the way down?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. David, hey, this is Ron. Great question. As I look into 2024, I mean, if that were to come true and we see
three rate cuts in the back half of the year or X number of rate changes as the market is predicting. Really key
with that, [ph] if I mean (00:18:25), what happens to the deposit betas and then those rates down scenarios I think
we're pretty conservative in these numbers with betas in the low to mid-30% range. Whereas on the rates up side,
we're now at 47% and we model 53%, 54% on rates up. So something tells me you're going to see most banks
probably be north of their model results on the rates down side, just given nature and the fact that deposit moved
up so quickly. So with that, it would suggest that there could be potential upside on it. But again, under all of it is
going to be what's going on with underlying customer deposit flows, right, so that's still the main driver versus
betas, I would suggest.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
President-Consumer Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
[indiscernible] (00:19:04) And David, this is Chris. I'll add to the rate part of that discussion that between Tory,
myself and our teams, we were already looking at the competitive market. We're looking at where rates are
trending I think you'll start to see us start moving potentially ahead of any sort of rate cut scenario and putting in
place the long-term kind of more plan of if we get a rate cut and pick your month, what are we planning to do? So
all of that's being laid out right now and we should be launching that relatively soon here. But yeah, just trying to
get ahead of that aspect of it and I think you see the market is already kind of moving in that direction. So it'll just
be a matter of historically, can we follow or can we lead as we've done in the past and that would be the ideal
situation.

David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And maybe kind of just a follow-up to some of this. Just staying on the deposit side, in the
prepared remarks, it was alluded to some of the decline is being attributed to small business declines. I'm curious
maybe what are some of the drivers of that from your standpoint? Obviously, there's some seasonality, but how
much of it's activating deposits versus paying down debt, using cash to fund growth or just less profitability at this
point for some of the small businesses? And just curious, it's early in the first quarter. Just curious, how â€“ are you
seeing things stabilize and how do you think about core deposit growth going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
President-Consumer Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, you got a lot in there, David. I would say the uses that you mentioned, absolutely you're seeing that
completely across the board. You are seeing some small businesses that good operators have the ability to
increase their prices and things of that nature. But for many of them, inflation is certainly taking a big impact. And
that goes across all items from products to service to the employment inputs and things of that nature. We move
into really kind of more of a seasonality type of situation in the first quarter as well. I would say we're in contact
with the small business customers through our local presence, mainly through the branches. People are positive,
but [ph] they're also would say (00:21:28) looking down the road for when something's going to take place that's
going to provide them some relief. We haven't seen that quite yet. And I think Tory can speak to a little bit more
on the commercial side there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. David, it's Tory. On the commercial side, it's pretty kind of typical with the end of the year in Q4. The one
difference is you saw people that took â€“ they take excess cash that they have in their operating accounts and
want to reposition that into some interest bearing account. Just with kind of a good course of business on their
point â€“ from their standpoint. But, it's a typical use of cash, of dividends, distributions, tax payments, those types
of things, investments, [ph] at (00:22:13) some customers are making investments and doing it with cash instead
of borrowing for it. So kind of some typical stuff that we've seen in the last year or so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
President-Consumer Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. And [ph] David, same (00:22:24). Tory and I talked quite a bit about the momentum that's building and our
teams getting excited about being out in the market integrations behind them. And we're seeing new business
start to come on with some of the other things that are going on out there now. It's coming on at a higher cost than
we've seen in the past. But we're driving those operating accounts, we're getting the full relationships with the
focus. And we say Tory and myself, see stories almost every day about somebody somewhere in the footprint,
bringing in a new name into the bank.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
That's great. That's great. And I guess to that point, I'm curious on the C&I growth, curious, where are you having
success driving growth? How much of it's from client acquisition versus increased utilization or deeper
relationships or even the new hires that you've made. I'm just curious your appetite for growth and whether you'd
expect the C&I to be the key driver of loan growth going forward?

Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. David, it's Tory again, definitely C&I growth as the place that we will grow the lending side of the house with
full relationship banking. So like we said, I think very consistently, we're in eight western states, great markets,
we've got great people, they have very strong pipelines. We saw C&I growth, kind of a mixture between new client
acquisition, as Chris was talking about, plus lending to existing customers, doing their normal course of business.
So it was spread throughout the footprint, so there's not one place where I can say we got most of our growth. It
was kind of spread throughout our footprint. And as Chris said, I mean, we feel very good about the pipelines and
the activity that's occurring out in the field so.

Operator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line Timur Braziler of Wells
Fargo. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi, good afternoon. Following-up on the net interest income, net interest margin commentary, just with the
expectation for deposits and funding to remain a source of pressure here in the near-term. And then the
expectation for rate cuts in the back end of the year, is there an outcome where NII inflects and grows in 2024 or
is that more likely a 2025 event?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well, Timur, this is Ron. Good question. And again, it's going to be really a function of the cost of that deposit
growth. I could definitely see a scenario where you see a little on the lower end and front end if we do continue to
see pressure on non-interest bearing demand specifically within that guide range. But then once they start
moving, again, I talked about earlier that deposit beta, I think that's pretty conservative. And I would suggest
unless the regional banks think the model betas on the rates downside. They're going to be close to what they
were on the upside. So you could see a scenario exactly where you get some pickup in the second half.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then I guess looking at the deposit costs and some of the December 31 spot rates, is that a good
ceiling here? Is that kind of where we expect the funding-based to stall out or is there going to be some more mix
10

shift in the first half of the year to some of these higher cost categories, like which could keep that lag around and
costs for a little bit longer?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, obviously, it's an estimate, but we would expect the lag to continue there and that's probably why we show
the 47% beta to-date, [ph] but we model over (00:26:18) 53% on the rates up side. So you got that additional
piece. We also have â€“ in this past quarter, we had about $900 million of CDs repricing that 12 to 13-month tenor.
So they have been sitting there for a year and those all repriced up close to 200 basis points in the first quarter. I
want to say it's around $650 million to $700 million of CDs maturing, which will reprice but will be less than 200
basis points that just given the timing of those compared to when the Fed was raising rates earlier in 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And I guess what's the thought process or the rationale for maintaining all of those balances rather than
being more aggressive with rates here and letting some of that money walk?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Just overall liquidity levels where we feel comfortable sitting with cash on the balance sheet [indiscernible]
(00:27:05) at the Fed. And keep in mind, too, I mean, we've got an incredible amount of optionality, again,
compared to the average regional bank with little over half of our bond portfolio sitting in unrealized gain, but then
again too, the goal would be to accrete that meaning discount up to par over the life of that book because that's all
government rate from that standpoint. So, we've taken the approach of maintaining that flexibility so we earn back
that discount which reduced capital a year back at the combination closing. And by utilizing that, we utilize
overnight or wholesale funding in that two to four-month tenor to maintain that overall level liquidity. We have
reduced the overall level of on balance sheet liquidity where we were sitting up closer to $3 billion early mid-2023
[indiscernible] (00:27:54) cash. We've now taken that down into the, call it, [ph] 1.5 to 2 (00:27:58) range. I could
see that probably dropping a little bit more in the 2025, but probably not too much more.

So, I wanted to talk about the leaning into those public deposits, could you just elaborate on the thought process

Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hey, Brandon, this is Tory. So, we have a lot of existing customers in the bank that are municipalities spread
throughout the footprint. Most of them are smaller rural communities. And, there we have strong relationships with
them and just made a very significant effort to go out and call on that group and ask for more deposits in the bank.
And we â€“ it says a lot about the capability of the teams, both in the branches and in commercial banking, to have
those relationships and to call on them to further deepen and strengthen those relationships. And that was the
effort. It's that time of year as tax payments come in. So they have more money and distributed to us what we
thought was really good idea.

And Brandon, I'll add to that as Tory mentioned, that local presence and working together, it's not just existing
customers and then maybe getting a little bit of a price [ph] stop (00:29:45) on some of that reserve money that
can lead you into â€“ we're talking about full relationships. We're talking to them about their operating accounts.
That sales cycle takes a little longer, but we're already seeing positive momentum into new names that came on
board in a money market type of account that are â€“ I want to investigate my operating account with you. That's
when that relationship really gets cemented. And that, as Tory said, that's what they do, people â€“ they live, they
work in the communities. They know the individuals that are at the public entities. And they're building
relationships and they're asking for the business. And with our capabilities, with the new [ph] team (00:30:29)
capabilities that came on board for a lot of our footprint as well, we're getting looks and we're winning that â€“ we're
going to win that business and that momentum is building.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. And it's a great funding [ph] alternative (00:30:44) to, not on the operating, we get the operating account,
but then with their surplus liquidity, we provide an [ph] alternative (00:30:54) to the local government pools. And
it's a way of providing â€“ bringing in deposit balances without cannibalizing our core deposit base or repricing the
whole sector of our deposit base. And so, it's kind of a different lever that we can pull, help creates noise. And in
my prepared remarks, I made a reference to the results of the quarter don't necessarily reflect the quality of our
deposit base, but that's what I was really getting at, is that, this is just a lever we can pull. And the fall when tax
proceeds are coming in for municipalities is a great time to pull that lever.

Got it. Got it. And just my follow-up would be, could you â€“ do you care to quantify the level of the amount of public
funds deposits you have? And would you consider these deposits higher beta relative to maybe some of your
more core deposits?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
I think you have to bifurcate it because we do have the operating relationship with virtually all of these public
entities. And so, that's going to behave more like a traditional part of our portfolio. And then you have the â€“ what I
referenced as an alternative to the local government pools. And so I think Ron's got the detail you're looking for.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, we do highlight that in those trends on page 17 of the earnings presentation. But in total, $2.9 billion of total
public deposits. And that was up roughly $0.5 billion, a little under $0.5 billion for the quarter. And of that, you're
going to be probably in the [ph] 10%, 15% range would be the core operating (00:32:43) accounts, 20% probably
tops. But, a good stable base.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. Okay. And just lastly, Ron, I know you're working to kind of reduce asset sensitivity just given the full rate
curve and the potential for rates to come down. Are there any actions that you're considering or looking at that
would make sense at this point to achieve that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, great question. It's really difficult on the derivative side just given pricing and expectations. But we took that
shot and we did that, you can see the trending there, too, on page 11 of the presentation with how we
repositioned the portion of the bond portfolio in that first week post close back in Q1, and then also utilization of
shorter-term wholesale funding.
We had the broker deposits or Home Loan Bank advances to help offset the deposit flows during the year. Those
two items, in and of themselves, basically act as a â€“ like a swap, benefits you in rate down because you're locked
out, cash flow's on the bond portfolio and you'll have fully floating down cash flows on the right side of the balance
sheet. So that was really the majority of the change from a year back to now where â€“ in the past year back, we
had a more traditional asset sensitivity profile and today we're relatively neutral.

Operator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Chris McGratty of KBW.
Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Oh, great. Thanks for the question. Ron, maybe on your expense guide for a minute, the $1 billion or $1.1 billion,
what â€“ I'm interested in your comments on what the revenue environment would be at different points of that
guide.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Good question, Chris. Generally, the â€“ historically, the movement on the expense side directly tied to revenue
would have to do with home lending back in a different â€“ much lower rate environment, right? You see seasonality
over the course of the year which would drive higher revenue in the second and third quarter, lower seasonal in
first and fourth, you'd have corresponding expense trends along the lines.
I'd say our outlook here is not for significant rates down [ph] world (00:35:09) to where home lending is picking up
significantly in volumes. So it's going to be really range bound within that NIM, is going to be the driver of the
revenue side. And I think over the course of the year, ex any legacy home lending seasonality, you're generally
going to see higher payroll tax-type items in the first two quarters of the year and then those tail off in the second
two quarters of the year.
You also generally see annual merit cycles which basically approximates inflation rates at the start of the second
quarter. So, you see a little bit of a lift and then stabilization over the course of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And, Clint, maybe on capital, you noted in the release tier 1 of 9.6% is about
your 9% target and your total is within 20 basis points. Could you help us on when the buyback would be more of
a discussion or announcement? Is it when you hit 12%, you have to build a buffer to 12%? How are you thinking
about the buyback given the outlook?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I think that, I mean, 12% is kind of like the Fed trying stick the [ph] lending (00:36:30) on the economy. It's
difficult to just get to 12% and keep it there. And so I think that we'd want a little bit of a buffer before we
implemented the buyback. Probably not a huge buffer but enough that we could do a meaningful buyback and still
be above 12% after you took that into account.

So I know I'm not giving you like hard and fast timeline or number, but we do see and you can see the trend over
the last three quarters of how capital builds. There are some things as the rate environment, we do get three cuts.
I think that that gives us some additional optionality even over and above what we already have on our balance
sheet, some flexibility that can put us in a position to do a buyback sooner than later.
What we're probably really talking is a one quarter or two quarters before we would do it just naturally through
steady state with the 20 bps, 25 bps of capital accretion each quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up, would that be the top use of capital beyond growing your business
that you've talked about, or is there an alternative use? I know you have dividend that's pretty competitive, but
inorganic growth at all on the table?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. The regular dividend, obviously, is something that we have talked about that we want to be consistent and
provide that, and for some of our investors, that's a â€“ it's a very important component of their investment in our
company. The organic growth component of it, Tory mentioned in his prepared remarks the pipelines, and I've
had the opportunity to meet with some of our market leaders over the past 30 days and when they talk about what
their pipelines look like and the opportunities they have in front of them from a business perspective, many of you
have seen Ron in person when he talks about the bond portfolio and he just gets giddy, that's the same type of
reaction that our bankers have with the opportunities that they're currently in the middle of pursuing.
But even with that said, I think the capital generation is so strong that any level of reasonable organic growth, I
don't think it outstrips the building of those ratios between the regular dividend, organic growth. And so it does
leave us with buyback options. Potentially, depending on if buybacks were â€“ didn't make sense, then we could
always look at whether a special dividend makes sense.
And then to your question inorganic growth, I think that we're â€“ it feels like we're in a time period like we were in
mid-2020 where the M&A markets are kind of frozen. The math is very hard right now. I know there's been a few
things announced, but those aren't healthy, thriving franchises that would be of interest to us, we don't feel like
that it'd be additive to our long-term value.
But that will change with the passage of time, and so I do think that there's going to be some opportunities to at
least look at things. But as we've said before, the size company we are, the eight states that we're in, there's not a
plethora of opportunities that move the needle for us, so we'd be very selective and disciplined about looking at
any type of inorganic opportunities.

Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good afternoon. Wanted to clarify, is it safe to assume a loan growth expectation would mirror your
balance sheet growth expectation of no growth to 3% or possibly outstrip that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hey, Jeff, this is Ron. Good afternoon. Good question and yeah, I mean, ideally over time, you want the deposit
growth to match the loan growth, and that's our goal here over the course of 2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. So loan growth that â€“ maybe no growth, I want to kind of pair that up, Clint, with kind of the field and that
getting us out there. Is there a point where you're kind of tamping down your kind of loan officers on, hey, we got
to true it up with deposit growth? I'm just trying to get the assumptions underlying of a pretty limited growth and
kind of meet that with kind of the team. And you're going on the anniversary of the merger close, just want to kind
of get the sense for feet under those folks and starting to produce you know pretty significant net growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, it's a great question, it gets back to the response I had on inorganic growth and when we think about â€“
there â€“ we've talked for the last couple of quarters about being relationship-centric. And in a QT-type
environment, where we're holding back and being very restrained is on transactional real estate-type things. Our
C&I teams, small business bankers, I mean, they've got a green light and the ability to go out, but I don't think
there's a single banker in this company that doesn't that â€“ and I use the term banker purposely, we don't have
lenders, we have bankers, and that they need to go get the full relationship, needs to come with deposits. And
they're not going to fund dollar for dollar. I mean, that's not the nature of it, but that's why we have our robust 300
strong retail network to help with the funding.
But that's where I think the optimism is. The integration's behind us, we've shut down the integration management
office and they're ready. They're on the their front foot, they're ready to go play offense. And, Tory, I don't know if
you have anything to add.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Torran B. Nixon A
President-Commercial Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, Jeff, it's Tory. I would just maybe reiterate a little bit of Clint's comments around just the salesforce and the
bankers in the footprint, their strong desire to grow market share, to â€“ really to manage what we have and keep
what we have and continue to expand with what we have but to grow market share. And that sometimes is a
relationship that includes a loan and sometimes it's a relationship where there's no lending activity.
A deposit only or deposit and core fee income relationship is very valuable and supports this local presence that
Chris always talks about and this ability to grow their book of business. And our focus is definitely on the C&I side
of the house. And as you could see in the growth in real estate, it's been â€“ it's flattened and on purpose and we're
pushing on the C&I front. And so we've got a lot of great bankers in great markets that are out pounding the
pavement and looking to bring in new names into the bank.

Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Appreciate it. Wanted to maybe hop over the credit side of things. And really kind of looking at that kind of the [ph]
crosshairs going (00:45:07) to FinPac, thinking about I think mid-last year we were kind of pointing to â€“ maybe it
was hopeful or some signs forming that those trucking losses would [ph] add (00:45:19) lower, it looks like we're
bouncing back up.
And I guess kind of over the course of 2024, if you think about losses in FinPac, is it safe to assume we could still
be in that 5% to 6% for the full year or do you see any trend that we could kind of come off a cliff with that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank D. Namdar A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Hey, Jeff. Yeah I do not expect that this trend goes all through 2024. I mean, if we look at the loss curves
and really the vintages that have caused this pain, the vintages were really the last half of 2021 and all of 2022.
From a loss curve perspective, we're through all of 2021 and we're about halfway through 2022. So I believe we
will see at the end of the second quarter those losses start to tail off at a more rapid way than they have
historically.
And don't forget, I mean, the fourth quarter is a tough barometer for collecting because of all the holidays that are
during that quarter. And in this space, I mean, remember, I mean, FinPac is â€“ it may be a subsidiary of the bank
and provides a valuable product set for the bank, but at its core, it's still a finance company. In a finance company,
this type of activity and what we're seeing currently is not abnormal. And if you go out there and survey our
competitors, they're experiencing the exact same thing even at a worse clip than we are.
What is encouraging is that it is isolated to the trucking portfolio and we do see the light through the data that we
have that there is an end in sight and I do believe it'll be halfway through this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. Just to kind of get into that vintage â€“ and I appreciate the color there...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank D. Namdar A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
...that, the thought that as we moved into the back half of 2023 and hopeful of a decline, was it that you got into
some of those 2022 vintages that were like, oh, wow, this is also troublesome? Is that why sort of the extended...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank D. Namdar A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I mean â€“ and we're coming out of 2021 and we did see that 2022 was also displaying some of the elevated
loss characteristics. And so we kind of had a feeling that it would it would be a long drag out process for getting
back to that 3.5% clip. But we do see it in the early returns, I will tell you, for the 2023 vintage, they're very
17


Columbia Banking System, Inc.
(COLB) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2023 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2024
positive. So that is encouraging, that the tweaks that we've made to the model and the criteria really in the
portfolio as a whole but in particular the trucking portfolio is really â€“ seems to be paying off in the 2023 vintage.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Great, thank you. And then one last one, Ron, I'll take another crack. I didn't really response on the margin
trajectory. I know it resides with deposit success, but I guess to put it more clearly, you expect more compression
in the first half of 2024 versus the second half when you layer on potential rate cuts, your 3 basis points of cuts?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
That's correct. Just given the fact that we've got that conservative estimate in there for the deposit betas, and that
will really be a driver of â€“ if we do see the rates down environment, I expect we'll outperform. And I expect our
betas will be above the 30% on the down. I mean they're closer to, like I said earlier, to 50% on the up. Overriding
all of that, of course, will be what's going on with just basic customer deposit flows and you heard enough
conversation on that point today. So we'll see how it plays out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
If we're talking $350 million, $360 million for the full year, you may shoot to that mid-year and then it's kind of a
coming up is sort of how you would trend line that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
In that view, over the course of the year, you saw a couple of rate cuts in the second half of the year and we, like
most banks, expect that [ph] it will overperform (00:49:57) on our deposit betas to the rate's downside and yeah,
that's true statement.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Ron, I just wanted to ask a few questions on NII. The $4.3 billion of loans that you have above floors, do you
happen to know where those flow rates are?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
They're sitting more than three cuts down.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
We'll have that detail into the next quarter's release, but they're definitely more than three cuts down.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
All right. Would they be more than the forward curve down the five or maybe six depending on the day?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
I don't have that in front of my hands. But again, recall going back over the last two â€“ year-and-a-half, two years
as rates were increasing, it was easily more than, what, six cuts would be [ph] 100, 150 bps (00:51:06), is easily
more than 150 bps ago that we started to slow down talking about loans are going above their floors.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Yeah. Okay. I noticed that you shifted some of the borrowing base to BTFP this quarter. I think it was maybe $200
million of utilization. You still got a lot of FHLB lines. And if I'm remembering correctly, those are pretty short from
a duration perspective. I think there's like an 80-something-basis-point gap between the cost of your borrowings
right now and what BTFP is. Would you consider shifting the rest of the borrowings to BTFP to help with the
margin? And if so, is that contemplated in your guidance at all?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
We are looking at that. It's not the full amount of the Home Loan Bank advances, just given the capacity at the
BTFP, but we are looking at that here over the course of the first quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay, great. So if I look at the NII sensitivity slide that you all provide, it looks like in either up 100 and 200 down,
100 and 200 kind of scenario. It's negative for NII and all but a couple of them as of December 31. And then I
19


Columbia Banking System, Inc.
(COLB) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2023 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2024
don't think you have a lot in fixed asset repricing. So if we got no cuts, maybe that kind of incremental deposit
beta creep and lag that you've talked about would continue.
So I guess I'm struggling a little bit, Ron, to think about holistically, like what what's the best rate environment that
you could foresee just kind of looking at those pieces of the puzzle?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, interesting question. I would suggest this, that in anyone's interest rate risk modeling, if they're
looking at the difference between 0.7% and 1.1% and saying there's exact precision in that, they're not being
truthful with you, right? There's so many assumptions that go into that over the course of the year, inclusive of
customer deposit flows, betas, timing lags.
So I kind of look at all those as relatively neutral within their â€“ if they're within a point or two of each other just
because I know that's generally the [ph] great (00:53:24) range you're going to be facing over the course of the
year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And what is the NIB mix that's contemplated within your NII guidance? I'm sorry if I missed that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Within the traditional NII guidance or interest rate sensitivity analysis, which is what this is, you generally assume
a static balance sheet and then things reprice into themselves.
So again, that's where I got to earlier talking about within the range of the guide, if we're better on the deposit
side, then we're going to be on the upper end. If we're not, we're going to be on the lower end.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And then last one for me, just if I take the pieces of your of your guidance, $48.5 billion of average earning
assets, 3.55% on the margin and then you factor in the expenses, if I do something just like last three quarters'
average fee income, assume that's the run rate, annualize it and grow it by low- to mid-single digit, it kind of
implies like [ph] mid-780s (00:54:27) on PPNR. Am I far off the mark there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Brody, I don't have the calculator out in front of me to run through that math with you. I'd just ask â€“ we're not
providing the inputs in the guidance on EPS. We're not giving an EPS guide. But there's other maybe specific
questions that might help you on the modeling side. I highly suggest contacting Jacque. She's great and she'll set
you straight.

Hey. Thanks for the questions. And Brody, [ph] 780 (00:55:11) sounds â€“ that's kind of where I am right now.
First question, just on expenses relative to the balance sheet size, if we end up at the low end of that average

as well, $1 billion versus $1.1 billion?

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
There's potential for that. Obviously, we have efficiency improvements that we're working through as well. But
there's also just enough uncertainty when you look into the year inclusive of inflation rates to say our target is
going be somewhere relatively in the middle of that and there's downside, there's upside and see which way it
plays over the year. But we wanted to just make sure we recognize that there is some level of uncertainty to
timing and flow over the course of the year. So not giving a specific guide on that by quarter or the trajectory.

Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I'm just trying to be consistent with the balance sheet size relative to expenses. Should we be consistent or not?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
There is a little bit of movement with the balance sheet size, but again you also have changes in, say, for
example, deferred loan costs which are influenced by the balance sheet size or we get leverage within deposits
per branch, which doesn't necessarily have an impact on expenses other than incentives. So it's just difficult to
say with precision at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Understood. Okay. And then just the step-up in other non-interest expense, I think it went from â€“ excluding
merger charges. So call it I, don't know, $45 million and change, $45 million, $46 million up from $38 million last
quarter. Anything unusual in there that we should strip out going forward? I'm just trying to get a sense for...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. No, good question. I take a look at slide 13 again. Jacque did a great job showing the movement in the
bridge and a good chunk of those items inclusive of the FDIC special assessment. But a good chunk of those
items are elevated and not expected to continue at those levels.

Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. I know the FDIC, that's obvious. But I'm talking about in the merger, we're stripping all that out. I'm just
talking about anything else beyond FDIC and merger charges?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, you look through, again, on that bridge on slide 13, you'll see some items related to small
equipment, repairs and maintenance. Something more on the occupancy and equipment area. But then you got
legal title and other, those are in the other area. So let's try to call those out on the bridge.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Got it. Okay, fair enough. And then back on the deposit beta outlook for kind of the remainder of the cycle,
did I hear you correctly that you're expecting the cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta to get to 53% at the
peak? Is that what I heard?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
That is what our models would suggest. But then again, recognize that those are models.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Understood. Okay. Just want to make I heard that. And then just on the provision, I mean it's obviously a moving
target in any given quarter. But it looks like a decent step-up in reserve build here and I understand classified
increased a little bit, but not meaningfully. I think most macro models actually improved this quarter, so I'm a little
surprise in the step-up in reserve build relative to the migration in the macro.
But how should we think about provisioning going forward and is this a somewhat outsized, you think or not?
We're going to assume higher charge-offs just with normalization, but I'm trying to get a sense for kind of reserve
coverage and whether or not this provision might be a little elevated.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, good question. I guess in terms of the models and the slightly worsened economic forecast, I mean
there are dozens of variables that go into CECL models not simply just GDP or CPI rates. You also have things
along the lines of vacancy rates or rent changes within various markets that we operate, which factor into those.
So I would characterize it as just in total across, again, those dozens of variables. They were just a little bit worse.
But that just means they were a little bit better a quarter ago and they're all a guess, right? They're all projections,
which we factor in the model from that standpoint.
So underlying trends, though, I'd refer back to Frank's comments earlier, right? We do expect we'll see some
abatement on the FinPac side, and then the rest is going to be what's going on with the overall economy two or
three quarters from now. And then more interestingly of those forecasts looking ahead over the life of the portfolio
at those points in time. So...

Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Capital Markets. Your line is open.

Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks. Good afternoon.

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Good afternoon.

Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, just most of my questions have been asked and answered. But on slide 9, the red bar on deposit pricing, it's
kind of looking at that over the last couple of quarters. And Ron, what do you think that bar looks like in the first
and second quarter? I know there's a lot that goes into it, but I guess it's this this rate of change in deposit pricing.
And I'm just â€“ if you could take a stab at what you think that looks like over the next couple of quarters, that might
help.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Look, I mean, good question. I would refer back to â€“ we do disclose in here the spot rates as of year-end.
So use that as your starting point for when you look into Q1. But I also say that the 36 bps change as delivered in
the walk on page 9 was really â€“ a good chunk of that was related to the decision we made back in late in Q3,
where we brought on broker deposits to help just Home Loan Bank advances, which are in the borrowings
category, right?
So I wouldn't expect as big of a move, but again it depends on what we do with those balances over the course of
the year. But that was really a good chunk of the driver there, of that about 36 bps in Q4.

Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Now, that's specific to interest-bearing deposits. I talked about, though, we saw in interest-bearing liabilities, it
wasn't as big of a change, and that's just because of a shift from a little bit higher cost borrowings and to similar
cuts in broker deposits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah, that was kind of my next question I wanted to ask about funding cost peaking. And I
think you may be saying you're reasonably close on that, is that fair?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, we give models, right? But let's also assume generally a two-quarter lag on the back end of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Merrywell A
President-Consumer Banking of Umpqua Bank, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Jon, this is Chris. And as I mentioned earlier in the call â€“ hey, Jon, this is Chris. As I mentioned earlier in
the call, we're starting to see the market pull back a little bit. So I think towards are we at the peak, we can't tell
you that. I don't know. It appears that we're we're somewhere there. I would expect it to start slowing down from
what we experienced in the previous quarters. And some of the that are coming due on the CD side, there's not
as big of a lift between their current rate and where we project we might be in a month or two.
So all that being said, I think the pace is going to certainly slow down. And we'll see what everybody does out
there. It's a fluid market as well so â€“ but pace should slow down.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Okay. Ron, one more crack at the most annoying question of the call. But the margin trajectory, is it safe to
assume the way it sits right now with your guide, U-shape, J-shape type margin for 2024, with kind of a midyear
trough, is that fair?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald L. Farnsworth A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
I think, again, assumptions around that are going to be around timing and number of cuts and where the betas
are. But underlying all of it is going to be where core customer deposit flows. So just not prepared to give a guide
in terms of what that looks like by quarter, We're giving you an estimate of what we feel it could for the full year
from our target standpoint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.
