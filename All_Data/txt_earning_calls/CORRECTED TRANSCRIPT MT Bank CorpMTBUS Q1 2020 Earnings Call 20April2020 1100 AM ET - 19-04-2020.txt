Q1 2020 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2020
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the M&T Bank First Quarter 2020
Earnings Call. At this time, all participants lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there
will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I'd now like to turn the conference over to the Director of Investor Relations, Don MacLeod. Please go ahead.

Donald J. MacLeod
Administrative Vice President, Assistant Secretary & Director-Investor Relations, M&T Bank Corp.
Thank you, Brandi, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to thank you for participating in M&T's first quarter 2020
earnings conference call, both by telephone and through the webcast. If you have not read the earnings release
we issued this morning, you can access it along with the financial tables and schedules from our website,
www.mtb.com, and by clicking on the Investor Relations link and then on the Events & Presentations link.
Also, before we start, I'd like to mention that comments made during this call might contain forward-looking
statements relating to the banking industry and to M&T Bank Corporation. M&T encourages participants to refer
to our SEC filings on Forms 8-K, 10-K, and 10-Q, including the Form 8-K filed today in connection with our
earnings release, for a complete discussion of forward-looking statements and risk factors.
Now, I'd like to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Darren King.

Darren J. King
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. Before we start, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the
extraordinary efforts put forth by M&T's employees in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that over the past few
weeks has impacted virtually every aspect of our economy.
I'd like to share a story about our branches. When I first heard from Washington, DC, but when I've since heard
multiple times from across our footprint. In mid to late-March, all of our relationship bankers began reaching out to
customers to ensure they had appropriate access to their money, with a particular focus on customers who
infrequently use mobile and Web banking.
At the end of one such conversation, our banker asked the customer if there was anything else we could do to
help her. The customer said, I need food, my husband passed away, I lost my job and I have no food, I'm hungry.
[ph] Natalie (00:02:15) quickly brought this to the attention of her branch manager, who in turn shared the story
with the rest of the team, and they decided to do something about it.
After closing the branch for the day, the team went shopping and on their way home delivered a significant supply
of groceries to help our customer through her difficult time. Having previously managed the branch network, I can
assure you this procedure is not covered in the branch operations manual.
Next, I'd like to share some metrics that we believe highlight how M&T is operating in the current environment,
while practicing safe social distancing, helping customers, and enabling commerce. As of last Friday, 708 of our

733 full-service domestic branches are open and operating with a few restrictions. Drive-through windows and
ATMs are operating normally, and branch lobbies are on an appointment-only basis.
For commercial and consumer customers, M&T has provided a host of relief options, including loan maturity
extensions, payment deferrals, fee waivers and low interest rate loan products. Our mortgage servicing group has
worked to help customers seeking payment relief for loans we own, or for those we service for others. So far,
we've provided assistance to over 70,000 customers whose loan balances total some $13 billion. Just under 90%
of those balances are serviced for others. In total, we've assisted an approximately 10% of the mortgage loans we
service.
Similarly, for customers with other consumer loans, auto and recreation finance, credit cards, and home equity
loans, we've provided nearly 17,000 customers with some form of payment relief. These customers hold balances
of over $500 million, and represent just under 4% of our consumer loan portfolio.
M&T has been helping small business customers to access the government's Paycheck Protection Program, or
PPP. This program offers loans backed by the Small Business Administration intended to sustain monthly
business expenses such as paychecks for employees who would otherwise be laid off, rent and utilities. In total,
M&T associates helped a total of 27,711 clients get approved for PPP loans totaling more than $6.4 billion. Over
2000 M&T bankers worked around the clock to make that possible for our customers. Those companies
collectively employ more than 600,000 workers, and if additional funding is made available, we have a backlog of
additional clients, we are ready to help get approved.
For other business customers, large and small, and who entered the pandemic in good standing, we are offering
short-term payment deferrals or other modifications to their existing credit agreements to help them manage
short-term cash flow challenges. So far, we've provided modifications to nearly 6,000 businesses with an
aggregate principal balance of $11 billion.
And last week, we began receiving funds from the Treasury Department for deposit of COVID-19 stimulus
payments into our customers' accounts. We know there'll be more to do in the coming weeks, and our team
stands ready to be a source of strength for our customers and our communities.
Next, let's look at the financial results for the quarter. Diluted GAAP earnings per common share were $1.93 for
the first quarter of 2020 compared with $3.60 in the fourth quarter of 2019 and $3.35 in the first quarter of 2019.
Net income for the quarter was $269 million compared with $493 million in the linked quarter, and $483 million in
the year-ago quarter.
On a GAAP basis, M&T's first quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 0.9%
and an annualized return on average common equity of 7%. This compares with rates of 1.6% and 12.95%,
respectively, in the previous quarter. Included in GAAP results in the recent quarter were after-tax expenses from
the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $3 million or $0.02 per common share, little change from the
prior quarter.
Consistent with our long-term practice, M&T provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or
tangible basis from which we have only ever excluded the after-tax effect of amortization of intangible assets, as
well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions when they occur.
M&T's net operating income for the first quarter, which excludes intangible amortization, was $272 million. This
compares with $496 million in the linked quarter and $486 million in last year's first quarter. Diluted net operating

earnings per common share were $1.95 for the recent quarter compared with $3.62 in 2019's fourth quarter and
$3.38 in the first quarter of 2019.
Net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible
common shareholders' equity of 0.94% and 10.39% for the recent quarter. The comparable returns were 1.67%
and 19.08% in the fourth quarter of 2019.
In accordance with the SEC's guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP
and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity. Recall that both GAAP and net operating earnings
for the first quarter of 2019 were impacted by a noteworthy item. Included in that quarter's results was in addition
to our legal reserves of $50 million relating to a subsidiary's role as a trustee for customers' Employee Stock
Ownership Plans. This amounted to $37 million after-tax effect or 0.27 per diluted common share.
Turning to the balance sheet and the income statement, taxable equivalent net interest income was $982 million
in the first quarter of 2020, down by $32 million from the linked quarter. This comes as the result of a lower level
of average interest-earning assets, combined with a nearly stable net interest margin. Margin for the past quarter
was 3.65%, up 1 basis point from 3.64% in the linked quarter.
As we indicated on our January conference call, a more favorable mix of earning assets, including a lower
absolute level of average funds on deposit with the Fed, combined with a higher proportion of loans, provided a
benefit to the margin of an estimated 11 basis points. Further declines in interest rates caused about 3 basis
points of pressure to the margin, a relatively modest decrease, helped by an 11 basis point decline in the cost of
interest-bearing deposits. As a result of higher forecasted prepayments, accelerated premium amortization on
residential mortgage loans acquired in the Hudson City acquisition and on mortgage-backed securities, accounted
for another 4 basis points of pressure.
Several other factors combined to contribute to a net 3 basis point margin reduction. Those factors include: the
lesser day count in the quarter compared with the prior quarter; and non-accrual loan interest, which includes the
change in the recognition of interest income on acquired loans as a result of our adoption of CECL.
Average interest-earning assets declined by just over 2%, reflecting a 31% decline in deposits with the Fed and a
9% decline in investment securities. Partially offsetting those declines was a 2% increase in average loans
outstanding compared with the previous quarter.
Looking at the loans by category on an average basis compared with the linked quarter. Commercial and
industrial loans increased 3%, including growth in dealer floor plan loans. Commercial real estate loans also grew
by 3% compared to the fourth quarter. Residential real estate loans, which include mortgage loans acquired in the
Hudson City transaction, continued to pay down, consistent with our expectations. The portfolio declined by more
than 2% or approximately $400 million. Consumer loans were up nearly 1%. Activity was consistent with recent
quarters where growth in indirect auto and recreational finance loans has been outpacing declines in home equity
lines and loans.
On an end-of-period basis, commercial and industrial loans increased by $2.4 billion or more than 10%. We
estimate that draws on previously undrawn contractually committed lines accounted for nearly $2 billion of that
increase, as the COVID-19 crisis led many customers to access funding sooner rather than later to manage their
own liquidity.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2020
Average core customer deposits, which exclude deposits received at M&T's Cayman Islands office and CDs over
$250,000, declined less than 1% or nearly $630 million compared to the prior quarter. There were multiple factors
that drove the change: lower average mortgage escrow deposits, a decline from seasonally high commercial
deposits in the fourth quarter, and time deposit maturities.
Those factors were partially offset by draws on credit lines being immediately deposited back into customers'
operating accounts, lower levels of off-balance sheet sweep activity by customers as lower rates have made
sweeps less attractive, and a moderate flight to quality as customers view funds on deposit at M&T as safer than
other alternatives.
On an end-of-period basis, core deposits were up 7%, reflecting new inflows of mortgage escrow deposits, as well
as the redeposit of line draws, lower levels of off-balance sheet sweeps, and the flight to quality issues I just
mentioned.
Foreign office deposits decreased 3% on an average basis and nearly 28% on an end-of-period basis. With
sweep rates nearing historic lows, we expect to see less on-balance sheet sweep activity by commercial
customers, consistent with our experience during the zero rate environment over the first half of the prior decade.
Instead, funds would likely remain in their operating accounts, either DDA or interest checking.
Turning to non-interest income, non-interest income totaled $529 million in the first quarter compared with $521
million in the prior quarter. The recent quarter included $21 million of valuation losses on equity securities, largely
on our remaining holdings of GSE preferred stock, while 2019's final quarter included $6 million of similar losses.
Mortgage banking revenues were $128 million in the recent quarter compared with $118 million in the linked
quarter. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale were $919 million in the quarter, up more than 25% from
$727 million in the fourth quarter.
Total residential mortgage banking revenues, including origination and servicing activities, were $98 million in the
first quarter, improved from $91 million in the prior quarter. The increase reflects the higher volume of loans
originated for sale combined with a stronger gain-on-sale margin. Commercial mortgage banking revenues were
$30 million in the first quarter compared with $27 million in the linked quarter, and the comparable figure in the
first quarter of 2019 was $29 million.
Trust income was $149 million in the recent quarter, down slightly from $152 million in the previous quarter.
Results for the first quarter were solid through the first two months, but were then dampened by the March
collapse in equity markets.
Service charges on deposit accounts were $106 million compared with $111 million in the fourth quarter. The
decline from the linked quarter reflected some normal, seasonally lower levels of customer activity in addition to
the COVID-19-driven slowdown in payments activity. During the first quarter of 2020, M&T received a cash
distribution of $23 million from Bayview Lending Group. M&T's results in the first quarter of 2019 included a
similar distribution amounting to $37 million.
Turning to expenses, operating expenses for the first quarter, which exclude the amortization of intangible assets,
were $903 million. As noted, $889 million of operating expenses in the first quarter of 2019 included the $50
million addition to the litigation reserve.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2020
Operating expenses for the recent quarter included approximately $67 million of seasonally higher compensation
costs related to the accelerated recognition of equity compensation expense for certain retirement-eligible
employees, the HSA contribution, the impact of annual incentive compensation payouts on the 401(k) match and
FICA payments, as well as the annual reset in FICA payments, and unemployment insurance. Those same items
amounted to an increase in salaries and benefits of approximately $60 million in last year's first quarter.
As usual, we expect those seasonal factors to decline significantly as we enter the second quarter. Excluding
those seasonal factors, salaries and benefits were a little change from the prior quarter. The year-over-year
increase reflects the higher head count as we've been deepening our bench of talent, which, as we've previously
noted, has allowed us to reduce our reliance on outside contractors and bring new products and services to our
customers more quickly.
Other cost of operations for the past quarter included a $10 million addition to the valuation allowance on our
capitalized mortgage servicing rights. Recall that there was a $16 million reduction in the allowance in 2019's
fourth quarter.
The efficiency ratio, which excludes intangible amortization from the numerator and securities gains or losses
from the denominator, was 58.9% in the recent quarter compared with 53.1% in 2019's fourth quarter and 57.6%
in the first quarter of 2019. Those ratios in the first quarters of 2019 and 2020 each reflect the seasonally elevated
compensation expenses.
Next, let's turn to credit. What had been a relatively healthy economy at the end of 2019 and early this year has
deteriorated faster than most of us would have expected. While the first quarter 2020 changes in non-accrual
loans and net charge-offs were still fairly benign, we are preparing for the likelihood of increased credit costs as
the economic impact of the pandemic and the unprecedented stimulus programs unfold.
At the end of 2019, in accordance with the then prevailing incurred loss accounting standard, M&T's allowance for
credit losses amounted to $1.05 billion or 1.16% of loans. In connection with the adoption of the current expected
credit loss standard, M&T added $132 million to the allowance, reflecting higher lifetime loss expectations under
CECL. Those expectations included certain assumptions such as economic growth, unemployment and other
factors.
The provision for loan losses in the first quarter amounted to $250 million, exceeding net charge-offs by $201
million and increasing the allowance for credit losses to $1.4 billion or 1.47% of loans. The allowance currently
reflects an updated series of assumptions reflecting a more adverse economic scenario. Those assumptions
include a significant deterioration of future macroeconomic indicators used in our reasonable and supportable
forecasts, including an unemployment rate approaching double digits and a significant contraction of the GDP in
the second quarter. The assumptions reflect a moderate recovery in the second half of 2020.
Non-accrual loans amounted to $963 million or 1.06% of loans at the end of 2019. In connection with our adoption
of the CECL accounting standard on January 1, 2020, M&T reclassified $171 million of loans that were previously
acquired at a discount as non-accrual loans. Non-accrual loans as of March 31 amounted to $1.1 billion, an
increase of $99 million from December. Thus, except for the accounting reclassification, non-accrual loans
declined during the past quarter. At the end of the quarter, non-accrual loans as a percentage of loans was
1.13%.
Net charge-offs for the recent quarter amounted to $49 million. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of
total loans were 22 basis points for the first quarter compared with 18 basis points in the fourth quarter. Loans 90

days past due, on which we continue to accrue interest, were $530 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of
those loans, $464 million or 88% were guaranteed by government-related entities.
Turning to capital, M&T's common equity Tier 1 ratio was an estimated 9.2% compared with 9.73% at the end of
the fourth quarter, and which reflects the net impact of higher loans and earnings net of dividends and share
repurchases. During the first quarter, M&T repurchased 2.6 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost
of $374 million.
Now, turning to the outlook, to start, it goes without saying, but I'll say it anyway, that the outlook and any forward-
looking statements we made on the January earnings conference call are no longer applicable.
As far as the balance sheet goes, our liquidity assets, short-term investments and the deposits with the Fed will
be somewhat fluid as shorter term deposits, particularly from the servicing operation, expand or contract with
refinancing activity. We wouldn't expect to make any significant purchase of investment securities in this
environment.
Future balance movement will be impacted by the pace and breadth of the economic restart once the pandemic is
believed to be under control. Holding government programs aside for a moment, average loans for the year will
expand somewhat faster than previously expected as the line draws at the end of the first quarter roll into the
average, as well as the impact of any principal deferrals. As showrooms are mostly closed around the country,
automobile sales and inventory are stalled, as are those of recreational vehicles, although to a somewhat lesser
extent.
Focusing on government programs and their impact on the balance sheet, the most certain is the PPP program.
While the balances that will be added to our balance sheet are known, as is the yield, there is a great degree of
uncertainty as to the duration of these loans. These are extensively two-year loans, but payments and forgiveness
will result in many loans being on the balance sheets for less than that time, introducing uncertainty into the size
of the loan portfolio and the net interest margin in the coming months. The details of the Main Street Lending
Program are still being finalized, and as such, our level of participation in the program, if any, remains unclear.
Fees held up well in the first quarter, however, we are closely monitoring trends in interest rates, equity markets,
and pandemic responses to assess their impact on our businesses. Residential mortgage applications continue to
be very strong with rates as low as they are.
Trust income will be impacted by the state of the equity markets by a likely resumption of waivers of money
market mutual fund management fees although zero rate environment persists, and the potential for an extended
slowdown in debt capital markets activity.
Payment volumes in aggregate are down slightly, and we're offering fee waivers to our consumer customers.
Certain industries, such as restaurants, travel and other leisure activities, are being more heavily impacted by
locally-mandated social distancing lockdowns. Lower payments activity will likely persist while those restrictions
remain in effect.
We expect the seasonal salaries and benefits surge we had in the first quarter to normalize as it does every year.
We have significantly curtailed hiring in this environment and have been actively redeploying team members
around the bank to address shifting business needs. Like other businesses around the country, shelter-in-place
mandates will impact other aspects of our expense base, such as the use of contractors and travel and
entertainment expense.

Credit costs are difficult to predict. But as mentioned earlier, we are preparing for a challenging environment.
While our consumer customers navigate through the forbearance period and our larger commercial customers
work through a period of temporary debt restructuring, the ultimate impact of recent events on credit will not likely
be clear for several months.
Turning to capital, the current environment has not caused us to reconsider our long-standing capital allocation
philosophy. Our primary use of capital is to support the economic activity of our customers while serving as a
source of strength in the communities we serve. We will maintain prudent levels of capital to support that
objective.
Of course, as you are aware, our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions
regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other
macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future, as we've just learned.
Now, let's open up the call to questions, before which Brandi will briefly review the instructions.

Good morning, Ken.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Just in terms of your CECL assumptions, it almost sounds like you're using the Moody's baseline from the end of
March, which I guess, has gotten materially worse since the end of March. Could you just talk about what you
might expect for provision, or how you're thinking about that as we go into second quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Sure. If you look at the Moody's, which we do look at their various scenarios, we consider a range of their
scenarios. The baseline is primary, but if you look at this quarter, I think it's their – the S3 scenario was also
considered in our thought process when we were thinking through the assumptions in the CECL.
And I guess, I'd just remind you that the economy and the expectations for the future are certainly in flux. And we
looked at those and considered those when we were going through our work at the end of the quarter. At that
point, we were probably expecting a sharp turn down and maybe a sharper recovery than what would appear to
be the case today, but as we go through the next 90 days, we'll know more. And we'll see how things unfold, how

quickly a restart happens or doesn't, and how those affect the future projections both from what we're seeing and
what Moody's is seeing as we go through the quarter and as we think about things at the end of this quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got you. Okay. No, I understood. That does help. I guess, maybe an easy question, just given what's happened to
the rates. I know you talked a little bit about the margin and the factors that affected it this quarter, but how are
you guys thinking about margin going into 2Q?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Well, it's our expectation that the margin's probably moving down in the quarter. When you look at the -- while
LIBOR has held up well, it did move down at the end of – well, as we went through the quarter, and it's important
to keep in mind, when pricing changes happen in the loan portfolio, and [Technical Difficulty] (00:29:30) the
benchmark rate or the reference rate gets updated usually in the first few days of the month. And so, any changes
in that later in the month don't get reflected until the following. And so, as you look at what happened this quarter
with the drop of 150 basis points coming after the first week in March, most of that will start to get reflected in April
and through the second quarter.
The only other thing that I'd just remind folks as we think about margin in the second quarter is the PPP loans are
going to have an impact on the margin. At 1%, those are low-yielding loans, although they carry a zero risk
weighting. That's a substantial portfolio that will come on stream in the next several days and will have a material
impact on the margins. So, I try to think about it a little bit both in terms of the margin, but also in focus on net
interest income and the dollars of net interest income and how those are likely to unfold over the course of the
next three, six and nine months.

Hey. Back in March, you guys gave some disclosure on some of the loan buckets you're watching a little more
carefully. Can you just give an update on the reserving you've done in those buckets and maybe some of the
credit metrics around those? I know you mentioned LTVs in your hotel book of about 54%. But if you could just

talk about the $6 billion or so you have in senior housing or assisted living centers and maybe the $7 billion in
retail, just trends you're seeing there, how you're thinking about reserving, that would be great?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. I guess if you look at the various portfolios, the ones that we're paying a lot of attention to, hotel, retail,
restaurants, leisure and to some extent the healthcare facilities. What we're seeing so far is still early in terms of
their economic performance. And when you look at – we don't have first quarter financials yet. When you looked
at where things were at the end of last year, they were still pretty strong. And so, to see a change in the portfolio
this early doesn't really happen. But as we look at the – at forbearance and payment relief, a lot of those
industries are places where they're getting some help. And when we look at some of the underlying trends in
terms of loan to values, they're still solid. I think it will take a while for loan to values to adjust as well because a lot
of times the value is a function of the cash flows, and it remains to be seen what the ultimate long-term set of
cash flows are with many of those industries, hotels being an obvious one.
And so, it's still little early to say that we're seeing severe challenges in those industries per se. But as we talked
about, when you look at the reserving, we've increased the reserve pretty substantially since the end of the year.
And that's the whole idea of CECL is to start to account for the impact of changing economy on various industries.
The other thing to keep in mind, which is still hard to really assess, is how the stimulus package, which is really
unprecedented, might impact any of these portfolios and, in particular, the PPP program as a result of that. Many
of the industries that we are concerned about have accessed the PPP program. And for our customers, they
should be receiving the funds – started over the weekend and should happen through the end of the week. And
that should give them some liquidity to help get through the next two-and-a-half months as the program was
designed. So, no material regrading at this point as we just spend our time actually working with customers and
calling them and making sure that we understand their situation and figure out ways to help keep them operating.

Perfect. Appreciate that detail. Do you happen to have the size of the restaurant book, in the leisure segment you
mentioned, or maybe just the overall portfolio of the segments you mentioned, the hotel [indiscernible] (00:34:01)
everything combined just to get a sense of what that total is?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. When you look through the 10-K, tables 5 and 6 outline a lot of the stuff. You look at hotels, between
permanent and construction, it's just about $4 billion. Retail, you mentioned, was about $6.3 billion. That covers a
broad range of industries. I guess, a couple of things to keep in mind in retail is when you look at C&I retail, a lot
of that is multi-unit retail and convenience stores associated with gas stations. And so, those have been essential
and those have been open, although I'm sure operating at lower volumes. And much of the retail book is actually
associated with multistorey buildings in Manhattan, and retail happens to be the first floor, but the way it gets
coded, it gets coded as retail.
If you look at restaurant and leisure, there are segments that aren't individually big enough that we call them out
separately in those tables. Together, they're about $2 billion. So, I give you that, they're contained within the other
and some of the other line items, but collectively, they're relatively small in the grand scheme of things.

As you talk to those clients, are they starting to see any customer attrition due to concerns around the virus at all,

general breakeven occupancy for those?

Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
So, it's still early in the process, and we haven't heard any mass defections. I think most of the time people have
chosen to stay in place and try to isolate themselves within the facilities. And many of the owner operators are
taking measures to help care for the residents by separating them by floors based on whether they're – they've
tested positive or not. But there's really no other place, in many cases, for these folks to go. And so, they stay
where they are. And so, we haven't really seen any material change in occupancy rates as of last week.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q

is?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
I think it's hard to give an exact number because it varies by facility type and by geography. The one thing, I
guess, we do know is we've seen at an industry level some of the occupancy rates come down just as new builds
came online. But that's an industry where those rates move up and down. And the operators are pretty savvy
about being able to absorb capacity. So, we haven't seen anything yet where there is an issue with the facilities'
ability to maintain occupancy rates above their breakeven.

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Hey, John, how are you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
All right. Just regarding the reserve and the addition you made this quarter, can you just give us a little bit of color
on your through-cycle loss assumption that you baked in to come up with that addition to the reserve? I know the
Fed has you at about $6 billion or 6.7% in the 2018 DFAST. Your company run was about 3.7% or about $3
billion. So, how are you thinking about that? What's a fair through-cycle loss number, and did you run your 2020
analysis yet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
We haven't run the 2020 – or updated it since the stress test and the CCAR submission. If you think about the
CECL and how it works, you've got a reasonable and supportable period, right, which is a couple of years. And
then, after that, you revert to the long-term average of the portfolio. And so, there's a little bit of a difference
between CECL and its calculation of losses versus what the stress test might be in addition to the assumptions
made in the stress test about, well, one, how severe it is and how long it is. But so far, the assumptions in CECL
would have been almost as severe, although not quite, but certainly not as long. And so there's a change that
may or may not happen depending on how the economy restarts. I guess, we'll see as we go. But those would be
the big factors that would be different between those two.
I guess the thing that – we focus is much or more on what we know to be the quality of the portfolio and the
quality of the credits that underlie it. And when you look at the CCAR results, you look at our DFAST, which you
mentioned, we are lower than the Fed under stress, and our actual losses in the last crisis were lower than that.
And when we think about our reserving, we're obviously adjusting it and taking into account the latest information
about what's going on in the economy, but we're also looking at the portfolio and what's happening in the portfolio.
And it's so far very, very early on to understand how the impact of the stimulus is going to work, how quickly the
restart is going to impact the portfolio.
But just looking at loss coverage, over the average of the last five years, the loss coverage in the allowance is
about seven times what the charge-offs have been. And our peak losses, as a percentage of loans, in the last
crisis was 1%. And so there's lots of different ways to kind of triangulate and figure out whether or not you feel
reasonable with the reserve. And based on the assumptions that we used, we felt comfortable with the
combination of those Moody's scenarios that we talked about. We looked at the quality of the portfolio and how it's
performing so far and the history, and looked at the ratios along a number of those dimensions. And based on
where we sit right now, we feel comfortable with it, and if the outlook changes, then we'll update that at the end of
the next quarter.

potential likelihood of a cut, or do you think it's fair where it stands right now? Thanks.

Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Sure. It's interesting how our conversations about our dividend change through time. It wasn't that long ago that
33% payout ratio didn't seem like very large. And we kept saying, one day the world will change, and it will be
good to have a lower payout ratio. So, we start from a good spot in terms of the payout ratio.
When you look at the PPNR to assets, the ratio of PPNR that we generate compared to the average is at the high
end, if not amongst the high end, certainly amongst our peer group. And we expect that to continue in the short
term. And our capital ratio is even at 9.2%, assuming we don't do any repurchases, is only going to go up. And we
have 220 basis points of distance between us and where we would believe we would be under the stress capital
buffer framework.
And so for now, we feel pretty good that we're generating earnings and have the capital that we need to be able to
support lending to creditworthy customers in our community. And so, for now, we feel like it's sustainable. And I'll
remind you that we worked really hard to make sure it was sustainable through the last crisis as well.

Just curious about the levels of – Darren, if you could just talk a little bit more about the levels of deferment you're
seeing, specifically on the commercial side, and if you think about some of those buckets of concern, like
restaurant. Just curious where restaurant and your hospitality portfolio is in terms of total deferments at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Yeah. Just going to get a little more detail on, if I got it by industry. Now, when I look at the work that we've done
so far, as you might expected, the deferrals in the commercial book, first, they skew towards the small business
customer just because of the numbers. And when you look in there, it's disproportionately restaurants, hotels and
parts of the economy that are related to activity and people being out and about.
The other thing, though, that's important to keep in mind is when I also look through the distribution of industries
that were accessing PPP and were funded through the PPP program, it reflects a very similar distribution in terms

of the types of customers that are receiving funds under that program. It would skew towards restaurants, it would
skew towards hospitality and hotels and the like, as well as some of the construction that's been shut down.
And so, when we look at the deferrals that have happened so far, what's interesting, at least to me, is that there is
lots of folks, both in consumer and in commercial, who have asked for deferrals, but have not actually exercised it.
And so, just to give you an example, within the mortgage portfolio, about a-third actually made their April
payments.
When we look at some parts of the real estate book, in the multifamily space, our customers are reporting that
anywhere between 75% and 90% depending on the type of property of the rental payments were made by
customers in April, and many of those would have sought some kind of deferral. And so, a lot of these programs
were implemented and mandated by various state authorities, and people took advantage or at least took the time
to call and say, I want you to know that I've been impacted by COVID, so that if they choose to take advantage of
the deferral or the payment relief that they're okay doing it and there won't be any issues with credit reporting and
the like. But in the first month, we were quite pleased and pleasantly surprised with the number of payments that
were actually made.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Okay. And just as a follow-up on the PPP program, just wondering how you're thinking about that from – in terms
of customers versus – I mean, I would imagine you guys have your hands full with prioritizing customers, but if
there is a second round, would you open that up to non-customers as well, if you could just maybe talk about how
you're thinking about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Sure. We're hopeful that there will be a second round because, obviously, it was in high demand by business
customers around the country and a very helpful program. We are in business to help all the customers in our
communities, whether they're actual customers today or future ones. I think one of the things that maybe is a little
misunderstood around the industry with relation to whether you look at customers or non-customers, wasn't to say
we prefer customers over non, but more to be able to get the money in the hands of folks more quickly, because
of AML/BSA and know your customer processes, it was much easier to expedite your existing customers because
those checks were already done and that you'd already done those verifications. And, therefore, you could
process them more quickly and had a better chance of helping them get access to the PPP early on.
And if the amount gets increased or Congress passes an additional amount of stimulus, I suspect you will see that
more non-customers might look to access funds around the country. But I think the SBA and the Fed did a good
job setting up as many banks as possible to be able to provide access for their customers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Joseph Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies
Okay. And do you have any expectations, just final question on, on how much of the PPP would be – will
ultimately be forgiven in the – over the next couple of months as opposed to remaining on the books for a longer
period of time, perhaps up to two years?

Frank, that's the million-dollar question. It's – I think – I guess – we were pleased that the way the program was
set up provided an opportunity for there to be forgiveness and that it was designed in a way to keep as many
businesses as possible open and running and with people employed. And so, I would expect that, that as many
companies as could demonstrate that they met the criteria for forgiveness that they would choose to try and
improve that and take advantage of that.
How quickly they're able to do it? I can't handicap. But it seems very unlikely to me that a significant percentage
will last the full two years, right? And how many will prepay or seek forgiveness after three months, six months,
nine months, I think it's really tough to handicap, which is part of the reason why forecasting balances going
forward and forecasting the margin going forward is so difficult just because it's really tough to figure out what
might happen.
And again, depending on where those customers were and which parts of the country and how quickly those
parts of the country restart, I think we'll have a big impact on what percentage of those customers seek and
receive forgiveness and over what time period.

Steven Alexopoulos Q

I want to ask you on the margin. So, just given the sharp move down in interest rates we've seen, what's the new
money yield today on loans and securities and loans will be ex-PPP?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Well – so while the rates have come down, what you've seen is spreads have widened. And so, when you think
about the cost of funding for the banks, while it's down in absolute, the spread that we have to pay is a little bit
higher. So, when you think about yields, you're probably seeing a little bit of an increase in the spread to the
benchmark, or the reference rate was probably in the low 200s, high-100s as we entered the year.
You're probably seeing things in the range of 50 basis points to 70 basis points wider on new money coming in
right now. But obviously, that varies a lot depending on the collateral and the loan to values and the industry. But
the absolute yield for the customers, from their perspective, even though the spreads might be a little bit wider, is
certainly coming down.

Well, securities or whatever market is, we don't anticipate adding a lot of securities in this environment just
because of the impact that it can have on AOCI as rates go up. And when we look at the yield we get holding it in
– at the Fed, it's not much different than what we can invest in. And so, just given the uncertainty of the cash flows
and how long they might be around, we'll tend to hold them more overnight while we wait for things to settle down.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Nomura Instinet
Hi. Good morning. You guys disclosed that 90% of your commercial loans and leases were secured at the end of
last year. Can you discuss how you're thinking about the value of the underlying collateral today relative to history
given the unique nature of the pandemic? More specifically, I'm curious whether you can frame how sensitive you
think collateral values would be to either a more extended period of social distancing, or just what that sensitivity
is? Any color around that would be great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Sure. Obviously, the – in many cases, the value of the collateral is directly a function of the underlying business
operations, right? So, if you think about a hotel and the value of the property, it's as much a function of its ability to
generate cash flow from occupancy. And so the value of that collateral in the short-term drops, but its ultimate
long-term value will be a function of how that particular geography rebounds from the pandemic and how quickly
the occupancy rates come up.
And the other thing that you'll find is – and we found in the last crisis is, when these values start to drop and
people are stressed, new money comes into the system and buys up those properties. Many of our customers are
sitting on cash and hoping that some of these properties' values come down because they'll see it as an
opportunity to get good quality assets at a low price. And so, there does tend to be a bit of a floor on many of
these things, particularly the real estate assets.
And so, I guess the thing that is tricky is, in the short term, there could be an immediate reaction. But in the short
term, people don't have cash flow problems. It takes them a while to burn through their cash. And then like we
said, they access these various programs to bridge them and get them through, and then we see how quickly they

come up and what we need to do to keep them going. And so, when we stress the portfolio, we'll stress LTVs and
see what happens with their cash flow and the impact that has on LTVs, and we'll stress their debt service
coverage ratio. And we'll look at how far their income has to fall or rates have to go up or any of the above to look
at their debt service coverage ratios.
And then, when we – we put those two together. And historically, when we've looked at the portfolios and we put
those two things together, we found that a very small percentage of our customers and outstanding dollars are
really challenged and severely stressed when both of those things happen together. And so, we've got certain
parts of the portfolio that are impacted more than others based on the pandemic. And then within that, there is
different geographies that are impacted differently, and then customer-specific situations that are impacted. And
so, it's always a work in progress to figure out what the loan to values might be at any given time.
The good news is that it takes a while for the losses and for these challenges to emerge. And so, what's
interesting is the pace of information around society has gotten really fast, but the pace of change in terms of how
these things flow through the economy and impact businesses isn't quite as fast.
And so, it's going to take a while for this to work its way through the system and through the portfolios before you
get into a situation where you're really relying on collateral values to try and bail you out. But as you've heard from
us before, when we look at many of our statistics about loan to values in our commercial portfolios, they're very
low. When we look at loan – value to loan, they get even lower. And so, from where we sit today, we feel like
we've got a lot of room to be able to protect ourselves. But really, that's a last resort. Our first resort is to work with
clients to keep them in business, because that's the best outcome for everybody.

Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
It's – the – I'm hesitating, Peter, not because I'm dodging the question, but more it's the impact of PPP and how
that offsets the impact of the decreased margin against the loan growth, right? And so, some of the loan growth

we saw at the end of the quarter was really nice. We'll see how long those lines remain drawn, but those will
create some net interest income in the second quarter compared to the first, maybe helps minimize some of the
decrease.
And then, the other question is those PPP loans. Adding $6.5 billion of principal balance is helpful to net interest
income. I mean, even though the yield is low, there are some other fees associated with it, and then we get to the
question of how long they stay, and then we'll have a full quarter impact of LIBOR on the other side and its
impact.
So, absent PPP, net interest income is probably moving down, although not quite at the same rate as margin
might be just because of the loan balance growth, and then you add on the – whatever your estimate is of PPP on
top of that and how long those loans actually stay on the balance sheet.

Yeah. So, residential is going to see more activity. I think the commercial business – a lot of the way it works is
the pipelines take a while to build, and so the second quarter pipeline will be – or fees will be a function of how the
pipeline was before the economic activity slowed down in the stay-at-home orders or shelter-in-place orders came
into effect, how quickly things start up, how construction comes online, how many people try to take advantage of
rates will be a function of where they are in the back half of the year. And so, we would expect the commercial
business from a mortgage perspective to be a little tougher, probably won't be near what it was last year, which –
the third quarter last year was a record quarter for us.
On the consumer side, I think the refinancing activity continues, especially with rates where they are. You haven't
seen the rates come down for customers as much as they have in the market just because many of the servicers
struggle with adjusting the underwriting and staffing to meet demand. And so a lot of times, what happens is the
price gets impacted to manage demand. And so you'll see a little bit of benefit in gain on sale there. The other
thing that's a little bit of a question is how many people are in some kind of payment deferral or payment relief,
because it would be tougher for them to qualify for a refinance when they're under that situation. And so, that will
take some people off the table right away, but it will keep the mortgage servicing business a little bit longer. And
so, I would think that, overall the cash flows there would be more secure and potentially have some more upside
as people look to refi and you get the gain on sale component of that. And I would expect that the – the gain on
sale margins will stay elevated for at least a little while longer just because of the ability to get folks on the phones
and able to handle the volume that's coming in.
When you get to the trust lines or some of the other fees, when you look at some of the other fees and kind of the
service charge category, you'll see the impact of interchange and slower economic activity there, as people are
out doing less things and drawing on their account less often, you'll see the instance of NSF come down. That
tends to be an activity-driven fee. And so, you see a decrease there.
And then, you've got the impact of the equity markets on assets under management and those fees. And then
depending on how long rates stay low, you've got the impact on the money market mutual fund fees, and not
charging there and subsidizing that.
So, on the funds, maybe it's $10 million a quarter kind of impact. If you look at the equity markets, maybe the
same kind of thing. And then when you think about the other fees, you're probably in the $15-million-ish a quarter,
$20 million a quarter, something like that.

Hi. I know you said it was early on credit, so I want to recognize that. But I wonder if you could just speak to
geography. Unfortunately, New York City and Westchester are kind of ground zero for the virus, and they're big
markets for you. As you look out over the next year, and again recognizing the uncertainty, but do you expect a
materially different credit performance here in New York versus the rest of your footprint?

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2020
Darren J. King A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, M&T Bank Corp.
Sure. So, I guess, if you look at New York City, we got to break down the different components of what sits in
New York City and what percentage of the portfolio it is. If you look in the hotel space, it's about 20% of the
portfolio. And obviously, it's completely shut down, and then there's not a lot of tourism happening there right now.
But if you look at those properties and the value of those properties, we would expect those to hold up pretty well
through time. They might drop, but the likelihood that they drop below our loan-to-value for any extended period of
time, we don't see as a high probability right now.
When you think about the multifamily portfolio, I'll go back to where we talked about payments that were made by
renters in April, and that the rates of people paying their rent were quite high from kind of 75% of the payments
coming in and maybe our average building in terms of quality, if you were to pitch it that way, the higher end
buildings, we're seeing payment rates of more in the 90% range. And so, we would expect those folks to stay in
good position.
We've mentioned a number of times just about the relationships we have in New York and how long they are and
how liquid those customers tend to be that those are the ones that oftentimes in these environments would see
opportunity as much as they see risk and would look to be buyers as opposed to sellers.
And then when I mentioned some of the retail in New York City, you'll see in retail probably be the hardest hit
there and that the rental rates for High Street properties on Madison Avenue and Fifth Ave., they've been under
pressure for a while. And so, this probably resets those rates lower. But in many cases, when we look at our
properties in Manhattan where it might get classified as retail because of what those rates had been, many of
those, if not all of those properties have multiple floors above the first floor retail space, and they would have
office or some residential or mixed use. And the cash flow that comes from the upper floors is enough to sustain
the property if retail is vacant or is challenged. And so, we feel pretty good that we've got the cash flow covered at
least in the short term, and totally understandable why New York City is a question.
Obviously, given our position there, we pay a lot of attention to it and are in constant contact with the customer
base. And it's because of that, that I was able to quote some of those numbers about the rent payments that we're
seeing, and so we're on top of it. And based on what we can see right now, are confident that the portfolio will be
solid like we saw in the last crisis.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2020
Good. Thank you. Obviously, many of us have been around for a while covering this industry, and we recall back
in the S&L crisis that the government got involved and trying to facilitate [ph] in solving first being required
(01:06:52) by healthy savings banks which ended up turning into a disaster for those savings banks. We've then,
of course, a TARP in 2008, 2009, where the government changes the rules on paying back TARP, having to raise
capital.
How can you reassure us, if you can, that the government's not going to change the rules on all these lending
programs next year sometime and actually work against the banks in some shape, some form? I know it's –
nobody's planning on that, but can you put in any safeguards to try to insulate yourself from something like that?

Boy, Gerard, you're dark today. You got to get out of the place.

There you go.

Go take a walk or something. I guess, right now, our first priority is trying to help customers and make sure that
we use the programs as we believe they were intended to try and put the money in the hands of our customers to
try and keep them open and running and to help keep employment as high as it can be or paychecks flowing, and
to help stimulate the economy to make the impact of this pandemic as low as possible for our customers and our
employees and our communities.
If you look at the programs that are out there, many of the programs are repeats from last time. If you look at the
[indiscernible] (01:08:19) program, or you look at the commercial paper program, or you look at many of the other
programs, they are repeats and have a outcome that's known.
So far, we haven't heard anything about TARP or the likes of TARP. And I think if you look at the outcome of the
last crisis and you look at the stress test and you look at the capital levels in the industry and amongst us and the
peers, we're all starting from a great place. When you look at liquidity, which banks are not that difficult, you either
fail or survive because of liquidity and capital. And so, capital is in a good place and liquidity so far is in a good
place. And when you think about the moves that everyone is making to preserve both liquidity and capital, I think
we're starting from a good place. And so, the industry's need to rely on some of these programs, like we had to in
the last crisis or some of the other ones that you mentioned, is a little bit less.
I think as an industry as these programs are being developed by Congress and by the Fed, we're being asked for
input and we're trying to help provide input to make sure that the programs are structured in a way that make
them most beneficial to the customer and so that we can help facilitate them.
I think this PPP program, other than some of the operational and procedural hiccups that happened, is actually a
really good program and in that it was thoughtful in that it was designed to be relatively low documentation, but
you have to show that you are covering operating expenses, so it was designed to keep you in business. With the
SBA guarantee behind it, it should be helpful and then with the forgiveness for the outside world. I guess,
probably the thing that if – if you're going to be cynical and worried, you would worry about the documentation

aspect of the PPP program and whether there's a change of heart and how that's looked at, I think you could
argue that some of the FHA programs and documentation became a bit of a bugaboo for the industry last time
around.
But I think that's also partly why you saw some banks, us included, not rush out when the program became final
on Thursday night, that Thursday, but go out on Monday so that we could take the time to make sure we had a
very good process where we could put the documentation in place. And one of the key components of that was
BSA/AML.
And so, I think there's a lot that the industry has learned to try and protect ourselves from those types of things.
We're in a better starting place. And at this time – this isn't a financial crisis. This is driven by something else. And
so, hopefully, some of the relationship, we'll call it, between the banking system and Washington isn't at a place
that it was in some of those other circumstances where you'd see a change of heart. But I don't want to be overly
Pollyanna and say that a change in administration in November could change all that, too. So, it's something I
think we all got to keep an eye on. But I think we're starting from a better place and are in a more thoughtful place
than we would have been as an industry going into the last crisis.

Real quickly, I had one question e-mailed to me asking about the bifurcation of the allowance at March 31,
consumer versus commercial. I believe that the number we disclosed that with the adoption of CECL was 55%
commercial, 45% consumer. It would be a little – couple -- maybe one or two points higher than that today, but not
materially different. Again, thank you all for participating today. And as always, if you have clarification of any
items on the call or the news release is necessary, please reach out to our Investor Relations department at area
code 716-842-5138. Thank you, and goodbye.
