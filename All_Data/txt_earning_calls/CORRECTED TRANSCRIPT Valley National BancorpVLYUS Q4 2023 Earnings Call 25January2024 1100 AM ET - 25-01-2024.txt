Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Thank you, Travis. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Valley reported net income of $72 million and earnings per share
of $0.13. Exclusive of non-core items, including the one-time special FDIC assessment tied to the [ph] year's bank
failures (00:01:38), adjusted net income and EPS were $116 million and $0.22, respectively. While I'm pleased
with the quarter's balance sheet trends, I'm disappointed with the earnings and profitability metrics, which I will
discuss shortly.
On the positive side, we made progress enhancing C&I growth while curtailing commercial real estate or
originations. This enabled us to both accrete organic capital and reduce funding needs. On the deposit side, we
added a remarkable 14,000 net new consumer households and 8,000 net new commercial deposit relationships
during the year. This represents 4.5% growth in consumer households and 10.5% growth in commercial
relationships from the same period a year ago. The ongoing addition of new deposit clients is critical as it directly
relates to Valley's franchise value and our future earnings potential.
Our new customer growth was broad based across all of our geographies and I might add, was undertaken
against the backdrop of a difficult external environment when mid-sized banks like Valley were too often front
page news. During the quarter, our new relationships helped to generate strong customer deposit inflows, which
enabled us to significantly reduce our reliance on broker deposits. While customer deposit inflows were
exceptional, the organization-like focus on ensuring a successful core conversion in October likely led us to take
our eyes off the ball relative to deposit pricing. There is no doubt that this negatively impacted net interest income
during the quarter. And in a few minutes, Mike will illustrate some of the subsequent efforts that we have
undertaken to manage these deposit costs going forward.
From a strategic perspective, we are refocusing on holistic customer profitability and will return to pricing deposits
in consideration of balance and return as opposed to just balance. The quarter was also impacted by a few
additional factors worth calling out. First, [ph] waived (00:03:44) service charges and proactive efforts taken to
supplement customer support both associated with our core conversion weighed on quarterly earnings by an
estimated amount equaling approximately $0.01 per share. These efforts were enacted out of an abundance of
caution to ensure that our customer experience smoothly transitioned to our new system. I'm pleased with the
customer response to our core conversion, but acknowledge that some of the amounts of the excess support
costs will persist in the first quarter as well.
Secondly, our provision was partially elevated as a result of a loan charge-off in our commercial premium finance
business. The after tax impact of the associated provision was approximately $0.01 per share as well. This
business line has approximately $275 million in outstanding balances. And we have an agreement in place to sell
this business. And the portion of the outstanding loans at what is expected to be a modest premium during the
first quarter of 2024. While this quarter's earnings are not satisfactory, I continue to believe that our strategic
progress over the last few years positioned us well in the evolving banking landscape. The financial consistency
that we have achieved in support of this strategic evolution is evident in our tangible book value growth results.
Our stated tangible book value has increased 52% since 2018, which is more than double our proxy peers at
25%. Our value creation, as measured by tangible book value plus the dividends we have paid out, totaled 90%

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
since 2018, or more than 1.7 times our proxy peer median of 53%. From a balance sheet perspective, we have
successfully transformed and diversified our funding base.
At the end of 2017, approximately 92% of our deposits were held in our branch network. By utilizing technology to
expand our delivery channels and establishing new growth-oriented deposit verticals, we have reduced our
reliance on branch deposits to just 65% today. From a geographic perspective, 78% of our total deposits were in
the northeast branches in 2017. Today, that number is down to just 45% of total deposits. Our focus on
geographic diversity and holistic relationship banking has benefited the asset side of our business as well. In
2017, 78% of our total loan portfolio was in New Jersey and New York. That composition has declined to just 55%
today. In 2014, we entered Florida with the acquisition of First United Bank, which had just over $1 billion in loans.
Through additional strategic acquisitions and targeted organic efforts in this dynamic growth-oriented market, our
Florida loan portfolio has expanded beyond $12 billion. There continue to be significant and diverse commercial
growth opportunities available to us in Florida and across our entire footprint.
The proactive evolution of our technology infrastructure is less tangible but equally significant achievement for our
organization. We have recruited and developed a strong pool of technology talent, which has helped us to
modernize our infrastructure and positions us to be on the leading edge of further advancements in the banking
space. Our technology adoption has allowed us to scale the franchise with limited net head count growth. Since
2018, we have nearly doubled our asset base from $32 billion to $61 billion, with a near 17% increase in head
count. Our recent core conversion align technology across our company and provides additional capabilities
which we look forward to leveraging for our clients. As we move past the conversion, we anticipate that further
efficiencies will also emerge. We have also focused on enhancing a more uniform data infrastructure, which
allows us to react quickly and purposefully to changing market dynamics. [ph] An internal AI working group
(00:07:52) has been established to help us determine appropriate potential use cases and to begin to execute on
related opportunities.
I now want to pivot to our strategic imperatives for the coming year. While none of these are new initiatives for
Valley, we continue to believe that they will drive shareholder value over the long time. First, we need to continue
to drive core deposits to the bank. We have an incredible service-oriented branch network across our dynamic
geographic footprint, which generate more consumer and commercial activity out of these locations in 2024. As
the curve increasingly normalizes, we will further leverage the existing specialty niches that we have established
and will build on our momentum for the second half of 2023.
Secondly, we will continue to deemphasize investor commercial real estate lending in favor of C&I and owner-
occupied CRE. We have restructured our commercial banking organization to better align expertise and
experience with opportunities in our markets and business lines. Our enhanced treasury management capabilities
and product offerings will support expanded wallet share among our customer base and help us to acquire new
customers on the commercial side. We have also adjusted our incentive programs in support of our deposit
gathering and lending goals, which will drive further strategic alignment across the entire organization.
Finally, we will continue to grow our differentiated non-interest income businesses to diversify our revenue base.
Through organic and acquisitive efforts, we have developed a robust suite of fee income products and service
offerings for our growing customer base. The recent enhancements of our treasury management offering will help
to offset certain capital market headwinds associated with lower swap-related revenues in 2024. The industry
challenges of the past year confirmed to me that we have undertaken the right long-term strategy. And I'm
pleased with our ability to navigate this difficult year. 2024 will be about accelerating our progress towards
achieving our strategic initiatives and improving our performance as we continue to mature. As we execute on
these initiatives, I want to reiterate that we continue to prioritize tangible book value growth. We believe that
4

consistent growth in tangible book value will drive shareholder value over time. And we continue to expect to
outperform our peers on this metric.
With that, I will turn the call over to Tom and Mike to discuss the quarter's growth and financial results.

Thank you, Ira. On slide 6, you can see the quarter's deposit trends. Direct customer deposits increased
approximately $1.6 billion to largely offset the significant $2.3 billion reduction in indirect deposits. The meaningful
reduction in our reliance on wholesale deposits was a key highlight of the quarter. We generated strong growth in
our interest-bearing transaction accounts. And we're pleased by the slowdown in non-interest deposit runoff. That
said, we acknowledge that a competitive interest rate is one of the tools used to support our generation efforts
during the quarter. Still, the pace of deposit cost increase has slowed. And in a moment, Michael outlined efforts
which we have undertaken to control interest expense on a go-forward basis.
The next slide provides more detail on the composition of our deposit portfolio by delivery channel and business
line. Traditional branch deposits increased approximately $600 million during the quarter. This growth was spread
across our geographic footprint. Our specialty niches increased approximately $1 billion as well, with key
contributions from our online delivery channel and technology deposit team.
Turning to the next slide, you can see the continued diversity and granularity of our deposit base. No single
commercial industry accounts for more than 7% of our deposits. Our government portfolio remains diversified
across our footprint and is fully collateralized relative to state collateral requirements.
Slide 9 provides an overview of our loan growth and portfolio composition. At the top left, you can see the
proactive growth slowdown which occurred throughout 2023. Ultimately, we achieved the low end of the 7% to 9%
growth target that we had laid out at the start of the year. Annualized loan growth slowed consistently as the year
progressed, illustrating our ability to be responsive to changing market dynamics.
The following slide breaks down our commercial real estate portfolio by collateral type and geography. As a
reminder, we have an extremely granular loan portfolio which is well-diversified by collateral type and geography.
Our debt service coverage and loan to value metrics remain very attractive. We continue to closely monitor pools
of maturing and resetting loans, and believe that our borrowers are well-positioned to absorb the passthrough of
higher rates. This reflects consistent underwriting discipline at conservative cap rates and significant stress testing
efforts at origination.
The next two slides provide additional details around our multifamily and office portfolios. From a multifamily
perspective, our $8.8 billion portfolio includes $2 billion of co-op loans with an extremely low loan to value.
Exclusive of our co-op portfolio, our Manhattan multifamily exposure is a mere $600 million, which you can see in
the last column of the table. The remainder of the portfolio is well-diversified across our footprint, with low average
loan sizes and attractive loan to value and debt service coverage ratio metrics.
With that, I will turn the call over to Mike Hagedorn to provide additional insight into the quarter's financials.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
Thank you, Tom. Slide 13 illustrates Valley's recent quarterly net interest income and margin trends. While end of
period non-interest-bearing deposits stabilized, the decline in non-interest deposits on an average basis weighed
on quarterly net interest income by approximately $4 million. Throughout the quarter, we replaced maturing direct
and indirect CDs with relatively high yielding interest-bearing transaction accounts and promotional retail CDs,
which was the cost of our significant customer deposit growth during the quarter.
The right side of this page outlines efforts that have been undertaken to more precisely manage our funding costs
on a go-forward basis. We have cut back the high yield savings rate in our online channel but remained
competitive. We have also significantly reduced our one-year CD rate, which will help to mitigate the repricing
issue that we faced during the recent quarter. Finally, we are working with our relationship bankers to ensure that
deposit rates are reasonable in the context of holistic customer profitability. In the few quarters following the
industry's challenges in March, we priced deposit products to ensure that [ph] direct (00:15:25) customer balances
rebounded. As we continue to move past these challenges, we will price products with a more even consideration
of balances and profitability.
Turning to the next slide, you can see that non-interest income on an adjusted basis was generally stable from the
third quarter of 2023. Deposit service charges declined sequentially as we waived certain transactional fees
around the time of our core conversion. Other than this, growth trends were relatively strong for the quarter
despite the headwind of swap revenues.
On the following slide, you can see that our non-interest expenses were approximately $340 million for the
quarter. Adjusting for our $50 million FDIC special assessment and [ph] certain other (00:16:14) non-recurring
litigation and merger charges, non-interest expenses were approximately $273 million on an adjusted basis.
Compensation costs continue to be very well-controlled. The sequential expense increase was primarily due to
higher traditional FDIC assessment costs, consulting costs, occupancy, and advertising expenses, and the
seasonal uptick in other business development expenses.
A portion of the quarter's expense increase was associated with certain consulting and customer support
initiatives associated with our core system conversion in October. While the customer experience associated with
our conversion has been extremely positive, some of these costs will have a tail into the first quarter. As you
know, the first quarter also has traditional seasonal headwinds associated with payroll taxes. We are very pleased
with our ability to proactively control head count and associated compensation expenses throughout 2023. We
expect that 2024 will be a more normal year in terms of expense trajectory. And as you will see shortly, we
anticipate mid-single-digit expense growth in the coming year.
Slide 16 illustrates our asset quality trends for the last five quarters. While non-accrual loans ticked up somewhat
during the quarter, they remain relatively flat on a year-over-year basis. Net charge-offs were $17 million during
the quarter and included approximately $5 million associated with our commercial premium finance business,
which is under an agreement to sell during the first quarter of the year. As a result of our higher provision, our
allowance for credit losses for loans increased 1 basis point during the quarter to 0.93% of total loans.
The next slide illustrates the sequential increase in our tangible book value and capital ratios. Tangible book value
increased nearly 2% from the third quarter of 2023 and benefited from a reduction in the OCI impact associated
with our available for sale securities portfolio. We are pleased that during the year, we were able to support our
strong loan growth and organically accrete regulatory capital. Based on our expected loan growth in 2024, we
would anticipate this trend to continue.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
We lay out our expectations for the coming year on slide 18. We anticipate generating mid-single-digit loan growth
with a focus on C&I and non-investor commercial real estate in 2024. Based on consensus interest rate
expectations for 2024, we would anticipate net interest income growth between 3% and 5%. Non-interest income
should grow between 5% and 7% on an annual basis as headwinds in our swap business are more than offset by
continued scale in our wealth, insurance, and tax advisory businesses, as well as our recently enhanced treasury
management capabilities. Non-interest expenses should grow approximately in line with revenue. Higher FDIC
costs and inflationary pressures are offset by savings from our core conversion and the continued benefits of our
previously announced expense initiatives. Factoring this guidance together, we expect 2024 EPS to come in just
slightly lower than the existing 2024 consensus estimate of $1.08.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to begin Q&A. Thank you.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Frank Schiraldi of Piper
Sandler. Your line is open. Frank, your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co. (Broker)
Sorry. Just on the NII guide, I recognize you guys follow the market on the forward curve here. And most of those
rate – assumed rate cuts are backloaded in the year. What sort of annualized basis or annualized pickup do you
get in terms of either NII or NIM from a given 25 basis point [ph] cut (00:20:46)? What's the assumption?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
So I want to make sure I understand the question. You want to know what, just the [ph] NIM (00:20:55) impact
would be of a single 25 basis point increase? Okay, I'm sorry.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co. (Broker)
Yeah. Basically, as you get – if we get three or four cuts, I mean, I'm just trying to assume or get a sense of what
25 basis points does for – on average for the NIM or NII in your modeling.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
So I'm going to direct you back to our guidance, around 3% to 5%. So what we're expecting right now in 2024 is
roughly 175 basis points that will affect most of the short end of the curve as you get less inversion in the curve.
And that first increase does start in the end March. You don't get much in the first quarter. But you are correct.
They are more backloaded on the cuts into the fourth quarter of 2024. So I'm not prepared to answer your
question on what is exactly a 25 basis point cut, because it's going to depend upon the mix of the funding sources
at that time. For the full year, we're expecting 3% to 5% increase in NII. And that should drive a slightly higher
NIM year-over-year.

And Frank, conceptually, we're relatively neutrally positioned to the short end of the curve. So there's not a
significant move based on – if those cuts don't materialize. We're much more exposed to the longer end as it
impacts the benefit that we'll get as our fixed rate loans mature and reprice.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co. (Broker)
Okay. So I guess over the full curve, you're still liability sensitive but more neutral to the front end?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yes. That's correct.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co. (Broker)
Okay. Okay. And just kind of a – I don't know, more theoretical question in terms of – the business mix has
changed a bit here over the years with specialized deposit opportunity, the opportunity on the C&I side, which you
guys continue to see in 2024. In a more normally sloped yield curve, what do you think sort of a normal sort of
margin is, a normalized sort of NIM is for Valley in the way you've built the balance sheet here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. This is Ira. I think it's a lot higher. I mean, obviously being in an inverted curve for three years, running the
balance sheet in which we do, where we try to take as much of a neutral stance as we can, it's a real challenging
environment for us. That said, as the curve does get to a more normalized focus, we do anticipate significant
margin expansion as we get back to in an appropriate environment. We've done a really good job shifting the
commercial growth within the organization. We've been running a 10% CAGR on C&I growth for an extended
period of time. And as you mentioned, the diversification of the funding base really will help us, as that curve gets
a little bit more normal and we can get back to an appropriate deposit pricing approach across the organization.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co. (Broker)
Okay. Great. And then, if I could just sneak in one last one on that kind of front. In terms of specialized deposits
coming on board in the quarter, the growth there, and just thinking through the betas on your deposit book, the
specialized versus the deposits in the branch, does – are the betas expanding here given the national
businesses? And would that help you – obviously help you maybe to [ph] a greater degree (00:24:29) in a down
rate environment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
I mean, those definitely have a bit of a higher beta in some of those national businesses. And I think that refers
back to what Travis said, that it's going to be a bit more neutral when we have some of that curve impacted right
off the bat. I think the mix shift from out of non-interest-bearing really impacted us during the course of the year,
so that's changed a little bit of the asset liability, right. So we do have more sensitivity on the downside on the
deposit costs [ph] than (00:24:59) when we were running 28% to 29% non-interest-bearing deposits, as those are
now sitting in interest-bearing deposits. So that is going to be a benefit to us.

But I think as you really mentioned, it's the diversity and the granularity that sits within that deposit book that we're
really excited about and what the opportunity is. As we mentioned earlier on the call, I think deposit pricing
definitely got a little bit away from us as we were focused more on the core conversion. That said, I do believe it's
an easy fix. And we'll – we will focus on it and make sure that 2024 gets back to results that you would expect
from us.

Operator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Moss of Raymond
James. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning. I'm just following up here on the asset liability side of the business. Just curious with regard to how
much of your fixed rate loans and securities reprice in 2024.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah, Steve. So the – we've talked in the past, we have $20 billion of fixed rate loans. It's not necessarily linear.
So we have more of our fixed rate loans repriced in the second half of the year than they do in the first half. But in
total, it's between $3 billion and $4 billion that would reprice this year. But again, that's relatively back-loaded.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And then, on the security side, I'm assuming there's probably just minimal cash flows for the upcoming
year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. Duration of securities portfolio is extended to seven years give or take. We get – yeah, it's really de
minimis. It's a $5 billion portfolio to couple hundred million dollars in a year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And then, on credit here, just curious to get a little more color on the uptick in C&I and CRE [indiscernible]
(00:26:57). It sounds like some of it is from the premium finance that you charged off this quarter. But just kind of
curious as to what the loan types are and any incremental color you can give.

Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. Hey, Steve. It's Tom. There was an uptick in that non-accrual, primarily in the CRE business, $20 million.
$10 million of it has since been repaid. When you look at our performing past dues, you will see a decline on the
commercial side and very little, if any, in that 90-day bucket. The increase in the accruing past dues is on that
residential side. And the color on that, it's our jumbo on balance sheet portfolio, average loan-to-value of 58%. We
don't expect any loss. Historically, looking over a 15-year period, our real estate portfolio ran about 35% charge-
offs against our peer banks. We expect that trend to continue. We are seeing, really, improvement across the
board. Our metrics remain solid, especially on the commercial side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And just curious, I noticed in the text that you guys did refer to an uptick in classified assets. Just kind of
curious, where did criticized and classified assets end the quarter here?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
[ph] For the uptick (00:28:16) – Travis, you'll have the number. But the uptick, we do the forward review of all of
our loans, our total portfolio especially, looking early on in the year at the ones that are repricing or resetting.
There was a migration of those loans in the third quarter, primarily into that special mention category where they
might have fallen below or right at a [ph] 1 times debt service (00:28:36) coverage. I just want to remind everyone,
the loans that we repriced during 2023 and our review of 2024 reprice resulted in no modifications of any of the
contractual terms to the repayment. But Travis, if there is a different number that I'm not referring to?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President, Director-Corporate Finance & Business Development & Head-Investor Relations, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. I don't have that number in front of me. But I would say, in the third quarter, that stress test process that
Tom referenced resulted in a more significant increase in criticized and classified loans. Again, not an impression
that we would see additional losses, but just the way the debt service coverages shake out. In the fourth quarter,
it was a much more normal increase. So, it was not as significant.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
And this is Mike. That increase would have been [ph] obviously (00:29:17) in special mention credits, not the more
extreme ratings.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Got it. And maybe just following up to that point, as you're seeing some borrowers get close on debt service
coverage ratios, just curious to what color you can give around the work – whether it's a work-out process,
borrowers help – borrowers' ability to maybe pay down a loan, just kind of what you're seeing and what potential
NPA formations you could see here in 2024?

And again, we haven't had to modify any terms to those borrowers where we were repricing in the past year, year
and a half. Typically, our underwriting standards would start – we use a higher cap level than probably our peers
use. We underwrite to current cash flow. We don't underwrite to future cash flow. Our leverage tends to be lower
going in, our average loan-to-value on that real estate portfolio is about 60%, [ph] pretty across (00:30:15) all of
our asset classes. So there is flexibility. We do a lot of business with existing comfort – customers. They have the
wherewithal. If it's tight, we'll either get additional collateral, a pay down, or reserve to support any funding below
at an appropriate level.

I understand this isn't necessarily something you guys guide to, but I'm trying to understand some of the cadence
of kind of profitability around NIM and some of the expense targets and the rationalization, I think, which will start
to have a bigger benefit in the middle part of the year. Just – are you guys willing or able to just kind of
qualitatively talk about how you're thinking in the current budget about what the kind of return ROE profile will look
like as you exit 2024? I mean, it feels like the first half of the year might continue to be a little bit depressed, but
just wondering if you can kind of give any indications around that cadence relative to the guide that you provided.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President, Director-Corporate Finance & Business Development & Head-Investor Relations, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. I think your perspective, Mike, is pretty accurate. So, I think in the first quarter of the year, I mean, whether
it's on the expense side, the headwind of payroll tax or on the NII side, [ph] day count (00:32:04) and other things
and the lack of can change that's projected in the industry environment, we anticipate generally stable margin, I'd
say, in the first quarter, improving somewhat in the second quarter and then getting more expansion in third and
fourth quarter. That's kind of the way the budget is built now based on the implied forward curve. In terms of
expenses, I mean, we have – if you look back to last year, it was a $7 million pickup in the first quarter related to
payroll taxes. So you're looking at something similar there.
As we stand here in December, we've, on an annualized basis, got $20 million of expenses out related to the
head count reduction that was enacted in June. We think there is another $8 million or so, give or take, on an –
from an annualized perspective from further actions here in the first quarter on the personnel side. And then, as
we get into the second quarter and beyond, there should be some saves related to the core conversion, some of
these elevated costs that we've talked about with customer support efforts and other things.
So I think the first quarter, there will be some seasonal expense headwinds, but then you're looking at general
stability over the three quarters following. So – but we do think the profitability improves throughout the year.
When you blend it all together, again, in the midpoint of our range, you get to $1.4 to $1.5. That puts you at an
ROA level of – that I'd say similar to what we've achieved this year, but it does improve as the year goes on.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, it should kind of put you maybe in the 90s on the ROA on the exit. I guess, the question is, if
revenue to expense grow dollar for dollar, right, that's not going to really improve much? And I – that's kind of
what the outlook is for 2024. But, I guess, what kind of gives you confidence that in 2025 and beyond you guys
can get back into a more positive operating leverage territory and continue to see those improvements kind of
carry forward in 2025? I mean, is it just margin? Is there other kind of unit economics in some of the specialty
businesses that you're growing that will benefit from scale? Would love some additional color there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. I think there is a lot of opportunity for us. I think if you look at the net interest income side, right, sitting in an
inverted curve, hopefully, isn't one that we sit in for that much longer, but it definitely has an impact on us. I think
the core conversion is really understated as we think about what the ability to scale looks like for us. We changed
every single one of our clients into a new core platform across the entire organization. That said, we put in 261
different APIs sitting on top of that core conversion to think about what that client experience looks like.
You go into Valley, you open up a checking account in one of our branches, it's the exact same platform that you
do when you're opening up a digital account setting at Valley. So we're very smart, I think, in the approach that we
took as to how we were going to leverage the infrastructure and technology base. So, from a scalability
perspective for us, we're not paying per individual unit when we open up an individual account to a core provider
somewhere. We really have a technology infrastructure that's scalable here, that's focused on what that client
experience is going to look like, and will definitely drive outsized growth.
And when I talked about some of the commercial growth numbers and the consumer growth numbers, those are
household growth numbers, not in – not even [ph] individual (00:35:10) accounts. That was done during our core
12

conversion when everyone hated mid-sized banks. So I think there's a lot of positive tailwind that we have when
we think about what we're doing from a franchise value perspective. So I'm really excited about what I think the
opportunity is on the expense side of the book, but the revenue side is definitely going to begin to accelerate as
well.

Hey, guys.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
So we were hearing your question on loan growth, but it dropped out when you said [ph] we guide (00:41:25)...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah, no, no problem. And I was – it was more just asking – it's kind of same line of questioning, just the loan
growth, as you guys focus more kind of on pricing of customers and holistic kind of customer profitability, et
cetera, is there – is it fair to assume that the incremental loan growth and the customer loans that you're bringing
on, you guys would think with some of the deposit pricing changes, et cetera, will be coming on at better kind of
profit margins than they were in 2023? Or is there like a lag to some of those impacts? Or how should we think
about that dynamic?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas A. Iadanza A
President, Valley National Bancorp
We would – you should expect that our spreads on those will continue to widen and increase. And I'd give you a
little context around it. We have seen an uptick in that C&I pipeline and that business, it's probably 70% of what its
high point was and it represents 65% of our total portfolio. And it's across the [ph] old (00:42:23) business lines,
especially in our healthcare and fund banking lines. So we are starting to see the improvement and spreads are
holding.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Mike, really just adding to that. When you think about the compression we've seen in the margin is largely a
function, as we've talked about, some of the mix shift and some of the other repricing. As rates either stabilize,
which they seem to have, or go down, there really is going be a significant benefit to us. The [ph] new (00:42:46)
value margin that we put on is from 3.50% to 3.60%, which reflects the ability that we have from a pricing
perspective and how we're going about it from a profitability perspective.
The new loans that we put on, we've been able to bring on, equal amount of funding associated with that from a
client perspective. So [ph] it's not as (00:43:04) even if we're out of the brokered market. So once we do get some
stabilization, which we anticipate having on that mix shift, there really is upside for what that margin looks like
based on the fact that new – the new originations, as Tom mentioned, $2 billion came on at a spread of positive
3.50% for us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Helpful. And then, just I wanted to clarify something quick and I'll step back, which is, Mike, can you repeat – I just
want to make sure I heard it correctly. Just the rate assumptions in – baked into the NII guide around Fed funds.
And then, just to be clear, Travis, you're basically saying there, like on the short end, whether it's two cuts, three
cuts, four cuts, it doesn't actually have a huge impact to 2024, it's more of the long end and then some of the back
book and other dynamics that we've been discussing? Just want to make sure I heard that all right.

Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
That's correct. And while we haven't laid out specifically – and we expect the Fed to cut this amount on this date, I
can tell you the first rate cut that we anticipate is 25 basis points, but they accelerate as the year goes on. So we
get larger rate cuts in the third and fourth quarters. And again, the biggest benefit to us would be a lessening of
the inversion in the curve and a reduction in short-term interest rates. Hence, why we took the cost this quarter to
shorten our duration on our liabilities or just funding generally, as Tom talked about around the mix of our deposits
moving away from FHLB and some of our maturing where they were indirect or direct CDs that we had in the
fourth quarter to money market and transaction accounts. And that was all done purposefully to prepare the
balance sheet for the Fed cut.

Just follow-up on that, Mike, is that – the liability shortening, is that largely complete for you guys at this point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
It's largely complete. There is another big piece in the first quarter still to come. It was loaded – front-end loaded
because we were preparing for this when we were putting on these liabilities with duration going back to the first
quarter of last year. So there's another piece in the first quarter, and then after that it tails off quite a bit.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

on the CD repricing? And is this maturing liability piece, is that deposits as well or what is that and where can that
reprice?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
So the customer impact on it is yet to be seen, but I don't expect it to be extreme. So to be really clear about that
one year CD rate. The majority of the impact of that will be CDs that will roll. So if you remember from our
previous comments back in 2023, we put on several CD specials, most notably around a 13-month duration, and
now those things are rolling at 12 months; and so we're reducing the rolling.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A

[indiscernible] (00:46:24) average between70% to 80% retention of the CD's when we're in market. So I think
there should be a pretty big tailwind there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Good. Good. And then, Ira, it's kind of a margin question, but maybe not, but it feels like maybe the deposit
pricing pressure was a little bit more than you expected. But to me, I look at it and I think about the numbers and
maybe you were at the bottom of the margin. So curious on that and then also curious about the tradeoff decision
you talked about earlier about deposit growth against maybe some of the promotional pricing or things you did
together, new accounts and bring in deposits. Can you talk a little bit about that tradeoff decision that you guys
made?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
I think from a big picture perspective, there were a couple of variables. One, we made a conscious decision to go
shorter, right, on our liability side so we could have extended or kept it the same duration as we were having
before. But when we started to see some movement in November and sort of where the expectations were maybe
even a little bit earlier, where still the curve was on that short end, we definitely moved a little bit shorter. So that
definitely negatively impacted the interest expense for the quarter. We do think that there'll be a positive impact to
that though as we think about where 2024 comes out sort of for the full year period.
And that said, from a macro perspective, look, it was a very challenging year for an organization like ours. Looking
in the beginning of the year, what happened with Signature, what happened with SEB and the others. And we
were really focused on retention of deposits. And as a result of that, I think we were probably maybe too lenient
on some of our clients and acquiescing to some of their rate request. We had a lot of money that moved to
treasuries right off the bat. And that said, we were really competing with that.
Today, in the conversations we have with clients, I'm not so sure that we needed to necessarily do that. And we're
going back reengaging with our clients again. We're a bit distracted, I think, in the fourth quarter based just with
the core conversion and probably even in the third quarter even leading up to that core conversion. For us, getting
the core conversion done was important. We did it unbelievable. I had three email complaints, so that's it, from
16


Valley National Bancorp
(VLY) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
clients out of an entire client base. It's really nothing. So there was a lot of focus on retention of clients through
that core conversion.
Once again, now I just think we get back having appropriate conversations with our clients, appropriate
conversations when it comes what the pricing should look like. And we'll get the deposits back to an appropriate
beta as to what it should look like. But I think most importantly, we did an unbelievable core conversion. We
retained all of our clients. We actually grew clients through a core conversion, which doesn't even necessarily
happen. We put on, as I said, 10.5% household growth in commercial during this year. I mean, those are
unbelievable numbers. So while – once again, I said I'm not so happy with where the fourth quarter ended up; big
picture, I'm not that concerned.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Glenn Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. You shouldn't beat yourself up too much. It's not terrible. But just one more thing on net interest income. I
kind of asked this earlier, but it implies a decent step up your guide, like about $140 million incremental from the
run rate that you had in the fourth quarter. Do you guys think we're near the bottom or at the bottom on net
interest income at this point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
So we're certainly getting close. So let me do this. I'm going to direct everybody to slide 6 because I know that this
is a really important topic. And when you look at the quarter-over-quarter cost increase in deposits, you'll see that
we started off at 60 basis points, then we had two consecutive quarters at 49 basis points. In the third quarter and
the fourth quarter, it's only 19 basis points.
So why do we feel better about the direction of NIM? It's mainly that combined with the fact that we're starting to
see some stabilization in maybe in our noninterest-bearing accounts. That noninterest-bearing rotation, going
back to [indiscernible] (00:50:15) when we had 36% of our total funding sources in noninterest-bearing. That's
come down to 23% now and December we're starting to see some stabilization, and when you combine that with
the deceleration in the overall cost of deposits, that's why we feel like there's some additional increase in our NIM
as 2024 plays out. Obviously, we need Fed rate cuts to capture all of that opportunity.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Hey, Steven.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Ira, I want to start. So when you took over as CEO, one of your top priorities was improving the efficiency ratio,
right? And I know it was a rough year for everybody because of what happened with rates and NIM pressure,
etcetera. But when I look at the strategic imperatives for 2024, I'm very surprised. It felt like you moved the
goalpost a bit, that improving where we are is not on there. Is this still a top priority for you and should we expect
to see improvement this year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. Look. I think the contraction of what we saw in the efficiency ratio is largely just a function of the NIM,
Steven, right? And as we get back to better core funding, as we get back to some better diversification that sits
within that asset class, the NIM will definitely expand as a result of that. We're down – I think we were at 3,325
plus or minus employees when I took over. We're sitting around 3,700 today and we're $21 billion back then and
$60 billion today. And I think we've definitely focused on what the efficiency looks like. We've definitely embedded
technology in here. For me, it's not something that's even called out as a strategic imperative. It's just
[indiscernible] (00:52:14) the core of who we are today. I think we're very focused, obviously, on what that
efficiency is.
As I mentioned earlier, the technology infrastructure that we put into place allows for scalability, which is
something that's important to us. So the technology, the drag, and at the cost is for that isn't going to be nearly
what it was before. So definitely not focusing on it, as calling it out isn't something that I want someone to take
away and say, hey, it's not a priority for us. I think it's just day in, day out what we do. And I think as the NIM gets
to an appropriate level back to where we think it should be, you'll see that number get back down to a number that
you'll be happy with.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. All right. Let me ask, so if we look at the expenses which were elevated, you called out related to the
system conversion, how much was that in the fourth quarter, what's expected at 1Q and what comes out in 2Q?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President, Director-Corporate Finance & Business Development & Head-Investor Relations, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. In the operating expense number, there was $5 million associated with the core conversion. In the first
quarter, we anticipate that'll be around $3 million. So it maybe decline $2 million, and then from there on it should
be up.

[indiscernible] (00:53:24) those are really the onetime items or infrequent, whatever you want to refer to them as.
But keep in mind, there is dual operating expenses and running those multiple platforms as well during the
quarter. Once we get to a better place, which we're pretty much right on the verge of, you're going to have those
being eliminated as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President, Director-Corporate Finance & Business Development & Head-Investor Relations, Valley National Bancorp
And I do just want to go back to your efficiency comment, Steve. I mean, if you look back a year ago, our
efficiency ratio was 50% in the fourth quarter of 2022, 60% this year. But relative to average assets, noninterest
expenses declined in that same period. So, I mean, I think it is directly – obviously, it's directly tied to the revenue
environment that you described. But – I mean, we've talked about the head count reductions, so we've seen the
limited head count growth over the five years relative to the asset growth that we put on. So the efficiency ratio
does tend to be more tied to just market dynamics and things both structurally and what we can control, I think
we've done a very good job.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. Okay. Let me ask – you guys called out that the deposit pricing got a bit away from you because of the
system conversion. What's the connection between the two?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
We have a lot of relationship clients which an organization our size should have. I think we have internal models
as to how we look at pricing deposits. I think the focus largely on our frontline staff was on reaching out to clients,
retaining clients, and some of the profitability metrics as to how we think about engaging with our clients, how we
want to direct certain conversations. We're probably distracted based on client retention and based on just
conveying to clients what was going to be new with regards to how they approach the different systems. That
said, I think certain deposit rates from the exception pricing perspective got a little bit out of hand. And there
wasn't necessarily the focus that should have been on making sure that we were within our targeted guidelines as
to what that pricing should be. That said, I'm very confident that we'll get there very, very soon.

...to square that the NIM drivers, you said it's neutral in the short run. But, Ira, you said multiple times, your NIM
should expand – I think you said very nicely – once the curve looks more normal. How long are we talking like
what's the lag? I would think it would be sooner than later. But if we get a positively sloped curve towards the back
end of this year, is that a 2026 story before your NIM start to look more normal? I'm just confused why the Fed
cutting rates, given how much you're paying on deposits, you guys are one of the higher payers, is more
beneficial in the short run. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. I think, right, there's the front end curve, I think, coming down definitely is going to be impactful to us. But
it's the long and where we have a lot more that's tied to. It's definitely going to be a pretty significant tailwind for us
as to how we're thinking about where the net interest income is going to go. I think the commentary was more
along there's some day count issues really that goes into that first quarter, as well as we're not expecting much
change within the first quarter as well. So once the curve does begin to normalize, we do believe that there's
going to be some positive impact to that net interest income and into the margin as well. That said, they're really
not asking – or forecasting anything to really change until the tail end of the first quarter. And there is that
pressure from a day count right off the bat as well.

Good morning, everyone. Just a question on the noninterest income outlook. What are the primary drivers of the
5% to 7% year-over-year growth? And are you expecting a reversion of swap activity closer to the first half of
2023 as opposed to the back half?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
So the biggest driver would be, as I said earlier, stabilization in our noninterest-bearing deposit balances. But that
was the biggest driver of net interest income...

Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
He said noninterest income. I missed that. Sorry about that. So you can see that in our IP deck as well it lays out
the portions of that. Keep in mind that in 2023, we also had some onetime events related to some revenue
recognition that aren't going to repeat in the prior year. But I think when you look at totality of our fee income, we
feel very good about where we're at because it only generates about 10% of our total revenue. Sometimes the
increases in any one category get lost. But I do think given the lower loan growth that we have, swap income will
be somewhat challenged and will be replaced with things like FX, wealth management. And we have a very
strong treasury management project going on in our company. And as we put on more C&I business, we would
expect that to [indiscernible] (00:58:23) income as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nicholas Cucharale Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. And then just looking at the expense base, as you mentioned some investments and some reduction
opportunities throughout 2023, now that the core conversion is complete, what investments are you most focused
on to drive the next leg of growth for the company?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President, Director-Corporate Finance & Business Development & Head-Investor Relations, Valley National Bancorp
I think a lot of them lined up with some of the strategic imperatives that we talked about, right? I mean, I think
when we think about the growth in the C&I and some of the [indiscernible] (00:58:49) businesses that we have,
there's definitely some technology investments that we put forth. That said, a lot of it from a foundation
perspective is already there. It's just enhancements at this point for things that were already put in place, but
really largely aligned with what we've talked about on the strategic side, mostly focused on some of the C&I stuff.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning. Can you talk about how you're thinking about deposit betas and deposit mix as rates come
down? Is there still a lag in how deposit yields come down as rates come down, and do [ph] NIB (00:59:42)
deposits start to rebound once we to a certain level in rates? So, yeah, if you can expand on that and just talk
about how you're thinking about deposit cost through, maybe the first rate cut versus the next few rate cuts.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
Yeah, Manan. This is Travis. So I do think there is some lag on the beta side on the way down. Our model
assumes around 35% beta on the way down. As you can see, the cycle today was 57% on the way up. Relative
to noninterest-bearing, our budget and our forecast assumes that it remains relatively stable as a percentage of
total deposits, around 23%. But I do think there is a terminal point with rates that you do continue to build that
back up. And obviously as we expand C&I and treasury management, I mean, those are strategic initiatives that
are in place to continue to grow noninterest deposits faster than what we actually include in our budget. So that's
some thoughts around that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Very helpful. On the loan growth guide of 5% to 7%, I know that includes some mix shift away from investor CRE.
So can you talk about some of the drivers? And also what is the cadence of that look like? Is that more back-end
loaded and do you need some help from the environment there or is that based on customer conversations you're
having today and there's a high degree of confidence that loan growth will accelerate as we get through this year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President, Director-Corporate Finance & Business Development & Head-Investor Relations, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. It is based on the confidence we have in the conversation with customers and seeing the uptick in their
requests from us and the build on our pipeline that we've experienced in the fourth quarter and so far into
January. And again pointing out to the originations in that fourth quarter, $2.2 billion, up from that $1.8 billion in
the third quarter, and the uptick in our pipelines and C&I's contribution to that pipeline, where it is now the lion's
share. It's 65% of our pipeline; so we are seeing that activity. Typically, the first quarter is a slow quarter as
people get their financial statements in place and you start seeing progressively more business as the quarters
roll on.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And the loan to deposit ratio should stay at about these levels of between 95% to 105%?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
Hey, Matt.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
I had a few questions here with me. First, I was hoping on the NII guide. Could you provide, just for context – I
would love a sense of how dynamic it is – what the guide would be, or estimate what the guide would be under a
no or minimum rate cut scenario for the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President, Director-Corporate Finance & Business Development & Head-Investor Relations, Valley National Bancorp
Sure. It's effectively captured in 3% to 5% range that we provided. If rates stayed flat, then we think that there
would still be upside in NII and margin from our current levels. Again, the most exposure we would have is to
significantly lower rates on the long end. So absent that, the most other interest scenarios would end up in the
kind of guide that we provided.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And I think you also alluded that the NIM has already started to show some stabilization, hopefully
stabilization in the first quarter. Could you provide some detail as to how the NIM provides on a monthly basis
throughout the fourth quarter and if you started to see that stabilization already?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President, Director-Corporate Finance & Business Development & Head-Investor Relations, Valley National Bancorp
We did. November was the low point, I would say, on a monthly basis. When we were on the call last time, we
look back at six consecutive months of generally stable NII and margin. Some of the factors that we've already
talked about in terms of shortening up the liabilities and other things provided a little bit of pressure in the fourth
quarter. But I would say that the margin, again, was at its low point in November. If you look at what we
originated, loan origination yields also bottomed in November and bounced back in December, but new deposit
origination costs actually declined throughout the quarter. So October was the high point and November was
lower, and December even lower than that. One thing I would throw out there too, we do provide obviously in the
deck what our loan origination yields are. And they declined 8 basis points in the quarter, but new deposit
origination costs declined 11 basis points in the quarter, which kind of feeds into the commentary we've provided
on spreads. So November, again, was a low point on the margin. December was somewhat better, if that's
helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. Any frame of reference for what the difference was low to high?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President, Director-Corporate Finance & Business Development & Head-Investor Relations, Valley National Bancorp
It wasn't that significant to be honest. I think November was 4 basis points or 5 basis points lower than December.

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
Got it. Okay. A couple other quick ones. I noticed that service charges on deposit accounts was quite a bit lower
quarter-to-quarter, like 15%. Was that driven by the conversion? And should we expect that [indiscernible]
(01:04:56) to come back to its normal kind of $10.5 million level?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President, Director-Corporate Finance & Business Development & Head-Investor Relations, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. So for about a month around the conversion, we waived certain transactional fees. So if you look at the
decline, it was about $1.5 million, $2 million. That's exactly what that was. So otherwise that would have been flat.
Obviously, we put on a lot of deposits throughout the fourth quarter customer deposits. So that should continue to
drive deposit service charges going forward. That will also be supplemented by the treasury management stuff
that we talked about. That generates deposit revenue as well in the noninterest income area.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then on the average balance sheet, it struck me as odd. Cash balances or interest with bank deposits
was down 90 basis points quarter-to-quarter to 4.6%. I usually look at that as kind of a Fed funds proxy. What
happened there? What drove yields down so substantially in cash categories?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President, Director-Corporate Finance & Business Development & Head-Investor Relations, Valley National Bancorp
I think you're generally right. So we go through an accrual process to estimate what the cash payments received
from the Fed are. The actual payments do tend to move around little bit. So there are certain credits that go in and
out there. So you can have a yield that may not directly align with the interest on overnight reserves.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. But generally speaking, we should model that back to Fed funds?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President, Director-Corporate Finance & Business Development & Head-Investor Relations, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. I think that's generally right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. On page 11 of the presentation, you showed the multifamily portfolio, pretty good detail. What struck me
was that a number of these geographies have weighted average debt service coverage sub 1.4 times. To me, it
feels a little bit risky given the repricing dynamics. So, one, I'm curious, those debt service coverage ratios, are
those at origination or are they updated? And then, two, do you happen to know what the existing loan yield is on
this book versus updated?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. The weighted average debt service coverage are current. They're based on recent rent rolls. We update
that and the loan to values on a regular basis. I don't have the loan yield in front of me, but I will tell you, again,
when we look at that repricing, we've not had to modify any of the terms on our repricing. And our forward look
24

Q4 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jan-2024
where we assess each loan that reprices over the next 12 months, we expect the same results, but we will have
to look that up. I don't know if you have it, Travis?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Travis Lan A
Senior Vice President, Director-Corporate Finance & Business Development & Head-Investor Relations, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. We – so we – I don't have the full portfolio in front of me, but I'll try and give you some color that may be
helpful. So as we show on that page, Matt, we have $420 million of fully rent controlled loans. Those would be the
lowest yielding segment, and that's 4.6% yield. We have another, call it, $1.8 billion, I'd say, of exposure to
properties that have some amount of rent control in them. And that portfolio yields $545 million. So I think when
you look broadly at multifamily, you're going to be closer in total to the $545 million yield, give or take.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And those buckets, the $420 million of pure rent regulated and the $1.8 billion of some rent regulated, those
passed the stress testing you went through as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael D. Hagedorn A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Valley National Bancorp
Yes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
Yeah. And it's the $420 million that's pure rent regulated; and that – it's $1.4 billion, which is partial; 20% are less
rent regulated.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And I know I'm being longwinded, but this is my last one. Ira, you had mentioned some frustration with
overall profitability levels. Can you better define for us at which level you'd be satisfied profitability wise, maybe as
measured by ROA or ROTCE? And as we think the forward model here, when do you think we can get back to,
let's call it, a 1% ROA for the bank?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ira D. Robbins A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Valley National Bancorp
I don't want to go against the guidance that Travis provided, right? But I'm pretty optimistic about where I think
we're going to be in 2024. We were generating 60% of return on tangible common at the end of last year. And I
think that's an appropriate level that we should begin to target and we should get back there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
