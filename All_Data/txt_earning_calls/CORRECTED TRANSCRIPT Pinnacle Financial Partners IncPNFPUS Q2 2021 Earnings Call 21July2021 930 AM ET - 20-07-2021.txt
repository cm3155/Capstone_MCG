M. Terry Turner
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thank you, operator, and thank you for joining us this morning. Q2 was an outstanding quarter in my view. As
most of you know that have been following us for some time, we took a number of actions in early stages of the
pandemic like modifying our extended focus on PPNR growth during 2020 to ensure that we'd be in a position to
quickly return to our pre-pandemic growth trajectory as the pandemic wane.
I think the first two quarters of 2021 would suggest that we've been largely successful in that. We begin every
quarterly call with this dashboard reflecting our key performance metrics on a GAAP basis. But as we most
always do, because there are so many adjustments required in order to focus on variables that we're truly
managing here at Pinnacle, I'll move quickly to the chart reflecting the adjusted non-GAAP measures.
As you can see, the second quarter was another fabulous quarter for us. Linked-quarter annualized loan growth
ex-PPP was 12.6%. Linked-quarter annualized core deposit growth was 14.2%. Linked-quarter annualized
revenue growth was 20.1%, and already strong asset quality got even better. On a lot of these earnings calls, I try
to provide more color on all or several of the key metrics that are on this chart. But today, I want to focus more on
the big picture and that's really the speed and the reliability of the growth over an extended period of time.
Look at the CAGRs for virtually every important growth metric, I think that demonstrates the speed and reliability
of our growth even in the phase of the various headwinds we've encountered over time. Take EPS as an
example. 17% CAGR. You got a dip in 1Q and 2Q 2020 associated with the COVID-triggered reserve bill. But
other than that, the growth is extremely reliable. Look at the revenue CAGR, loan CAGR, the deposit CAGR, all
are very fast, all are very reliable.
Most of you know we conducted a three-day orientation program for every single new associate to this firm
conducted by me and other key leaders here. We invest time to help associates understand its culture, why it is,
what it is, and what – where it makes a difference. It's intended to inspire a high-level of associate excitement and
engagement.
One of the topics that we cover in great detail is how we produce shareholder value, the hour-long sessions
conducted by Harold, and is intended to help every single associate personalize specifically what they do
individually that increase the shareholder value and the kinds of the things they might do that destroy shareholder
value.
But the principal takeaway we expect every single associate to get is that two things are required for us to
produce outside shareholder returns, number one, speed of growth and number two, reliability to grow. So, how is

it that we produce such fast and reliable growth, and how is it that we expect to continue rapid reliable growth
going forward, excuse me, even as many of our peers are being overwhelmed by the current headwinds like flat
loan demand and heavy payout.
First of all, we've positioned ourselves in fabulous markets with extraordinary sales and growth dynamics. Most of
you heard me talk about our outlook in markets like Nashville, Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina, Greenville
and Charleston, South Carolina, and Atlanta, one of the biggest and best markets in the country. And of course,
those [indiscernible] (00:06:05) and growth dynamics are critical to growth. It's just hard to have a large, high
growth buying for that large high growth market.
On last quarter's call, I talked about the fact that I expected to continue hiring revenue producers in our existing
footprint at a rapid pace. And if we likely have opportunities to expand in other Southeastern markets due to the
high level of M&A activity, and all of the associated vulnerabilities that that creates. And so, you see here primarily
as a result of integration turmoil, we were the most desirable alternative for a good number of high-profile revenue
producers in Birmingham, the Southeast 13th largest market, and Huntsville, the Southeast 13th fastest growing
market in terms of GDP. I want you to [indiscernible] (00:06:47) our reputation as a highly successful challenger
brand to those large regional national franchises caused those frustrated teams to seek us out.
And I'm not trying to foreshadow anything in particular here, but I'd be shocked that we don't have more of those
hiring opportunities going forward. As M&A appears to be picking up in the bureaucratic ground as many of our
larger competitors continues to weigh on their associates. So, the markets we currently serve and the markets
that are likely available to us over time would suggest an ability to grow rapidly on an organic basis, even at a
time when many are going to struggle to grow revenue and earnings organically.
Now, in my judgment, more important even than the size and growth dynamics of our markets, is the fact that this
firm has been built to create raving fans. I'm confident virtually every bank you listen to, will talk about service. I
know not one arm has ever said we're trying to give poor service and bad advice. But trust me, many do. So, let
me spend a minute on just how differentiated our service and advisors from every other bank in our footprint.
What you're looking at here is data from Greenwich Associates, the foremost provider of commercial market
research to large banks in the United States. This stat is based on client responses across our entire footprint.
That means businesses with annual sales from $1 million to $500 million in Tennessee, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Atlanta, and Roanoke. So, let's focus on the Pinnacle line at the bottom of the chart. You see the navy
blue portion of the bar that 80% of the Pinnacle client survey rated as a 9 or a 10 on the question, how likely are
you to recommend your lead provider to a friend or colleague using a scale of 0 to 10, where zero means not at
all likely, and 10 means extremely likely. So, in other words 80% of our clients are highly engaged active
promoters. Trust me. That's an extremely unusual level of engagement. Another 19% rated us a 7 or 8. That's not
bad, combining the two, 99% of our clients rated us a 7 or better on a 10-point scale. But that 19%, that gold
portion of the bar scored us a 7 or 8. They're referred to as passive because while they're generally rating well,
they're not so fired up as to be vocal advocates for you in the market.
And then that last 1%, the red portion of the bar, are detractors, meaning they rated you somewhere between 0
and 6, out beside that blue bar, out beside our bar there, you can see a 79. That's the Net Promoter Score, the
number of promoters less the number of detractors. And you see that score is wildly differentiated from all our
major competitors in our footprint. And not only is that a fabulous Net Promoter Score in the Southeast. According
to Greenwich, it's the second best Net Promoter Score in the country.

Now, if you bear with me just another minute here on this slide, is not just that our Net Promoter Score is higher.
It's also that banks with the most clients to lose have very low Net Promoter Scores with lots of detractors. When
you look at the gold boxes at the top of slide, you see the top five banks in terms of market share have an
average Net Promoter Score of 40.2%, and the top 10 banks in terms of market share have an average Net
Promoter Score of 51%.
One of the top five banks in our footprint from a market share perspective has a Net Promoter Score of 6, and
36% of their clients are actively detracting from their reputation. So, the banks that have the most share are
extraordinarily vulnerable. The [ph] difference (00:10:22) between their clients' perception of their service versus
ours where we have a Net Promoter Score of 79 is [ph] really wide (00:10:29) or differentiated, as I say.
I've already talked about the size and growth dynamics of our market and how they bear on growth. But more
importantly, in our very attractive footprint, the banks who currently have the [ph] share lead (00:10:41) are
extraordinarily vulnerable. So, if you think about the speed and reliability of growth which is largely dependent on
taking share as opposed to economic loan demand, this explains why we've been so successful taking share over
the last 20 years while we bring loans ex-PPP 12.6% on an annualized basis this quarter, and why I believe we'll
continue to produce outsized growth for the foreseeable future.
I know for some, Net Promoter Score is seen much more abstract than ROTCES and efficiency ratios. So, let me
take two minutes, see if I can make it a little more tangible for you. Many of you might be familiar with an app
called Nextdoor, an app that allows neighbors to seek and give tips to each other. Here, in the gray box at the top
left of the slide, someone's looking for a new bank. The blue dialog boxes on the right are a sampling of the tips
provided by neighbors.
You can see Pinnacle clients raving about Pinnacle, obviously, clients who have been wowed by our service.
These are promoters. At last check, there were 125 comments or recommendations on this request. Pinnacle
received 34, the next most frequently mentioned tip received eight. Now, multiply that across our entire footprint
and that's what promoters do for you.
We've achieved that kind of differentiated client engagement because this wowing of clients permeates everything
we do in this firm. Let me take a second to illustrate how it works. Over the last year or so, we've had ample
opportunity to talk about our approach to the pandemic, it began with an offensive outreach to our clients in the
very early stages of pandemic to see if they needed a deferral. Some clients focused on short-term asset quality
metrics and we're slow to defer payments. We focused on helping our clients about whom we're passionate, and
as an aside, our asset quality performed extremely well. But more importantly, clients rave.
This chart shows our relative outperformance versus the large banks with whom we compete. Here, we're just
comparing each bank percentage of national loans outstanding versus the percentage of national PPP loans
originated through this bank. Most banks were less successful on PPP than the size of their loan book would have
suggested. As you can see, all the large banks with whom we compete underperformed, but we outperformed.
And I believe it's because it was a matter of urgency for us to take care of our clients who were struggling. It was
a cause célèbre in this firm to get our clients taken care of.
I don't take the time today to develop it fully, but Greenwich developed a Crisis Response Index to measure how
well clients perceived their banks' response during the pandemic. And in the fourth quarter of 2020, Pinnacle had
the highest Crisis Response Index of Greenwich's entire coverage universe.

In the most recent round of PPP, there's been a great deal written about how many applications didn't get
processed, how many applicants got left at the station. There was recently a syndicated article in many of the
nation's business journals like the Nashville Business Journal as an example, where our competitors talk about
their dissolution with the SBA for cutting the program off, leaving them with so many unprocessed applications.
Those comments are listed on the right-hand side of this slide.
My view is that many of them just played ignorant and were offering excuses as to why they didn't get their clients
taken care of. In the last round of PPP, we took 9,790 applications. Guess how many didn't get submitted to the
SBA, just 71. This entire firm worked feverishly, reallocated available resources, knowing that we were competing
for a limited pool of funding, and we got them all done but 71. So, we got 99.3% of our clients taken care of. So,
on the right side, you can see what our clients said about us. Those are promoters.
As far as I know, there's no chance of creating that kind of client experience without creating a highly engaging
associate experience. We measure our associate experience primarily via work environment survey of all
associates. We hold each leader accountable for receiving 70% top box ratings from their associates. In other
words, for each statement that associates are asked to write their level of agreement, leaders should have
created an environment where their associates rate them strongly agree 70% of the time. I'm not aware of any
firms that set that kind of target or achieve that kind of result. But even in a disastrous year like 2020, handling
difficult process and procedural changes, quarantines, reduced cash incentives and so forth, we still hit the 70%
top box target. That's an engaged workforce.
One of the reasons that we've created such a high level of trust with our associates is that we operate with a win
together, lose together philosophy. If we earned our incentives, we all get paid. If we earned diminished
incentives, we all earn diminished incentives. If we fail to earn our incentives, we all fail to earn our incentives. We
win together and we lose together. Not only has that been a powerful team builder throughout our 20-year history,
but it puts us in great stead at a time like this when there's increased emphasis on equity.
In 2020, 99% of our employees of color feel that management shows a sincere interest in them as a person
versus an industry benchmark of 80%. 96% of female employees feel they receive a fair share of profits versus a
benchmark of 75%. 91% of female employees feel that managers avoid playing favorites. 93% of female
employees feel that promotions go to those who deserve them best. 90% of employees of color feel that they're
paid fairly for the work that they do, and that's versus a benchmark of 72%.
And so this alignment that we've created results in extraordinary retention of all our associates, which means two
things that bear on growth. Number one, since associate turnover is the number one deterrent to give a great
service, associate engagement continues to create promoters, which leads to more organic growth. And number
two, since associate turnover leads to client turnover generally, this level of associate retention minimizes client
attrition which, of course, bears on their growth.
So, what I'm trying to do is bring into focus for you this quarter the speed and the reliability of our growth over time
as well as the structural reasons we'd expect outsized growth to continue for the foreseeable future.
So, Harold, let me turn it over to you for more detailed review of the quarter.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
Thanks, Terry. Good morning, everybody. We're obviously pleased with our second quarter loan growth results.
Excluding PPP, average loans were up 9% between the first and second quarters. Excluding PPP, end of period
loans at June 30 compared to March 31 were up 12.6% annualized.
As to loan yields, the yield curve remained volatile during the second quarter, and we have mentioned for at least
the last two conference calls, loan yields will be a fight in 2021. We will lean into our relationships even harder to
maintain our yields.
Overall loan rates were basically flat with the first quarter but that was assisted by a big quarter and likely a high-
water mark for PPP forgiveness. PPP forgiveness boosted the second quarter yield on PPP loans to 5.47% from
4.51% in the first quarter. It will continue to be difficult to model loan yields for the next few quarters given the
impact of PPP. Excluding PPP loans, our average loan yield approximated 3.98% compared to approximately
4.07% in the first quarter.
So, where to from here? Our market leaders continue to believe that a loan growth forecast excluding PPP in the
high-single digits for 2021 to be a reasonable growth target for our firm. As always, we will lean on our new
recruits to give us an advantage on loan growth, coupled with our markets which we believe to be some of the
best banking markets, with many of the best bankers in the Southeast, we're optimistic about our loan growth
goals this year.
We also recently announced our expansion into Huntsville and Birmingham with seven relationship managers in
total. We and they are both very excited about our opportunities in these two markets. And as to loan volumes, we
are modeling around $150 million in loan growth this year from those two markets and expecting P&L breakeven
from our new associates in late 2022.
As to yields, we have some reason to be optimistic that our core yields are stabilizing, so additional dilution of our
loan yields excluding PPP will likely occur but should slow. Obviously, the yield curve does impact all of this so,
hopefully, we get some stabilizations to help curtail the decrease in loan yields. As to PPP yields, it's anybody's
guess. And even though we will continue to work our borrowers proactively, we don't believe we will see quite the
pace of forgiveness in 3Q than we experienced in 2Q.
That said, since the start of PPP, we recorded $125 million in fees associated with the program, of which we've
recognized 60% of those fees thus far. So we still have $48 million in unrecognized fees, which we believe will
help bolster long yields at least over the near term.
Now on to deposits, we had another big deposit quarter, but not quite as large as several of our previous quarters.
Core deposits were up almost $900 million in the second quarter. We've experienced significant growth in
noninterest-bearing deposits, ending up at $8.9 billion at quarter-end, up 29.5% since the end of last year.
Our average loans to average deposit ratio was up slightly in the second quarter to 82.7%. So we consider that a
small victory as this is the first increase in our loan-to-deposit ratio since the first quarter of last year. Our average
deposit rates were 20 basis points, while EOP deposit rates were at 18 basis points. So, we continue to see
downward momentum for 2021 and look to be around 10 basis points to 15 basis points by the fourth quarter of
2021, assuming our short-term rate forecast plays out for the remainder of this year. Helping us get there will be
about $1 billion or so in maturing CDs over the next two quarters that have an average rate of approximately 70
basis points current.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
Liquidity continues to gain attention from all banks. The yield curve remains on everyone's mind. We did put some
excess liquidity to work this quarter, approximately $650 million in additional investment securities. We don't
currently anticipate any more big security purchases this year.
As to the interest rate risk management, we do have a balance sheet bias today of rates being neutral to up
slightly over the next year or two. So before all the bond experts beat me up for deploying money in the fixed rate
bonds in the second quarter, we did execute an interest rate swap on the front-end cash flow of about 50% of
those bonds we acquired swapping the cash flows from fixed to variable, so our interest – so our asset-sensitivity
position is essentially the same before and after the bond transaction, but we did pick up, say, a 100 basis points
in yields over what we're receiving on the cash purchases.
Our securities to assets ratio increased to 15% in 2Q, and we expect that to hold for the foreseeable future. Our
estimate is that peers, say, banks 20 billion to $60 billion of assets are running a good bit more than that, say, in
the 25% range. We continue to look at ways to create increased momentum through deployment of excess
liquidity in the higher-yielding assets or elimination of wholesale funding sources. All those lines, and in addition to
the bond purchases we made in the second quarter, we increased our repo instrument we acquired in the first
quarter from $450 million to $500 million in the second quarter. As I mentioned last time, this repo instrument is
secured by the counterparty's investment securities portfolio and yields around 40 basis points.
We are looking at another somewhat similar repo product, but it will likely be somewhat less [ph] in balances
(00:22:46) than the repo we have on our balance sheet currently. We also reduced our wholesale funding book in
the second quarter by almost $1 billion. Many of you might recall that we bolstered our liquidity at the start of
pandemic with additional brokers and other funds by more than $2.4 billion. At this time, a significant amount of
that has been redeemed. We have about $250 million left to redeem this year and $400 million in 2022 and 2023.
Additionally, we have about $900 million in Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings that cost us an annual rate of
2%. We continue to explore prepaying those FHLB borrowings, but the prepayment penalty remains too rich for
us right now.
Lastly, we do fully anticipate redeeming $130 million in bank-level sub-debt in a few weeks using available cash.
The sub-debt instruments call date was during the pandemic last year, but we elected to hold on to the capital at
that time and now feel the current environment provides us enough confidence to eliminate this funding, which is
causing us about 3.3% annually and [indiscernible] (00:23:45) going to lose some of its favorable capital
treatment.
In the supplemental information, we've updated our interest rate sensitivity which with all the initiatives we
accomplished in the second quarter points toward increased asset sensitivity in the up 100 scenario. As it stands
currently, we like where our balance sheet is positioned with no big moves planned on our current agenda. As the
chart at the top left of the slide illustrates, our net interest margin after PPP and liquidity was approximately 3.25%
in the second quarter, which compares to a similar calculation last quarter at 3.29%. Thus, our adjusted NIM after
being up for four quarters in a row retreated slightly but has held steady over the last year or so.
As to the credit, obviously, Tim is not here, but rest easy, he's on the job doing what he does best, working both
our relationship managers and clients, and making sure we continue our focus on being a well-run and very
sound financial institution. Using the big – the four big traditional credit metrics of net charge-offs, classified
assets, NPAs and past due accruing loans, Pinnacle's loan portfolio continues to perform very well. And in many
cases, these are the best credit metrics we've experienced in quite some time.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
In the second quarter, as was the case in prior quarters, during COVID, our bankers and credit teams continued
their diligence around conducting thorough credit reviews with particular emphasis placed on non-past credits, our
hotel portfolio and credits in the COVID-specific low-pass risk grade categories. Our second quarter credit metrics
remained very encouraging. As noted on the slide, net charge-offs are running at a respectable 17 basis points.
Our classified asset ratio declined to a very strong 6.8%. NPAs also decreased this quarter, down to 27 basis
points, and past dues were down to just 7 basis points, which collectively points to the great effort our relationship
managers and credit officers across our firm, keeping a strong focus on settlements.
Many of us appreciate that in order to obtain these sort of credit trends, it takes discipline and active
management. During the second quarter, our relationship managers and credit officers not only experienced an
uptick in credit requests and loan growth, they also worked to see all four of the major credit metrics improve as
well. Great work, everybody.
Our credit team continues to bounce back and forth between offense and defense as they work diligently to assist
our relationship managers in structuring new loans appropriately as well as maintain an alertness toward the
existing portfolio and looking for any trends point towards incremental deterioration. Tactically, during the second
quarter, the credit team essentially accomplished the detailed credit reviews aimed at hotels and non-pass
exposures.
For the second half of the year, our attention will remain on the COVID segments particularly hotels. Again, it's a
good report on hotel occupancy, revenue per room, average daily rate, all trending in the right direction. As to
occupancy, we continue to grow at about 5% higher than national rates with our hotel portfolio seeing 65%
occupancy through the first two months of the same quarter. We expect June occupancy to be even higher as the
national occupancy rates trended up in June as well.
If you recall, we downgraded all our hotels to criticized last spring at the onset of the pandemic. It's now time to
review what has transpired and begin to look to establish upgrade targets over the next few quarters. Our credit
officers have initiated a hotel upgrade plan for our criticized hotel loans. As such, the credit officers will be looking
to support operating trends over the last 12 months and the ability to meet minimum PPNR debt service coverage
ratios. Hopefully, we will have another good report for you on hotels at our next call in October.
As noted on the slide, we expect continued reductions in our allowance to total loan ratio over the next several
quarters as the overall economic outlook continues to improve and our COVID impacted loan segments continue
to trend positive. All in all, Pinnacle' credit metrics have held up really well. And even though we have shifted back
to a more offensive stance, we will continue our thorough defensive work particularly in the COVID impacted
segments.
Now to fee income, well, lots of good news here. For the quarter, fee revenues were up more than 34% over the
same quarter number of last year. Wealth management, which is investment services, trust and insurance had a
great quarter in comparison to last year, up more than 35%. We continue to be very active on the hiring front
across our franchise, particularly as we continue to build wealth management in the Carolinas and Atlanta, and
eventually, Birmingham and Huntsville.
You might think that we were disappointed in our mortgage results for the second quarter, quite the contrary,
mortgage has had a phenomenal last four or so quarters at $6.7 million for the second quarter. We are pleased
and believe we have an excellent chance on holding that run rate for the rest of the year, assuming the rate
environment holds.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
SBA loan sales had a great quarter and we're optimistic that this business should hold for the remaining two
quarters of this year. We also had a great quarter with respect to our equity investments. Excluding BHG, one of
our investments completed a follow-on equity raise during the quarter, the results of which provided us significant
insight into an updated valuation of that investment. And thus we booked a $2 million increase for this one
investment. I'll talk more about BHG in just a second.
As to expenses, specifically incentives, I think everyone is familiar with the impact of incentive costs to our
expense base. And if our earnings hit our targets, costs go up, if not, costs go down. Last year, we did not hit our
targets thus and sales were significantly below expectations with our eventual payout equating to 65% of our
targets. We can't fully anticipate based on the current operating environment that 2021 will come back strong, and
hopefully our associates will recoup some of the lost incentive from 2020.
Along those lines, we've provided an opportunity in 2021 for our associates to earn an outsized incentive as much
as 160% of target. However, and as we've said repeatedly, there's no free lunch. Increased incentives only occur
if our earnings growth supports the incentive. Additionally, we anticipate max payout retreating back to the
traditional 125% of target in 2022.
All in, incentive costs are higher than anticipated this quarter as we gain accruing at the maximum award for
2021. Thus, we experienced a catch-up from the first quarter. We believe the incentive costs for third and fourth
quarter will be slightly less than the second quarter. As to our overall total expense run rate, we now believe that
expenses for the third and fourth quarter should be flat to down from the amounts we booked in the second
quarter.
Quickly, some comments on capital. I mentioned the sub debt. We mentioned earlier we also intend to redeem
another $120 million in sub debt issuance later this year, so we'll work with our regulators on that matter after the
next – over the next few months. And as I mentioned last time and I want to just reinforce the point, we've
intensified our focus on tangible book value growth by adding a peer-relative component to our leadership's equity
compensation plan.
We're currently calculating an annualized increase of 13.5% in our tangible book value per share thus far this
year. Our plan is designed that we will compare our tangible book value per share growth with that of our peers
along with relative return on tangible common equity and relative total shareholder return in determining the
vesting results for our core leadership.
As to our outlook for the rest of 2021, I won't go into the slide in-depth as we've covered much of this previously.
So this again is really a summary of – for the model builders of what we currently believe. Obviously, we realize
that we appear more optimistic than most. That said we have great confidence in our people, our markets and our
clients and renewed optimism about where Pinnacle is headed.
Now BHG. This is a slide that we've shown for several quarters. The blue bars on the chart are originations with
record demand set for the past four quarters. In fact, they've almost doubled loan originations over that time
period. BHG would also tell you that their market share is less than 1%. So we believe much room for growth. As
their research would indicate that the personal, small and mid-sized business lending, home improvement and
patient finance businesses are collectively at $925 billion annual loan origination business and BHG intends to be
competitive. The green bar represents loans on which gain on sale has been recorded as these loans are sold to
downstream banks. This is the traditional BHG model which generates revenues associated with their gain on
sale model.

As to the bottom left chart, borrower coupons have fluctuated only slightly over the last few years, ending at
13.4% for the second quarter. Bank buy rates fell to new records at just under 4% in the second quarter. So net
spreads remained in the mid and highs which over time is up from previous years. As noted on the text on the
slide, BHG executed on their securitization in the second quarter. Last year, the first securitization was
approximately $177 million. This year securitization approximately $375 million. They also are looking to conduct
another similar style securitization before the end of 2021. Doing this allows them to take advantage of somewhat
very attractive funding rates as well as diversify both the revenue stream and funding sources. We consider the
diversification strategy a good idea even though the gain on sale model results in more near term earnings for
BHG.
I've noted that BHG is rapidly approaching a 50/50 revenue split between the gain on sale in all balance sheet
models and believe in 2023 they could in fact be there, much sooner than we anticipated. The bottom right chart
now shows over 1,200 banks in BHG's network and almost 700 individual banks acquired BHG loans over the last
12 months. Again, one of the strongest funding platforms for a gain on sale model in the United States.
As to credit, we've updated BHG's recourse obligation chart. On the chart on the left, the green bars detail loans
that BHG has sold in the network of community and other banks which currently amounts to just over $4 billion in
credit sold through their network. The blue line on the chart details the recourse accrual and the percentage of
outstanding loans with these other banks. As noted, the recourse obligation is a reserve for future loss absorption.
As noted on the chart, during 2020, BHG increased their reserves in anticipation of potential losses from the
pandemic with the reserves standing at 7.65% of outstanding loans at year-end 2020. During the second quarter
of 2021 and as a result of a better outlook, BHG decreased the pandemic-related reserves in the second quarter.
As a percentage of loan it was down approximately 100 basis point.
As noted on the chart at the bottom right, the trailing 12-month losses landed at 4.5%, basically consistent with
the last few years and [indiscernible] (00:35:16) where who knew how COVID would impact loss rates. This chart
has also been updated from our previous presentations to better split the actual credit loss from losses BHG
absorbs from reimbursing banks for the unamortized premium the acquiring bank pay to get the loan. As the chart
indicates, the prepayment portion has gotten somewhat larger over the last few years. Keep in mind, prepayment
losses are for good loans that are just paid off prior to maturity. This could be attributable to several reasons but
primarily the actual premium paid for BHG credit has gotten somewhat larger. Consumer credit which is
occupying more of BHG's business tends to have a higher prepayment track record, and loans are being paid off
earlier as rates have decreased.
We've again updated these two charts. The quality of BHG's borrowers has improved steadily in the past and over
the last few years. BHG continues to refine their scorecards and increased the quality of its borrowing base.
Again, the right chart, and as I've said before, maybe even the most powerful chart I have to offer related to
BHG's steadily improving credit quality. Looking at losses by vintage, losses continue to level out in earlier months
from origination, thus point toward a lower loss percentage over the life of the underlying loan. The quality of the
borrowing base in our opinion is very impressive and much better than just from a few years ago.
Lastly, we see yet another great – had another great operating quarter in the second quarter and exceeded
everyone expectations yet again. We've upped our expectations for 2021. Now expect in 2021 to produce
outsized growth in relation to 2020 of approximately 40% compared to our prior estimate of 20% to 25% or more.
We are also adding a growth factor for 2020 of approximately 30%, thus no rest for the BHG as they continue to
build a strong and more revenue diverse franchise. As the slide indicates, they've got more ideas. They're in
some phase of development which should foster continued growth over the next several years. All in, we believe

Steven Alexopoulos Q

Good morning, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Good morning, Steve.

Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Hey, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I wanted to start, so the pace of hiring seems to have picked up pretty nice, right, 36 revenue producers added in
the quarter. Is this a function of you guys having more of an appetite to increase hiring here or are you just seeing
more opportunities from other banks?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think that's a great question. The short answer is we are seeing more opportunities from other banks. I
think you probably heard us talk about this. Our approach to hire revenue producers, that's sort of the top of the
waterfall for us and we've – I would have said all along we've got an unlimited appetite. We have experienced
people that we're confident can move large boats of business. We'll hire as many of those as we come across as
many of those as we have opportunities to hire.
But the case is that we are finding greater opportunities to hire people and, as I said there in the comments,
Steve, I think a lot of that is tied to M&A activity and just the frustrations that go along with being acquired. It may
be, in the case of some MOEs, just in your market you have to be on the wrong end of the stick there, if you will.
And so that's creating a lot of opportunity. And then I think a couple of big banks were just in a difficult spot
whether it's with regulators or whatever, but the bureaucratic ground is really working on their people, and so
there's a lot of vulnerability that comes out of that.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. That's good color. Yeah, I'm curious if we look at the 216 revenue producers that you
onboarded over the past two and a half years, given that we've basically been in a pandemic for about half the
time they've been at your bank, as the economy now more fully reopens, right, people are getting back to in-
person meetings, are you starting to see an acceleration in terms of that group being able to move the
relationships over to Pinnacle?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I can't give you a definite answer on that statement and I have – I don't have the data just yet to say that for sure,
but that is my intuition. I think a lot of the growth is coming from new hires moving their books to – that's a large
part of what the growth is. And I do think it's a true statement that during the pandemic people were – they were
able to move business, but definitely had a longer sales cycle and it took them longer to get it done. And so that
growth was somewhat retarded during the pandemic and so our expectation is that it should pick up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And thanks. And just finally on BHG with quarterly originations, as Harold pointed out, running at 2 times
the pre-pandemic level, what would explain that and is it sustainable? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, Steve. I've had quite a few conversations with BHG about that. They believe it's very sustainable. They
attribute the growth rate to better analytics. They've hired more people in their analyst group. They think they're
going after a market with much more pinpoint precision and believe that there's plenty of business out there for
them to go try to target. So, relaying what they've told us and then looking at what they're ascertaining for the rest
of this year and next year, we're pretty excited about what they've got in front of them.

Hi, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
So, I wanted to dig down into loan growth a little bit. Looked like the C&I growth was particularly strong, which has
always been one of your strong suits, but I'm wondering if there's been any changes as the bank has grown. Have
you had to look at larger loan sizes or is the balance sheet becoming any less granular over time? And then, also
the growth in consumer real estate, looked like a lot of that from Nashville. So if you could just dig down into what
you're seeing on the loan growth side a little bit more?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think there were one or two larger credits, call it, $30 million, $40 million in the first quarter that came – I
mean, in the second quarter, that were booked that helped bolster loan volumes, but I wouldn't think that that's
any different than, call it, over the last several quarters. There's always been some larger credits mixed up in
there.
As to consumer real estate, we are seeing some increased traffic with respect to that product. We're seeing, with
where the market is right now and Nashville particularly I think is unique in some respects with a lot of smaller
businesses and also with, call it, sons and daughters of clients that are looking to get into the house – get their
first home acquired or otherwise buying a house that they may not want to go through the traditional mortgage
market with. And so we accommodate them as do, I think, a lot of other banks with particular products designed
to meet that need. And so I think that's what's causing some of the increase particularly in Nashville.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Steve, I might add to that. I do think it's important we've not increased our house limits in years. And so again
there's not a intentional – intent to drive credit sizes larger and we're always cautious about that game because
obviously – particularly if you talk about upper middle market credits, the higher the credit size, generally the
lower the rate and so forth. So, anyway, I would just say we've not increased our house limits or done anything
that would cause us to focus on higher tickets in particular.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Great.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
And I might add to that, Steve, for whatever it's worth, I think in our North and South Carolina footprint and let's
call it the old BNC footprint, their growth was very strong. I think Rick Callicutt might tell you that it was his best
loan growth quarter in the history of him running that organization there. And you can see that it is more skewed
towards C&I which was what our thesis is don't screw up their CRE business but [indiscernible] (00:45:09) C&I
business and so we're getting increased activity in the C&I sector there.

Got it. Okay. And then it looked like commercial construction picked up a good bit in the quarter as well. And I'm
just kind of wondering what you guys are seeing in terms of new projects coming online, if you've seen a material
pickup there, kind of your customer sentiment and new investments in some of these projects?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I don't know if there's any significant new projects. We are seeing some come across, but I think a lot of the
construction funding that was in the second quarter were projects that had worked through their equity phase and
now they're- into where they're using bank money to fund the additional construction requirements. So, I'm not –
maybe Terry has got some updated information on that, but I don't – we don't see – there's obviously some in-
coming traffic with respect to multi-family and warehouse. We're not seeing a whole lot of additional requests for
call it hospitality or spec office.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. And then maybe last one for me just kind of thinking about the fees for a minute. I think you guys
said you would expect mortgage to kind of be similar to this quarter in the back half of the year. But if I'm looking
at your slide, I guess it's slide 60, it looks like production and even gain on sale margins are still fairly well
elevated to 2019 levels. So I'm just kind of wondering why that revenue would kind of decline more to a – or
sustain at a more 2019 sort of level if that's the case?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, we think there's a lot of things going on in mortgage right now. They've had a great last year or so. They've
produced a lot of revenues for us. But the housing markets I think in our most vibrant markets call it Nashville,
Raleigh, Charlotte, Atlanta, the inventory is really getting depleted and then they're finding a lot of cash buyers.
And so the mortgage tickets are either non-existent or reducing. And so we're trying to kind of anticipate that a
little bit here going into the last part of the year, which typically would be slower.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I see the – I think the other aspect of that is compared to 2019 we're in markets that weren't in like Atlanta,
Birmingham and Huntsville. And if you looked at the number of mortgage originators, there's an incremental head
count versus 2019. So we've added origination capability.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That's a great point. Okay. Well that's great. And then, sorry, maybe one last tack-on just the
SBA run rate did look like it jumped pretty significantly in the quarter. Is that sustainable or is that more kind of a
one-time increase on some built up production on balance sheet that you sold off?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, that runs through Rick Callicutt and had a couple conversations with Rick about that. He believes it's
sustainable. He believes well there'll be a big kind of a congressional proposal here over the next month or so.
Right now we can sell up to 90% of the loan from [ph] 75% (00:48:41) and we believe in the next month or so

we're hopeful Congress will renew that and extend it. So, we're hopeful for that and – because that would play
into that assertion about maintaining that same volume here over the next couple quarters.

more hires in what are currently non-Pinnacle markets in the coming months and quarters as you guys – as you
indicated before, I guess, you're seeing more proactive in-coming calls, people interested in working for you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think the answer to that is yes, Jennifer. [indiscernible] (00:49:57) in the comments or not, I don't want to
necessarily foreshadow that we will go to additional markets. But on the other hand, I'd be shocked if we don't
have other opportunities going forward. I think your take on our sentiment is that it's right that there's increased
vulnerability, and we are having more people reach out to us and so forth. So, I expect – I don't have a market
that we're ready to announce. But I'd be surprised over the next 12 months if we didn't have one or two.

I don't think so. Jennifer, I may not – I don't want to rule Texas out because it's a fabulous market. There might be

classify, is in the Southeast. And so, again, I think it's markets East of us and South of us and [indiscernible]

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And when you're hiring, how much wage pressure are you seeing right now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I would say we are seeing a little wage pressure. But at this point I don't see it as overwhelming in the hiring part
of the equation. But I think you're on the right track in that we have to work hard. There's sort of two aspects to it,
one is offense and one is defense. So, we're constantly on offense trying to hire new people. We're also
constantly on defense trying to protect our associates. And so we do see some pressure as people come after
and target our associates, we don't let them – we're not likely to let get associates get away. And so you do see
some price pressure there.

those markets individually with the same strategy you did in Atlanta or is that a – is that an area where you really
need to start thinking about potentially doing some type of a deal to get into those markets and hit more of them at
one time?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Let me see if I can be clear on that. One is we like the top 25 markets in the Southeast, period, which as
you say, a good number of them are included in Florida. And so, those are attractive markets to us.
I think the second thing I would say is I tried to be clear, although evidently was not clear, in our last call that I
think M&A is on the table. What I've tried to say to people is the only reason I say it's on the table is because I've
said before it was not on the table. And so, I'm really just trying to say, hey, look, I've said we wouldn't do it. I'm
saying we might do it.
But all that said, that is not the most likely path for us, the most likely path, I love de novo starts, and I think the
opportunity for de novo starts are perhaps better now than I ever remember them. And so, to Jennifer's question,
we are having people that are reaching out to us. And the more people that reach out to us and if we hire, the
more that creates a dialog that opens opportunities for other markets and those kinds of things.
So, I guess, Jared, in trying to be as direct as I could be, I don't want to rule M&A out, but I wouldn't view it to be
the most likely. The most likely is we would extend on a de novo basis. And I do believe we're likely to have some
opportunities over the next few years in kind of most of those top 25 markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
That's great color. Thanks. And then shifting over BHG. As BHG sort of expands their mandate and grows
beyond, first, the medical professionals and the licensed professionals into these newer areas, are the bank
buyers – do the bank buyers have the same appetite for that new form of customer? Or do you expect that that
paper is going to be what really fuels future securitizations?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Well, I think they'll pay for left-right, left-right through securitization and gain-on-sale. Carefully, I will speak
into the individual that runs their outplacement group, the person that positions loans with other banks. And he
told me – I guess, this was four, five months ago, that he could put 3x through that pipeline.
So, there's plenty of appetite that's available to BHG to run loans through that gain-on-sale model. But that said, I
think they still believe that revenue diversification and funding source diversification is where they want to go. I
think a 50/50 split maybe where they think they'll end up and start maybe with less frequency going to the balance
sheet model just to kind of – just because I think at that time they'll be pushing more loans through gain-on-sale.
So, the great point in all this is that they have the option. They can always reduce their appetite for the balance
sheet model and run more loans through gain-on-sale and thus generate more near-term profit if they so desire.
But as it sits right now, they're trying to get to that 50/50 split.

Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just finally for me, Harold, you talked about the maturing CDs coming due over the
next two quarters. Should we expect that you just sort of let those run off and CD balances decline and potentially
cash balances go down or will most likely be renewed into a lower [ph] amount (00:56:57)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, I think there's $300 million or $400 million of that that's in the wholesale group, so those will get redeemed.
But the rest are clients CDs and we fully intend to renew those. And so, they'll probably get renewed down into
the – call it, the 25 basis point category, somewhere along in that line.

Hey, Brett.

Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Wanted just to talk about the guidance for a second on NII. And I realize that the PPP income is likely to impact
the margin negatively in the back half of the year. And it's hard to predict what that income will be. But it would
seem like your guidance around NII approximating the first half of the year could be conservative just kind of
given the growth or it essentially implies that the margin pressure could be like 10 basis points or maybe a little
more. Harold, can you maybe just walk through how you're giving that guidance and the components of it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Sure. We – first of all, you're right on your point about PPP. We don't anticipate nearly the revenue traffic or
revenue flow that we got in the second quarter in the third and fourth quarters. The round two loans are the ones
that will have most of the forgiveness opportunities here over the next, call it, three or four quarters. They have an
extended tail. They're five-year credits, it's all that kind of stuff. But we will work with those borrowers and try to
accelerate [ph] and give as (00:58:39) best as we can.
With that said, I'm – I've got currently an 18 basis point kind of deposit rate right now on my deposit book. I think
it's going to be a slower more methodical downdraft on that to get to 10 basis points to 15 basis points over the

next quarter or two. So I don't have have the same opportunity that I had in the earlier part of the year to get any
kind of additional momentum out of interest expense.
Loan yields, we think they're going to hold. We hope they're going to hold. There's probably some more downdraft
there. But all things considered, Brett, we just believe that the second half of the year, my NII number ought to be
fairly close to what my – what the first half of the year [ph] on my – was (00:59:35).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Does that make sense?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Yeah. Yeah. I know there's a lot of moving pieces to it. So, I understand the guidance. The other thing I wanted to
ask was just you've had questions around BHG and sustainability of the recent trend and production. 3Q is
actually typically their strongest quarter. Was there any inkling that maybe 2Q pull forward some volume from 3Q,
or can you talk maybe about – just thinking about, obviously, really strong numbers but it would seem like 3Q is
typically where you really have the growth. Any thoughts around seasonality?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I've got no feedback from them on that point. I don't think there was any pull through 3Q volume into 2Q. I
don't think there was any kind of acceleration there. So, we believe that they gave us a 40% kind of pre-tax
growth number this year. So, based on what we're seeing, that's very doable.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q

Hey, Catherine.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Hi, Catherine.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Maybe one question on credit. There's a lot of conversations today about reserve levels kind of heading back
towards the day one CECL number, which I think for you is about 67 basis point. How do you think, Harold, about
– do you think that feels low? Do you feel like you'll get that level? Or where do you feel like [indiscernible]
(01:01:26) the reserve ratio may bottom?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I don't know. I don't think we'll get that low, Catherine, to be candid. When we're in that area, our reserve
levels were at the low end of the peer group. So we're not targeting anywhere near that number. But we do think
we've got some more room to go with respect to our allowance. We've been able to march it down so far, and we
think we're going to be able to march it down some more. But I don't think we'll see that 70 basis point number
you're talking about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then back to the question on the NII guidance in the back half of the year. Is there any kind of change
to excess liquidity incorporated into that guidance? Or how should we think about the size of the balance sheet
outside of just the high-single-digit loan growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think my balance sheet will come up some over the next two quarters. We've got some opportunities to
get some more wholesale funding off our balance sheet. So that'll be – that'll come into it. But we're not looking to
do another big investment securities kind of transaction here in the second half. We'll just try to maintain what we
have.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. So, still core NII should still be up, it's just really lower PPP that is driving the second half of the year to be
kind of equal to the first half of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. That's it.

Okay. Got it. And then one last one, if I could. Any updated thoughts on how BHG is thinking about a liquidity
event? And what are their kind of pros and cons in thinking about the timing of that for this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think, like we've said all along, they continue to study the markets. And like we said, they're having fun but
they're not doing it for fun. They've increased their sophistication around whether the hedge funds or SPACs or
IPOs or whatever. So, there will be a liquidity event. I'm not sure when it's going to be. But the two founders that
remain in the company that have significant – they believe equity tied up in the company, will want to see a
liquidity event at some point and it's hard. You just can't blame them for that. We just don't know when it's going to
occur. They – it's their company. They get to kind of make those big decisions. We speak with them about it
periodically. And – but so far so good. The runway for growth for them appears to be pretty long.

Vilas Abraham Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey, guys. It's Vilas Abraham for Brock. Just a follow up on C&I. Just on utilization, what are you guys seeing now
relative to pre-pandemic levels? Has there been any kind of bounce there and what are your assumptions in
terms of the high-single-digit loan guide as far as that goes?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. That's a good question. We're not seeing any kind of increased utilization from commercial [ph] lines
(01:05:11). It's still pretty flattish over the last two quarters. So – and we're not anticipating that moving
significantly over the next two quarters. So, I don't know what you might be hearing from other banks. But for us,
it's kind of a non-event right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vilas Abraham Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And then just beneath the surface on that CRE portfolio, is it still payoffs there that's driving some of the
pressure and just competitive dynamics overall. Any commentary there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. We had another kind of big quarter for payoffs in the second quarter. We just have to have enough new
business to overcome it. But it was – it did accelerate some in the second quarter and commercial real estate was
part of it. So, I think the commercial real estate guys would tell you that they are seeing increased payoff traffic

with projects for Department of Finance, a lot sooner. I think that's just kind of the environment we're in and we
want to stay in. Terry, I don't know if you've got any.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think that's right. There's an immense amount of money available for permanent financing. And so,
generally most of our bank borrowers who are here on a recourse basis like to get an end to the long-term
product without recourse, and so, there's a ton of that money available right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vilas Abraham Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And just maybe one more. On deposit growth pretty sharp contrast in risk bearing deposit growth versus I
mean non-interest bearing. You know just outside of the CD paydowns, is there anything special going on there
that we should be aware of in terms of that divergence?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I don't think there's anything we typically have towards the end of the quarter some larger deposits come into the
bank, but I'm not aware of any big ones this quarter that I can kind of think about that come to mind right now.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think on that, Michael, I always hate these questions, would you ever go, you know, when you get in, then
[indiscernible] (01:08:41) never do something, that's not a good spot to be in. So, I don't know. So, [indiscernible]
(01:08:46) we would never do it. [ph] I would have said this (01:08:48). Our motivations have always been as
we've had discussions about that topic in the past is that there are two things that have been important to us in
terms of how we have liked our current ownership interest being less than majority interest. One is we like those
guys having more stakes than us that's a good spot because they're really good at it, and we will make sure
they're as interested as we are in its ongoing success.
And, two, honestly, we like the equity method accounting treatment. And so, [indiscernible] (01:09:23) buy more
or all of that would change all that and so forth. So, anyway, I don't mean to give a co-answer. Those are the
reasons that we've structured it the way we have. They seem to continue to make sense to me, but I wouldn't
want to rule out and say I will – we would never consider that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just as a follow-up back to loan growth. Obviously, great momentum. This
quarter you've made a bunch of hires. You reiterated the high kind of single-digit growth for this year, and I
understand obviously this high is going to take time to ramp and everything like that. But any reason to think that
that outlook wouldn't be conservative and as we get into next year, and hopefully, the economy continues to
strengthen that you wouldn't be above that? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think obviously where the economy did strengthen and economic loan demand pick up, that would be a
boost to what we think we could produce. We're relying on modest economic loan demand and primarily market
share movement. Right now, the market share movement component shouldn't change drastically. But if the
economic loan demand portion changed up, then that would increase the likelihood of loan growth.

Hey, Dave.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Bishop Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hey. Harold, a quick question, I wasn't sure if I heard this right. But in the preamble, did I hear that, that one of the
equity investments that you had evaluation gain on or appreciation this quarter gave you a little bit of an insight
into your updated BHG valuation? If so, if I heard that right, could you – any color you can provide around that
number?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. We had – we run, I don't know how many we have, maybe 30 or 40, kind of investments in venture funds
and other kind of [indiscernible] (01:11:34) investments in addition to BHG. BHG is by far away the most
significant and largest. So – but we have others that we invested in over time. And one of those funds had a – at a
company, a portfolio company they developed a product, and as a result of that product [indiscernible] (01:11:58).
And as a result of that, they did a follow-on offering. And now, evaluation for that portfolio of company went up 2x
basically, and we got to participate in that. And so, that was the [ph] $2.4 million (01:12:14). I think we mentioned
$3.3 or sort of like that in the press release, because there were other companies that also had enhanced
valuations. And so, the [ph] $2.4 million (01:12:28) was just the biggest one of that, that 3-point – whatever it was
in the press release.

M. Terry Turner A

David J. Bishop Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Okay. Got it. Got it. Okay. I misheard. And then, turning to loan yields, just curious within your various markets
here if you're seeing any opportunities for better or even, conversely, are you seeing a more competitive pricing.
Just curious how pricing is shaping across your various markets?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I'll start, let Terry kind of finish. But loan yields are [indiscernible] (01:13:16) and have been for the last
couple of quarters. We can't get a yield curve that kind of – that stays stable for fixed rate credit, so we need that
to occur. But other than that, it's just – we're negotiating as hard as we can to keep those loan deals where they
are.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I don't think there's – I don't think it's a lot [indiscernible] (01:13:46) Harold's sort of said, we're pushing
hard, trying to keep the accountability and pressure in the system to do the best we can on pricing. But it's going
to be a slugfest, I think, for the remainder of the year. There's a lot of money [indiscernible] (01:14:01) on limited
number of deals. So...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Bishop Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Got it. Then one final question, and I realized payoffs and there can be some diverse granularity here. But I
noticed that Memphis has been down here the past couple of quarters. And, obviously, there's a lot of M&A in the
background with that market. Just curious any color you can provide on that market and how you view that market
holistically overall? Thanks.

Harold R. Carpenter A

Harold R. Carpenter A

Yeah. Well, our – we like the Memphis market. I think we believe we have and can continue to produce outsized
growth there. We're making really good headway. We've done well on the CRE segment for some time, but we're
making really good headwind on the C&I segment. And so, we've had a good number of relationship managers,
the national advisors as we call them in that market likely ahead most markets and we expect that to continue to
produce outsized growth.

Brian Martin Q

Hey. Just one follow-up, Harold, on that balance sheet question earlier, I guess did you say it was – your
expectation was that it was up? The balance sheet would be up, up slightly or down slightly? It was down slightly?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Up slightly over the next two quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Up slightly. Okay. All right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. And we're trying – we're trying to limit that as much as we can, so we'll try to get rid of our wholesale
deposits that come due and we'll work with other depositors and try to get rates down as fast as we can.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah. Okay. And then just to be clear, on the PPP, I appreciate the comments on being less the next couple of
quarters. But your expectation would be that the majority of that $48 million or so is likely collected in back half of
the year. I mean some of it bleeds into next year, but the bulk of it your expectation or you hope to get it this year.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2021
Yeah. We should be at most of the $48 million that's left in the next two quarters, but that will be, as you schedule
it out, will be less than what we've collected in the second quarter – part of the third and fourth quarter will be less
than what's in the second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Yep. Okay. And then you talked about the plan on the hotel upgrades. I guess, it sounds like there's
some pretty good opportunity for upgrades in the next couple of quarters, I guess if that plays out. Is that how you
think about it, and I guess and returning the classifieds and criticized and kind of bakes into the reserve release
continuing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think – yeah, that will have something to do with the reserve release. But we should expect some
upgrades this quarter. But I think most of the upgrades will likely be in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of
next year, because some of those hotel loans went through a modification process. And I think the due dates for
that or maturity dates on those loans are coming up here in the fourth quarter, in the first quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. That's...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Brian, I think the other thing that might be important there is that it's – very few of those loans are classified
assets, vast majority are criticized assets. And so, we're expecting the migration from criticized to pass.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. I appreciate that, Terry. And then, maybe Harold, just outside of the NII guidance, just the core
margin. If you strip out the – you get the drags in the PPP, but just kind of the core NIM ex the PPP, I guess, how
are you thinking about that, the next couple of quarters? I know you mentioned the sub debt and some other
items and the cost of funds moving modestly lower, just a little bit slower down – downdraft here?

Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
We're just – I – we don't see it going up. We're going to try to keep it flat. I don't have as much room on deposit
costs to pick up any kind of additional increase in margins from that. So, it will all depend on how well we do on
loan pricing over the next couple of quarters.
