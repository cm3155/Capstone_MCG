Q2 2022 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2022
Stacy C. Kymes
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Good morning and thanks for joining us to discuss BOK Financial's second quarter financial results. Starting on
slide 4, second quarter net income was $133 million or $1.96 per diluted share. The quarter represented strong
earnings performance from across the company, demonstrating both our diversity and breadth.
Core average loan balances grew $714 million during the quarter, with growth spread among geography and loan
types. More impactful to this quarter's results was the 35 basis point increase in our average loan yields. Our loan
portfolio has begun to reprice in response to the recent increases in short-term rates. As we've noted previously,
our balance sheet is asset-sensitive with the majority of our commercial and commercial real estate loans
repricing in a year or less.
Brokerage and trading revenues increased, led by institutional trading fees and a new quarterly high in energy
hedging, and the second best quarter historically from commercial loan syndication fees. Fiduciary and asset
management fees grew $3.4 million as our waivers and our money market funds declined as short-term rates
increased. Transaction card and deposit service charges, both grew linked quarter, $2.7 million and $1.5 million,
respectively.
Our period-end core loan balances grew $711 million or 3.5% linked quarter, but even more impressive with our
growth in unfunded loan commitments. Those grew $979 million or 7.8% linked quarter. The overall credit quality
of our loan book continues to be outstanding with additional improvement again this quarter.
Turning to slide 5, C&I loan balances increased 5.4% linked quarter, with an increase in C&I commitments of
4.4%. Average deposits decreased $1.8 billion this quarter with virtually all of that in interest-bearing balances.
These declines were consistent with our expectations given the actions of the Federal Reserve to increase short-
term rates. Compared to June 30, 2021, period-end balances are still $1.2 billion or 3.1% higher than last year,
with a favorable mix shift to non-interest-bearing balances.
Assets under management or in custody in our Wealth Management group fell slightly this quarter, down 5% to
$96 billion. The change was market value-driven, primarily due to equities, which account for a third of the assets
under management or administration.
I'll provide additional perspective on the results before starting the Q&A session. But now, Marc Maun will review
the loan portfolio and our credit metrics in more detail. I'll turn the call over to Marc.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun
Executive Vice President-Regional Banks, BOK Financial Corp.
Thanks, Stacy. Turning to slide 7, period-end loans in our core loan portfolio were up – were $21.2 billion, up
3.5% linked quarter. Midway through the year, core loans have now grown $1.3 billion or 13% annualized. Total
C&I loans grew $696 million or 5.4% linked quarter with growth spread across our footprint.
Our Texas and Oklahoma markets produce combined core C&I growth of 6.8% linked quarter. Across the
markets, healthcare, energy and services were the primary sectors driving this quarter's solid C&I result. Although
commercial real estate growth was quiet this quarter, linked quarter commitments grew 7.5%, so we expect that
to translate into balance sheet growth over the next several quarters.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2022
Loans in the energy space continued their recent linked quarter growth trend, period-end balances grew $195
million and have increased $386 million since December 31. Linked quarter outstanding balances grew 6%, while
unfunded commitments increased 11% linked quarter, creating more opportunity for balanced growth as we look
to the quarters ahead.
Healthcare balances increased $255 million or 7.4% linked quarter, primarily driven by our senior housing sector.
Excluding energy and healthcare, core middle market C&I realized positive growth again this quarter, with linked
quarter growth of $245 million or 3.9%. C&I utilization rates did increase slightly this quarter, but have yet to return
to pre-COVID levels.
We still have significant capacity to increase outstanding loan balances as demand continues to come back online
without it being predicated on any new customer acquisition. A return to more normal utilization levels organically
adds $600 million of core C&I loans outside the anticipated growth in the specialty areas.
Based on the growth in balances and commitments over the last two quarters, combined with the geographic and
loan-type diversity, we are very confident in our ability to produce continued growth throughout the remainder of
this year.
Commercial real estate period-end balance growth slowed this quarter, following the strong first quarter
performance. Through June, balances have increased $275 million, an annualized rate of 14%. Commitments
grew $460 million or 7.5% linked quarter with year-to-date commitments up $855 million.
We have plenty of capital allocated for this space to grow balances this year, and given the low current utilization
level, a return to more normal funding levels could add several hundred million dollars in outstanding loan
balances within the next two to four quarters. We entered the year with a focus on growing top line revenue, and
the second quarter demonstrates the progress we are making on the lending front. We are confident that the
momentum we've experienced up to this point will continue and the resulting loan growth for 2022 will be one of
the best in our recent history.
Turning to slide 8, you can see that we continue to experience meaningful credit quality improvement across the
broader loan portfolio. Overall credit quality is the best we've seen in quite some time, far better than pre-
pandemic levels. Excluding loans guaranteed by US government agencies, non-performing assets fell $13 million
this quarter to $118 million. Excluding those guaranteed by US government agencies, non-accrual loans are now
$96 million.
As a percentage of tangible equity and loan loss reserves, our criticized assets are at levels not seen in the last
10 years. Our sustained trend of improving credit quality metrics was enough to offset any need for a credit loss
provision this quarter, which would have resulted from the strong loan growth and changes in our reasonable and
supportable forecasts, primarily related to the economic outlook from the Federal Reserve's actions to control
inflation.
Given our solid credit position today, a ratio of capital allocated to commercial real estate that's substantially less
than our peers, and a history of outperformance during past credit cycles, we believe we are well-positioned
should another economic slowdown materialize in the quarters ahead.
We realized net recoveries of $799,000 during the second quarter. Excluding PPP loans, net charge-offs have
dropped to an average of 6 basis points over the past four trailing quarters, which is far below our historic loss
range of 30 basis points to 40 basis points. Looking forward, we expect net charge-offs to continue to be low.

Excluding PPP loans, the combined allowance for credit losses was $283 million or 1.33% of outstanding loans at
quarter-end. We expect this ratio to migrate downward, though, continued strong loan growth will increasingly
influence the prospect of resuming a provision in future quarters.
I'll now turn the call over to Scott.

Chief Executive Officer-BOK Financial Securities, Inc. & Executive Vice President-Wealth Management, BOK Financial Corp.
Thanks, Marc. Turning to slide 10, total fees and commissions were $173 million for the second quarter, a $76
million increase from the first quarter. Institutional trading fees increased $66 million linked quarter, as we moved
past last quarter's volatility, returning us to more sustainable trading levels and revenues. Driven by increased
activity from our energy customers, our commodity and hedging activities had a record quarter with fees of $13
million, a $2.2 million increase from the record set last quarter. Commercial syndication fees recorded their
second best quarter ever with fees of $6.4 million, an increase of $3.3 million linked quarter.
Fiduciary and asset management fees increased $3.4 million linked quarter, primarily due to seasonal tax
preparation fees and growth in mutual fund fees and revenues, largely driven by increases in short-term interest
rates. Our assets under management or administration fell 5% linked quarter to $96 billion. This is primarily driven
by a 15% decline in the equity portion of the portfolio, with equities representing about a third of the total assets.
Despite the decline related to current market valuations, our strong sales activity in this space provided an offset
to that change with total assets under management or administration relatively flat to this time last year. Our
current mix of assets under management is 44% fixed income, 34% equities, 14% cash, and 8% alternatives.
Our relationship-centric business model is perfectly in touch with clients' needs today as we continue to navigate
through this market volatility. We believe the confidence and appreciation for financial advice we've earned from
institutions and individuals positions us well to serve our clients in this period of market uncertainty. Transaction
card revenue increased $2.7 million or 11% linked quarter as transaction volumes improved. Year-to-date card
revenues are up 8% compared to 2021. This is largely due to broader reopening of the US economy, driving
transaction volume, as well as some impact from inflation.
Deposit service charges increased $1.5 million this quarter, with growth once again equally split between our
commercial and consumer segments. Compared to second quarter last year, total service charges have grown
$2.6 million or 10%. Year-to-date, approximately 23% of the deposit service charge fees were consumer-related
overdraft fees. We expect to make changes in the fourth quarter of this year that will reduce consumer overdraft
fees by approximately $2.5 million per quarter.
Mortgage banking revenue decreased $5.3 million or 32% linked quarter, with production revenues down $5.6
million due to lower production volumes combined with narrowing margins. Mortgaging servicing fees increased
$277,000 this quarter and are 6% higher than the second quarter last year. During the last 12 months, we've
strategically acquired servicing for approximately $6 billion of unpaid principal balances. Mortgage production
volume decreased $102 million during the quarter to $306 million as the industry continues to face housing
inventory constraints and rising mortgage rates. The rise in mortgage rates has significantly impacted the
refinance market, resulting in only 19% of mortgage loans funded for sale this quarter, down from 45% in the first
quarter.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2022
I'll now turn the call over to Steven to highlight our net interest margin dynamics and the important balance sheet
items for the quarter. Steven?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Thanks, Scott. Turning to slide 12, second quarter net interest revenue was $274 million, a $5.6 million increase
from last quarter. Interest and fees on loans increased $25.8 million linked quarter, largely due to a 35-basis-point
increase in loan yields. Average loan balances increased $594 million. Loan yields increased as our variable loan
rates began to reprice in response to the recent increase in short-term interest rates.
Our balance sheet is asset sensitive, with the majority of our commercial and commercial real estate loans
repricing in a year or less. Interest on our trading securities fell $18 million as we reduced the average trading
securities $4.4 billion linked quarter. While interest income on trading securities fell this quarter, this was more
than offset with an increase in institutional trading fees recognized in fees and commissions. Interest income on
the available-for-sale and investment portfolios increased $2 million linked quarter, primarily due to a 7-basis-point
increase in the average yield on the available-for-sale portfolio due to higher reinvestment rates.
During the second quarter, we moved $2.4 billion in securities from available-for-sale to held-for-investment. This
is the primary driver, $416 million linked quarter increase in the investment portfolio and the $834 million decrease
in the available-for-sale portfolio. Due to the timing of those transfers, the balance sheet impact of that
repositioning will become more apparent when we report third quarter results. Total interest expense increased
$5.5 million during the second quarter, primarily due to a 10 basis point increase in the average rate of interest-
bearing liabilities, while those related to average balances fell $2.5 billion. The average effective rate of interest-
bearing deposits increased 12 basis points this quarter.
Average earning assets decreased $4.4 billion compared to the last quarter, primarily due to the intentional
decline in the trading securities portfolio used to support our brokerage and trading business we just noted.
Excluding the $120 million linked quarter decline in PPP loans, average loan balances increased $714 million.
Interest-bearing cash decreased $207 million. Average total deposits declined $1.8 billion with non-interest
bearing deposits increasing $140 million and interest-bearing balances decreasing $1.9 billion this quarter, which
was consistent with our expectations given the movement in short-term interest rates.
Net interest margin was 2.76%, a 32 basis point increase from the previous quarter, with the increase, the
combination of the $4.4 billion linked quarter decline in earning assets and the 35 basis point increase in loan
yields. The yield on our trading portfolio increased 29 basis points as we repositioned that portfolio with higher
coupon bonds.
With our current asset-sensitive position and given expectations for further increases in short-term rates as the
Fed continues their aggressive posture against inflation, we expect to capture significant benefit throughout the
remainder of 2022. If the Fed moves at least 25 basis points in July, then we will materially move beyond the
impact of loan floors, and would anticipate topping a 3% margin in late third or early fourth quarter.
Turning to slide 13, we highlight further our asset-sensitive balance sheet position and expect our performance in
a rising rate environment to be similar to that experienced during the last rate hiking cycle from 2015 to 2019.
Using our standard modeling, assuming a parallel shift up 200 basis points gradually over 12 months, net interest
revenue would increase 5.2% or approximately $67 million. Over the following 12 months, the total benefit
increase is 12.1% or $167 million. However, with a flatter yield curve expected versus a parallel shift up, our

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2022
estimates for up 200 basis points would be approximately half those levels. I'll provide more color in a moment
when I talk about our specific guidance for net interest income.
On slide 14, you can see that our liquidity position remains very strong. Our loan-to-deposit ratio increased to
55% this quarter from 52% at March 31 due to the combined impact of an $807 million decrease in total deposits
and a $617 million increase in loan balances this quarter. Our significant on-balance sheet liquidity leaves us well-
positioned to meet future increase in customer loan demand.
Our capital position remains strong as well, with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.6%, well above regulatory
thresholds. With such strong capital levels, we once again were active with share repurchase, opportunistically
repurchasing 294,000 shares at an average price of $82.98 per share in the open market. At the current price
level, we will continue to be active in repurchasing shares during the third quarter.
Turning to slide 15, linked quarter total expenses decreased $4 million. All of that decline is coming from
personnel expense. Variable compensation expense decreased $3.7 million and employee benefit expenses
decreased $2.4 million due to seasonal decrease in payroll taxes. These decreases were partially offset by a $1.8
million increase in regular compensation expense as we recognized the full quarter of expense related to annual
merit increases.
We have been successful in managing staffing costs during the tight labor market, but realize that current market
conditions continue to present a risk going forward. Non-personnel expense was flat linked-quarter with most
expense categories having slight increases compared to the first quarter, offset by lower occupancy expense.
On slide 16, I'll provide guidance on a few areas as we begin the second half of 2022. We expect loan growth to
continue the solid performance seen in the first and second quarters, with period-end point-to-point total loan
growth for the year approaching a double-digit rate. We expect a continued reduction in deposit balances; with the
point-to-point decline in the upper single-digit range for 2022. Considering accelerated loan growth and moderate
pressure on deposits, our liquidity position is expected to remain strong with a loan-to-deposit ratio of
approximately 60% by year-end.
Considering the items noted above and modeling an additional 175 basis point increase in short-term rates during
2022 consistent with a flattening forward curve, we expect core net interest income, excluding the impact of PPP
loans year-over-year, to grow approximately 7% versus the prior year. Core net interest margin should expand
throughout the remainder of 2022, and given this environment, should exceed 3% before year-end. In fact, our
June margin was 2.9%.
We expect to maintain the available-for-sale securities portfolio flat for the remainder of the year and reinvest
cash flows at current rates. No additional transfers to held-to-maturity are anticipated. Total fee revenues are
expected to be 5% to 10% lower than second quarter results, as we saw record derivative activity, seasonality of
tax fees, and we'll continue pressure with mortgage banking into the third quarter.
Total fee revenues as a percent of total revenues is expected to remain near 35% during 2022. Total operating
expense should be approximately $280 million to $285 million per quarter for the remainder of 2022, bringing total
expenses for the year 5% below 2021, and our efficiency ratio below our corporate goal of 60% by the end of the
year.
Our current combined loan loss reserve as a percentage of loan balances is 1.33%. We expect this ratio to
migrate downward, though continued loan growth at the current pace will increase the probability of resuming a

provision in future quarters. We expect to continue opportunistic quarterly share repurchases at the upper level of
the dollar range spent over the past several quarters.
I'll now turn the call back over to Stacy for closing commentary.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Thanks, Steven. I'm very excited about this quarter's results. We ended the year with a focus on growing top line
revenue, and our team is delivering those results across the board. Our lending teams have really hit their stride,
not only growing our balance sheet this quarter, but also creating opportunities for future growth, as commitment
growth outpaced loan fundings. This is especially impressive given our commercial lending group and their
support teams completed significant transformational projects during the quarter. We successfully implemented a
new loan origination platform, significantly updated our Treasury platform and introduced a commercial portal.
From an operational and efficiency standpoint, this positions us well to leverage those investments going forward.
Although revenues from our mortgage-focused business lines have slowed as markets adjust to rising mortgage
rates, we've taken appropriate steps to adapt to the new environment. We've reset our balance sheet strategy for
mortgage-related trading securities, and we've done some surgical rightsizing of our expenses within our
mortgage origination space.
Despite the impact from equity markets, our fiduciary fees continued to grow, as rising rates eliminate fee waivers
and our sales force generates new business. Transaction card revenues continued to grow, as well as our
ancillary lending fees related to commodity hedging and syndication activity. We achieved all this with a continued
emphasis on expense control.
We've been intentional about positioning our balance sheet to benefit from rising rates with evidence this quarter
as core loan yields increased materially, and we expect that to continue. As the Federal Reserve moves
aggressively to increase short-term interest rates, we will see expanding margins and revenue. Credit quality just
keeps getting better and is the best we've experienced in a long time, though it is likely unsustainable. The
business profile of our geographic footprint remains exceptional, and when combined with BOKF's long-held
credit discipline, will serve us well if the economy slows in future periods.
With that, we're pleased to take your questions. Operator?

Good morning, Brady.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I just wanted to start with the guidance for spread income, which is now 7% growth. I think before it was 9%
growth. So, it was revised a little lower, which was just a little surprising. It seems like with rates doing what
they're doing, the NII commentary is better, so I just wanted to see kind of why the change there. I know you're
expecting deposit balances to be a little lower, so maybe that has something to do with it, but loan growth is still
robust. So, maybe just the dynamics that went into kind of the lower NII guide.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. Let me clarify that a little bit because really the dynamics of what's going on have really not changed. We
just lowered the trading portfolio from the first quarter to the second quarter, and then on into our forecast. So, we
had, I think, in the first quarter about $8 billion average in our trading portfolio, and going forward, it's going to be
about $4 billion.
So that trading portfolio earns a nice spread and contributes to net interest income. So, we dropped that balance.
That's what went from the – why it went from 9% to 7%. But my expectation for the third quarter is that NII should
grow somewhere between $15 million and $20 million for the next couple of quarters each. You only saw it grow
about $6 million this quarter because of that drop in the trading portfolio. So now that we've reset that position for
that portfolio within the dynamics of improvement in loan spreads and yields, our continued control and deposit
costs, and overall asset sensitivity, we're going to grow net interest income $15 million to $20 million for the next
couple of quarters.

And hopefully that clarifies a little bit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
That does. Thank you. And then just next on the provision, I mean, you guys have had a negative to zero
provision for a while now. It sounds like you could have something in that line item going forward. But I just really
wondered about the reserve and reserves are 133 basis points in percentage terms. I think you said that could
continue to go down from here. I was just wondering how you think about kind of the floor on where that reserve
could land over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. Well, it's hard to anticipate a floor. But I do see it migrating down towards that kind of day one CECL level
which is [ph] 1.20 (00:28:45). Now whether we get there, I don't know. I think what we wanted to share is that we
likely will need to provide at some point in the future for the loan growth that we've got. I mean, our loan growth is
significant and who knows what the economic outlook will be the next quarter or two. But the loan growth itself will
drive likely some need for provisioning just because of the size of it. But all that dynamic together, I still believe
the [ph] 1.33 (00:29:15) slides downward a bit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then finally for me, I mean, I've heard your comments about overdraft − some overdraft changes being
implemented in the fourth quarter which will take $2.5 million a quarter away from fee income. Are you thinking
about anything on the NSF side, or are there any other changes that you're thinking about that would impact
service charges beyond that $2.5 million per quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
No, that's pretty encompassing. We'll announce those as we get into the late third or early fourth quarter, but we
wanted to signal that they will have an impact. It's not a huge number for us. The consumer overdraft NSF
charges aren't a terribly large number for us. I think for the year, it's about $21 million or $22 million a year in fee
revenue. So, it'll impact that about $2.5 million a quarter with some changes starting in the fourth quarter. But that
will largely be related to overdraft and NSF fees.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

I guess maybe looking at loan growth, especially C&I growth, you're putting up some great numbers there. When
you look at that growth in commitments, is that new customers and taking market share or is that your customers
just feeling more optimistic and dropping and creating new lines and creating new projects to look for?

Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banks, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. This is Marc Maun. I would say it's a combination of both. We've been successful in acquiring new
customers and as well as seeing some of our customers expand, take advantage of the opportunities now with
the economy and put – take on some of the projects they may have put off for a while. And I think what – the key
here is that the breadth of our growth is across all our geographies and really all our lines of business on the
commercial side and especially on the C&I side. So we've just seen an overall positive impact going for the last
six months, nine months, and we expect it to continue.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, this is Stacy, and I think Marc said that well. What I was most encouraged about was how widespread the
growth was across the geographies and loan types. It wasn't one particular segment that was kind of carrying the
day, but really widespread across all of our geographies and different loan types. And so that was really
encouraging and we're encouraged about the pipeline that we see going into the last half of this year as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
When you look at that pipeline or that growth outlook for the year, does that assume that the utilization rate
normalizes this year or starts to normalize, or is that just looking at the pipeline and assuming a flat utilization
rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banks, BOK Financial Corp.
No, we're not assuming that the utilization is going to normalize. We're looking at just general growth from our
customer base, new customer relationships, as well as expansion opportunities to add to the portfolio. If we are
able to get increased utilization, it will just benefit us further.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then I guess shifting on to the deposit side, how should we think about that deposit mix with the overall
balance – deposit balance going down? Should we – are you still able to grow DDA going forward? And is that
also coming from just new relationships?

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2022
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, it appears that way. I mean, we've seen growth in DDA every quarter. Even in the consumer portfolio this
quarter, it grew. So, I don't anticipate that that drops that significantly. I think you will have migration with some of
your wealth customers and maybe some of your commercial customers who find somewhere else to put their
dollars to earn a little bit higher with higher rates. So that's why we've kind of guided to an overall decline in
deposits by the end of the year. But the DDA in the mix has held exceptionally strong and I don't know that I see
that changing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Now, this is Stacy. I think that the – our commercial and Treasury platform continues to perform very well, and our
sales team there are exceptional. And our DDA growth has been very good and we don't see how that materially
changes here as we move forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banks, BOK Financial Corp.
And this is Marc, I'll only add one thing here. One of the things we've also seen is our treasury services revenue
stream on a P times V basis has been growing at double-digit rate for the last 18 months. So, that could be driving
some of that DDA growth as well because our service charges are partially covered by some of those balances.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then, I guess historically, when you look at the deposit rate deposit data, you highlighted 30% through
the last cycle. If we see – I guess, what could cause that to go higher than 30%? And if we do get the next 75 or
higher basis point move, could we get to that level in short order here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, [ph] let me kind of (00:34:46) clarify. So the first 150 basis point increase, which we've already seen,
our beta was about 14%. The next 175 basis point increase that we have built in our forecast, the beta is closer to
40%. So, the average for the year is close to that 30 basis points that we're talking about. But to your point, future
rate increases, which we have built in our forecast, do carry a higher beta up to that 40% level is what we're
anticipating. And we'll just see if that plays out, but we think that should be pretty close to what happens.

Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banks, BOK Financial Corp.
Hello, Brett.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Wanted to first ask, it was good to see the rebound in all the fee income lines of business. And I guess I was a
little surprised that the wealth management fees were up despite the decline in the AUM. Can you talk maybe
about the dynamics there and then maybe just a little better outlook on that line item in particular?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Bradley Grauer A
Chief Executive Officer-BOK Financial Securities, Inc. & Executive Vice President-Wealth Management, BOK Financial Corp.
Sure. I'll take a first stab at that. This is Scott. A couple of factors that moved the needle probably most
significantly in the quarter we talked about a bit. One is when you think about 14% of our total AUMA being in
cash, we started to – we were able to stop waiving fees on our money market funds. We increased our revenue
share on outside money market funds. So that gave us lift in the quarter.
Additionally, we had a significant tax seasonal inflow in the quarter which helped and aided. And so I think all of
that, coupled with, as Stacy mentioned, we had very strong new sales, new relationships really across the various
lines of wealth management for the quarter. And then the only drag on that was the roughly one-third that
experienced the most significant market decline in the quarter which were the equity components. So, really that's
kind of the dynamic that we saw playing out in the course of the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. Great. That's helpful, Scott. And then I wanted to just to make sure I understood the loan growth guidance.
It sounds like you're talking about loan growth being similar in the back half to the first half, but given the guidance
for it to be approaching double-digit, it does assume somewhat of a slowdown. Are we − I assume we are
expecting a bit of a slowdown relative to the second quarter and 3Q, or I'm not sure if I understand specific
guidance around the back half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banks, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, we've experienced 12% to 13% annualized growth the last two quarters and that's very strong. And I'm a
little reluctant to put 12% out there. I do think our commercial portfolio likely grows that level. Our wealth portfolio
has grown well, but not at that level or likely not at that level going forward. So, I don't know, you take all of it
together, I think our guidance is around that double-digit mark. But I was a little reluctant to put 13% loan growth
out, not knowing exactly what the economy is going to do in the third and fourth quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
That's really where the conservatism...

Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Brett, that's really where the conservatism is. I think that – there's a lot of momentum there and the pipelines are
very good. And I think as we look at that, we just kind of wanted to think about that with a little bit of conservatism
just because particularly as you get into the fourth quarter, it's hard to know exactly what borrower behavior will
be. And so, we're awfully optimistic about what we've done and what the pipeline looks like going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then just lastly for me on expenses and the guidance for $280 million to $285 million for
the back half of the year, is that a reflection of personnel expenses bumping back up [ph] following your
(00:39:15) compensation-related expenses in 2Q or can you give a little color on?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
I think you're likely going to see our stock price a little higher which is going to drive some variable comp in our
stock equity accruals. I think it also has an impact on our deferred compensation. Those two items that you saw
that we benefited from in the second quarter will likely turn the other direction and be a little bit higher than that
$273 million. That's why I'm pointing towards the $280 million number or a little more. I don't think it's going to be
general regular salaries or part time-type salaries. You saw $1.8 million increase because of merit increases in
the second quarter, and that's our timing for that. So, you won't have that recur in the third and fourth quarter. So,
I think it is personnel costs that drives it a little bit higher in the third and fourth quarter, but it's mostly variable
comp and deferred comp related.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC

Thanks. Good morning. I had two questions on the yields. First, could you just tell us how much is cash flowing
each quarter on the securities portfolio and what the reimbursement rates is versus the yields of the securities
running off?

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2022
Yeah. So, we got about $600 million of cash flow quarterly from the available-for-sale portfolio that we'll reinvest.
And they're going to be at just normal mortgage-backed security rates, which I don't know what those guys are
getting exactly today, but they're up close to 3%, I would say. But I can give you more of an exact answer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
And versus stuff that's rolling off?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, they're – yeah, I mean, definitely the 1.84% that you see in available-for-sale, that's going to migrate up.
Maybe it gets closer to 2% or so in the next quarter or so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. So, that loan yield increase is very impressive, 35 basis points. So, is there anything like interest recoveries
that elevated that that might revert a little bit next quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
No, there's not – there's nothing inside there that really boosted it kind of artificially, if you will. It's a pretty normal
rate, and I think you'll expect that to go higher. We'll see what the Fed does today, but most of these price
relatively quickly upward. And so, yeah, I expect good response in that overall portfolio yield as we move into the
third quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. And just my last question. Obviously, I have covered you guys for a while and you've never done it in the
past, but I'm just wondering if there's any thoughts on maybe adding swaps to manage the asset sensitivity and
maybe protect the margin when the Fed starts to cut rates, just given the asset sensitive balance sheet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Historically we've not done that. We've really used on-balance sheet [ph] out of (00:42:55) cash positions in our
securities portfolio. There may be a point where we decide we want to grow the portfolio and take off some asset
sensitivity. We're not at that point today. But, no, we're not contemplating putting on any swaps just at the
moment.

Good morning, guys.

Good morning.

Good morning, Jon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
This is probably for Stacy and Marc, just on energy. Sometimes we love it, sometimes we hate it. I think we love it
right now, and just if you guys could give us an overall view of how you feel about the energy markets today. I
know you're pretty consistent on it, but any more cautiousness on underwriting and any changes in your appetite
there, and just generally, what are you seeing from clients?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
I mean – this has been a really historic opportunity for BOK Financial to take market share, really strong growth in
syndication. We're leading a high percentage of the deals that we're involved with today. Customers understand
risk management practices. So, that's why you saw a record second quarter hedging revenue with commodity
prices spiking.
From an underwriting perspective, we feel very good about what we're doing. We have a cap on oil at $85 and a
cap on natural gas at $5.50. So, while we traditionally use the forward markets and a forward strip to price the
collateral, we have capped that at a level well below the current strip price. So we feel very good about that. It's
always been a great portfolio for us. Even in the downtimes that we've been through, we performed exceptionally
well. And actually, as people begin to think about the potential for a recession or a downturn in the economy, it's
really hard for us to envision a dramatic downturn in our footprint states given the support that commodities will
have in Oklahoma and Texas, Colorado and New Mexico in particular.
The likelihood that you could have a better regional outcome in this footprint that we are in than other parts of the
country is very high with commodity prices at the level that they are today. We've had six years of
underinvestment in the energy space and so this isn't something that is likely resolved in a short period of time. I
think commodity prices are going to stay higher on a relative basis. They could go lower than they are today,
particularly natural gas, but still on a relative basis be much higher than they've been the last several years and
support our local economies at a high level.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banks, BOK Financial Corp.
And Jon, I'll just add that as we've continued through this cycle, our hedging program continues to be substantial.
So both our oil weighted and gas weighted customers still are over weighted – or hedged in excess of 50% as
much as 90% into 20 − throughout 2023. So that gives us further comfort when we're looking at if there's a

potential drop in prices beyond our underwriting ability. So, we've maintained that kind of level going forward. And
as we ran our stress test, we ran a 40% discount to our entire − to the price deck in total and still saw very little
impact to the overall portfolio quality.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you. That's very helpful. And then just, Steven, now one for you. On slide 13 on your asset sensitivity...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
...help me understand that a little bit more. I think what you're saying is that 13 to 24-month number is in addition
to the 1 to 12-month number. Is that...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
That's right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
...the right way to look at it? Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
That's right. But also look at the asterisk there too because I don't want to over – I don't want to overestimate what
it could be. That is our normal parallel shift that we put in our 10-Q. But I'm being conservative here because I
think the flattening curve scenario is probably more likely and it would cut that number in half, but it is additive to
the previous year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. But the relative ratio holds is I guess what I'm kind of getting at.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Correct. Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And I guess bigger picture, you just look at the last few months and assuming we get 75 basis points today, that's
a little over 200 basis points. So, you're saying, yes, you're getting benefits today, but based on the repricing of
your portfolio, the benefits would really start to come third quarter of 2023. Even though we see the benefits
today, you're saying there's even more to come? Is that [indiscernible] (00:48:06)...

Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, I think that's true. I think that's correct. Yeah, we're set up to benefit significantly in the third and fourth
quarter if rates continue to rise. We think that's going to happen today. And that's our expectation. That's why I
think – I wanted to highlight earlier, I did in the call, we only grew $6 million between the two quarters, but that
wasn't because from dynamic with our sensitivity, that was more just the size of our trading book. And if you right-
size that and carry that on out for the rest of the quarters, then you've got a significant bump in NII to that $15
million to $20 million a quarter level. As long as loans continue to grow and the rates continue to rise, that's how
we're set up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Hello, Matt.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. Want to start on the NII guidance, 7% for the year. I think that excludes the impact of PPP.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
That's right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
I'm not sure you're talking about the same thing. Do you have what the dollar amount of the PPP fees were last
year, at least the starting point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, we do. Yeah. So, in 2021, we had a benefit of about $48 million, roughly, of NII and fees related to PPP
that would be in NII, and then this year it's about $8 million. So, there's a $40 million differential between the two
years. And if you account for that and look at what our NII forecast is, I think we'll grow 7% over last year.
Now, that's down from 9% that we said last quarter in our guidance, but we had not adjusted our trading portfolio
downward like we have today. And I think in the second quarter, that trading portfolio was $18 million different in
NII or interest revenue than what we had had in our previous forecast. So, that's why I modified that guidance.

next two quarters. Is that right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yes, that's correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Got it. I think you said within that, it assumes the trading portfolio maintains around that $4 billion level. Did
I hear that right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And I guess that would be a increase from the end-of-period level, but you're...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's around $4 billion to $5 billion average for those two quarters off of an $8 billion to $9 billion average we
had previously. So, that guidance adjusts for that portfolio being smaller.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Okay, it's helpful. And then I guess on the fees, good to see the rebound in the brokerage and credit line. I
want to make sure I appreciate kind of what's going on here. I think the trading line last quarter was a loss of $54
million. Do you have what the dollar amount for that line was in 2Q? And then, I guess how confident are you that
you've captured all the potential losses from – moving some of those lower coupon bonds off the balance sheet
that we've talked about last April?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, I can address that latter question. I know that we ended up selling out of all of those bonds in the quarter for
about $4 million to $5 million more than we had marked those bonds in the first quarter. So, we came out better,
certainly, in the sale of the tail of those bonds than what we had marked them when we closed last quarter. That's
the answer for the latter part of the question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banks, BOK Financial Corp.
And to your first part, Matt, page 10 in the investor deck really breaks out in more granular detail that brokerage
and trading line item. So you can see in the second quarter, it was $12 million in trading fees for the second
quarter of 2022.

Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And then just lastly on this topic, I guess, help me appreciate just increasing the size of that trading
portfolio back up to that [ph] $4 million to $5 million (00:52:36) that we brought it down quite a bit over the last few
quarters. Just strategically kind of we've increased it, we brought it back down, now we're bringing it back up. Just
help me appreciate that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Scott Bradley Grauer A
Chief Executive Officer-BOK Financial Securities, Inc. & Executive Vice President-Wealth Management, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So this is Scott. So I think that as we've talked about in terms of the factors that influence the just
precipitous rise in short rates in the first quarter and the market volatility, we had significant challenges to liquidity
in that mortgage-backed securities sector. And as Steven, yeah, detailed, we liquidated our lowest coupon
mortgage-backed securities in the first quarter because we believed, and I think rightly so, that we were going to
be entering a period with not just rising rates, but a significant amount of fixed income uncertainty.
So, we feel like as we've adjusted the size of that trading securities portfolio to now to that $4 billion to $5 billion
level, that positions us for the current market conditions. So, if we, over the course of the remainder of the year,
began to see rate and fixed income clarity and confidence return, then we'd consider returning it the larger levels
that it was previously. But in the current market conditions where we see a lot of uncertainty and volatility, we feel
very comfortable about that portfolio size to support our mortgage origination customer base, and the current kind
of outlook for rates and the flatness of the curve.

Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Matt, this is Stacy. I mean, if you think about just mortgage production overall, we're just – the market is just not
creating as much inventory with new paper being originated. And so, as a result of that, that activity is going to be
at a lower level than it was when you saw really strong mortgage markets overall in the third and fourth quarter
last year.
The other thing that we're starting to see some signs of life in is on the municipal trading side. That's picked up a
little bit here in the second quarter and that may help us a little bit as we move forward as well.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2022
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Hey. I wanted to ask about the components of loan growth back half of the year. I got on the call late, so I
apologize if you went through this. But my sense is that the pipeline and growth expectations remain pretty well
weighted to commercial. And I'm just curious about – in the commercial real estate side, we had a big kind of
surge, I guess, in the first quarter, and then we were flat 1Q to 2Q. Could you talk about what you're seeing in
terms of pipelines, transaction demand and if you're maybe seeing more projects that maybe don't pencil out at
higher rates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banks, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, this is Marc. I would say, first of all, to the latter part of that, we're certainly employing the same discipline
we've always employed. And so, we're trying to be selective and pick the best credits that we can. The volume of
opportunities is still there. We're just maybe being a little bit more selective. And then what we saw in the second
quarter was a lot of new commitments that we booked that are more construction-related and will not fund
immediately. But we expect those to start to fund out for the remainder of the year. So, that's when we'll see the
loan growth and outstandings is as those projects are funded going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Thank you. And in terms of the rate sensitivity, I just wonder if, Steven, you could tell us, in terms of the
78% of commercial and commercial real estate that's variable rate or [indiscernible] (00:56:39), could you drill a
little more into the variable rate, say, either prime or [indiscernible] (00:56:45) LIBOR to be a little more specific on
what – how we're thinking about [indiscernible] (00:56:48)...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
90% either is LIBOR or SOFR, and it's – most of it's centered around 30 day. So, it moves very quickly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Thank you very much.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 27-Jul-2022
Hey, Jennifer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Question on the senior housing portfolio. When I've asked some bankers over the last six months or so, what
kinds of loans they see as vulnerable if we go into a recession, some bankers have cited that area. I'm wondering
what your thoughts are and what you're seeing in your portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, I don't believe that the senior housing portfolio is as sensitive to recession as it is to more what the
government does around Medicare and Medicaid rates and what we've seen in terms of COVID and et cetera.
Those have been the headwinds that have been experienced. And the positive is that the Medicare and Medicaid
rates have been improving while the COVID situation is getting better, too. So we would expect occupancy to start
to improve. So, from that standpoint, I don't think the recession is going to change the demographics of the
population that would reduce the demand that would require senior housing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banks, BOK Financial Corp.
Jennifer, this is not a new portfolio for us and we've had it through previous recessions, including the 2008, 2009
more severe recession. And the credit outcomes in that portfolio have been very, very strong. We haven't made
any changes in our underwriting or liberalized how we look at that in any way. So I wouldn't expect a materially
different performance absent government changes in reimbursement for Medicare/Medicaid.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
