President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Good morning. Thanks for joining us to discuss BOK Financial's second quarter financial results. Starting on slide
4. Second quarter net income was $151 million or $2.27 per diluted share. I'm proud of the exceptional second
quarter financial results delivered across the board by our team. Wealth segment revenues set another record this
quarter and core loans reached an all-time high, led by the commercial and multifamily segments. Our growth
efforts are supported by the vitality of our geographic footprint as well as our diverse business model.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2023
Non-interest revenues were almost 40% of total revenues for the quarter. Using our capital and liquidity strength,
we are taking advantage of market and economic uncertainty to prudently grow. Our full service banking market
expansion into San Antonio and the addition of a fixed income sales and training office in Memphis are just two
more examples of how we are investing to build long-term shareholder value. That disciplined long view approach
has consistently been a distinct advantage for BOK Financial.
Turning to slide 5. Period-end core loan balances increased $488 million or 2.1% linked quarter, with growth
spread across C&I and commercial real estate. The deposit trajectory flattened and turned positive during the
quarter. Our loan-to-deposit ratio remained below 70% at the end of the quarter. Across the industry, deposit
costs have accelerated for all banks, including us as reported in our results. As Marty will detail later, our reported
net interest margin is diluted by the increased trading activity this quarter and our margin excluding the trading
activities [indiscernible] (00:03:00) 3.36%.
We're seeing early signs of loan spreads increasing as banks seek to contract and also work through the impact
of higher deposit costs and anticipated higher capital requirements for some. This impact will take many quarters
to become meaningfully apparent. Our efficiency ratio came in just below 59%, even with the shift in mix of non-
interest revenue. Credit quality remained very strong as we continue to grow our allowance and have a combined
reserve of 1.39%, which is notably above the median of our peer group. Assets under management or
administration grew $1.3 billion or 1.3% linked quarter and were up $7.6 billion or 8% compared to last year. The
market impact on cash, equities and fixed income, combined with the growth in new relationships is providing a
tailwind we did not have for this area in 2022.
Finally, we repurchased $266,000 shares this quarter as we balance opportunities for growth with attractive
repurchase valuations. I'll provide additional perspective on results before starting the Q&A session. But now,
Marc Maun will review the loan portfolio and our credit metrics in more detail. I'll turn the call over to Marc.

Thanks Stacy. Turning to slide 7. Period-end loans were $23.2 billion or up 2.1% linked quarter. Total C&I loans
increased $317 million or 2.2% linked quarter with year-over-year growth of $913 million or 6.7%. Commercial
real estate loans increased $155 million or 3.2% linked quarter and have increased $865 million or 21% year-
over-year. This effectively returns those balances to their 2020 level after experiencing significant paydown
activity in 2021. Compared to December 31, 2020, CRE balances have grown at a modest 2% annualized growth
rate. Growth this quarter was primarily driven by multifamily residential properties, with an increase of $139 million
or 10.2% linked quarter. Industrial facility loans grew $40 million or 3.1% linked quarter, which was offset with a
$40 million or 3.8% linked quarter decline in loans secured by office facilities. The year-over-year CRE growth of
$865 million was primarily driven from loans secured by multifamily residential properties and industrial facilities.
We have an internal limit of 185% of Tier 1 capital and reserves to total CRE commitments. And we're presently at
the upper limit of that range. We do expect continued growth in outstanding CRE balances as construction loans
fund up. As of June 30, CRE balances represented 21% of total outstanding loan balances, a ratio well below our
peers. Healthcare balances increased $92 million or 2.4% linked quarter and have grown $294 million or 8% year-
over-year, primarily driven by our senior housing sector. Healthcare sector loans represented 17% of total loans
at quarter-end. Energy balances increased $111 million or 3.3% linked quarter and have increased $116 million or
3.4% year-over-year with period-end balances representing 15% of total period-end loans. Combined services
and general business loans, our core C&I loans increased $114 million or 1.7% linked quarter with year-over-year
growth of $503 million or 7.7%. These combined categories represent 30% of our total loan portfolio. Year-over-

year loans have grown $1.9 billion or 9%. Excluding PPP loans, Q2 2023 extends the linked quarter loan growth
to seven consecutive quarters. Our pipeline suggest we have the current momentum to drive continued growth in
the loan portfolio throughout 2023 near our current pace.
Turning to slide 8, you can see that credit quality continues to be exceptionally good across the loan portfolio, well
below historical norms and pre-pandemic levels. Non-performing assets excluding those guaranteed by US
government agencies, increased $6 million this quarter. Non-accruing loans increased $12 million, driven by an
increase in energy related non-accruals, while repossessed assets fell $8 million. The level of uncertainty in the
economic outlook of our reasonable and supportable forecast remained high and the assumptions for commercial
real estate vacancy rates increase during the forecast period. Those economic factors, combined with second
quarter loan growth, supported a $17 million credit loss provision for the quarter. We remain in a solid credit
position today with the ratio of capital allocated to commercial real estate substantially less than our peers and
history of outperformance during the past credit cycles, we believe we are well-positioned should an economic
slowdown materialize in the quarters ahead.
The markets are more focused on the office segment of real estate, given the recent trends and workforce
preferences. So it remains an open question as to whether this will be sustained as employers continue to require
more time in the physical office. Our maturities are generally ratable over the next three to four years and we have
a mini-perm option if the markets are not conducive to long-term permanent financing. The average loan-to-value
ratio in the office space is below 65%, and average cash flow coverage exceeds 1.3 times, based on the most
recent semiannual review at the end of 2022.
Net charge-offs were $6.7 million or 12 basis points for the second quarter and have averaged 10 basis points
over the last 12 months. Far below our historic loss range of 30 to 40 basis points. Looking forward, we expect net
charge-offs to continue to be low. The combined allowance for credit losses was $323 million or 1.39% of
outstanding loans at quarter-end. The total combined allowance is available for losses and any apples-to-apples
industry comparison should include the combined reserves. We expect to maintain this ratio or to migrate slightly
upward as we expect loan growth to continue and the economic uncertainty to persist. I'll turn the call over to
Scott.

Thanks Marc. Turning to slide 10. Total fees and commissions were $200 million for the second quarter, up $14.5
million or 7.8% linked quarter. Our wealth segment set a new quarterly high for fees and commissions at $123
million this quarter, with the last four consecutive quarters representing four of the five highest quarters on record.
Trading fees and customer hedging revenues were the primary drivers of the linked quarter increase, up $9.3
million and $5.3 million respectively. Fiduciary and asset management fees increased $2.3 million, largely due to
seasonal tax service fees. The trading fee increase was primarily driven by $7.9 million improvement in our MBS
trading activities. Trading activity and margins improved coming off exceptionally low volume and high volatility in
the first quarter.
The desk has been able to increase volume by expanding coverage to downstream accounts as mortgage
originations slowly increase and market volatility returns to more normal levels. The $5.3 million customer hedging
revenue increase was driven by a record quarter for energy customer hedging fees, with linked quarter fees up
$4.7 million. Fees from other institutional trading activities increased $1.4 million linked quarter. Fiduciary and
asset management fees were $53 million for the second quarter, a 4.6% linked quarter increase.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2023
Our assets under management or administration were $103.6 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion or 1.3% linked
quarter. Growth was spread across most categories and primarily driven by improved asset values. Our asset mix
for assets under management or administration moved slightly this quarter with 43% fixed income, 33% equities,
15% cash and 9% alternatives. We believe our diversified mix of fee income is a strategic differentiator for us
when compared to our peers, especially during times of economic uncertainty. We consistently rank in the top
decile for fee income as a percentage of total net interest revenue and non-interest fee income. Our revenue mix
has averaged just over 36% during the last 12 months. That consistently supports a revenue stream that is
sustainable through a wide array of economic cycles. I'll now turn the call over to Marty.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Thank you, Scott. Turning to slide 12, second quarter net interest revenue was $322 million, a $3 million decrease
linked quarter. Net interest margin was 3%, a 45 basis point decrease versus Q1. It is important to note that 9
basis points of the 45 basis point margin decline was due to growth in trading assets. Our trading business grew
revenue and grew profitability, as you can see in the fee income trends, but was dilutive to net interest margin as
trading assets grew at narrower spreads relative to the rest of the balance sheet. When trading assets are higher
or the yield curve is flatter or inverted, which we experienced this quarter, the dilutive impact to net interest margin
is more significant. Net of the 9 basis point impact from trading, the remaining 36 basis point decline was driven
by the competitive deposit environment. As average interest bearing deposit costs increased 73 basis points, the
cumulative net interest bearing deposit beta increased to 54%, and DDA continued to shift into interest bearing,
although at a reduced pace.
DDA was 32% of total deposits at June 30. This slide shows net interest margin and net interest revenue with and
without the impact of the trading business to better highlight trends and comparability. For the second quarter of
2023, the net interest margin excluding the impact of trading assets, was at 3.36% versus 3.72% in the first
quarter. Growth in earning assets during the quarter was driven by loans and trading assets as the securities
portfolio remained stable to maintain our balanced interest rate risk position.
Turning to slide 13, liquidity and capital continue to be very strong on an absolute basis and versus peers. Total
deposits grew $714 million on a period-end basis and the loan-to-deposit ratio was 70% unchanged from the prior
quarter. Early in the second quarter, we saw a continued downward trend driven by April tax payments and some
price sensitive movements, though at a slower pace in the prior two quarters.
Balanced trends rebounded in early May and we grew $2 billion in deposits in the back half of the quarter. This
was consistent with our expectations and we are happy with the results in such a competitive environment. Our
tangible common equity ratio was 7.79%, down 67 basis points linked quarter due to balance sheet growth and
increases in interest rates, but up 16 basis points from year-end. Adjusted TCE, including the impact of unrealized
losses on held to maturity securities is 7.49%. CET1 is 12.1% and if adjusted for AOCI would be 9.9%. As
regulatory capital changes are being proposed for the industry, we believe that across the array of plausible
outcomes for banks in our size range, we have ample capital to support additional organic growth, while at the
same time allowing for continued share buyback.
During the second quarter, we repurchased 266,000 shares at an average price of $84.08 per share. Turning to
slide 14. Linked quarter total expenses increased by $12.9 million or 4.2%. Personnel expense grew $8.5 million,
with $4.1 million due to the full quarter effect of annual merit increases implemented on March 1. While cash
based incentive compensation grew $6.6 million due to new business production. These were partially offset by a
$2.5 million seasonal decrease in payroll taxes. Other operating expense grew $4.4 million, primarily due to a
5

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2023
$2.5 million increase in mortgage banking costs, driven by a seasonal increase in prepayments and a $1.1 million
increase due to the donation of an appreciated asset to the BOKF Foundation.
Year-over-year, total operating expense increased 16.5%. However, this includes the impact of market value
driven swings in deferred compensation and changes in the vesting assumptions for stock related compensation.
Excluding those two factors, total operating expense increased 11% compared to Q2 2022, with a 13% increase
in total personnel expense due to regular compensation and increased cash based compensation related to new
business production. Other operating expense increased 8%, primarily due to continued investments in
technology facilities and increased FDIC expense.
Turning to slide 15, I'll cover our expectations for 2023. We expect upper single-digit annualized loan growth.
Economic conditions in our geographic footprint remain favorable and continue to be supported by business in-
migration from other markets. Changes in the competitive environment for loans should be a tailwind. We expect
to continue holding our available for sale securities portfolio flat in 2023 to maintain a neutral interest rate risk
position. We expect total deposits to be stable or grow modestly and the loan-to-deposit ratio to remain in the low
70s. Currently, we are assuming one additional 25 basis point increase here in July before the Federal Reserve
pauses. We believe that the margin will migrate lower throughout 2023 as interest bearing deposit betas increase
and demand deposit balance attrition runs its course.
Net interest income is expected to be near $1.3 billion for2023. In aggregate, we expect total fees and
commissions revenue to approach $800 million for 2023. We expect expenses to be near or slightly above Q2
2023 levels and the efficiency ratio to migrate slightly above 60% throughout the remainder of 2023 as our
revenue mix shifts and our strategic market expansions ramp up. This does not include the impact of the FDIC
special assessment, which could be finalized in the second half of 2023.
Our combined allowance level is above the median of our peers and we expect to maintain a strong credit
reserve. Given our expectations for loan growth and the strength of our credit quality, we expect quarterly
provision expense similar to that in recent quarters. Changes in the economic outlook will impact our provision
expense. We expect to continue opportunistic share repurchases in the second half of the year. I'll now turn the
call back over to Stacy Kymes for closing commentary.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Thanks, Marty. As we have again demonstrated this quarter, strong risk management and strong financial results
are not mutually exclusive. We expect to do both well. Our talented teams collaborate well to ensure we grow our
company the right way, a way that is sustainable through all economic cycles. While the market is more focused
on capital and liquidity, I see this as a unique opportunity to use our strength in these areas to both organically
grow and invest in new markets, while others may be more internally focused. I continue to assert that we are in a
stage where investing in strong banks versus trading the sector matters. Banks with top of growth and diverse
business mix, meaningful core deposits and proven credit discipline should outperform. That certainly continues
to play out for us in 2023. We are focused on using that fantastic geographic footprint to grow both in the current
environment and in the years to come. With that, we are pleased to take your questions. Operator?

Hey, good morning.

Good morning, Jared.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Maybe starting with credit, with the expectation that provision could go higher based on growth in the economic
outlook. You call out the expectation for vacancy changes. Maybe can you spend a little time on where you think I
guess specifically office vacancy is and could go and how your markets are holding up with that return to work
and in your outlook on office. And I guess should we assume that office continues to decline and that provide
some opportunity to fund new CRE loans that are not in office.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banks, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. Jared, this is Marc. The office portfolio that we have, we've been reducing our office exposure over the last
several years. So, this is not new and we would expect to continue it to continue to decline. If we look at our
footprint, our overall markets, we think are in great shape. I mean you're looking at markets that have performed
very well in multiple economic downturns. When we're looking at the economic outlook, we're looking at its impact
on the overall economy as opposed specifically to our portfolio. And we would expect that we can maintain this
level of performance on the CRE portfolio going forward as [ph] our (00:22:02) focus has been on multifamily and
industrial, which have held up very well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. If you're looking at the forward guidance and trying to intimate maybe that there could be higher provision
expenses, that's not how we see it. I think that – we think that we reflected future potential outlook in CRE and
how we formulated our allowance methodology so that the forward-looking aspect of potential higher levels of
office vacancies is really how we supported the allowance this quarter. We're not trying to foreshadow that
provision levels could be higher in future periods. In fact, our guidance was kind of near current levels depending
on the economic outlook. Certainly, should the economic outlook improve and provision levels could even come
down from here. So, it's really just a function of how we see the economy playing out in future periods.

Okay. That's great color. Thanks. I guess shifting to deposits and funding, you highlighted that there was strong
trends in deposits in the second half of the quarter. How sustainable squaring that with the broader view of lower
growth on deposits for the year? Should we assume that, that growth helps you remix deposits or how should we
think about deposit mix going through the rest of the year with that growth outlook?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, I think that deposit growth should remain on an upward trend here with some noise within there. I think on
the mix side, DDA is probably the more interesting question and we really saw the DDA mix shift slowed down
appreciably in May and June. In fact, June average and June ending DDA balances were about the same. So that
trend actually turn reasonably favorable in the back half of the quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And do you think that, that could – that we've sort of found the bottom here on DDA then?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. We – I don't know if I'd call it precisely the bottom. It's certainly, those trends are very favorable. You could
have just a little bit more given, another Fed hike here. You can have a little bit more. But, those trends looked
very good in the last two months.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then I guess finally for me, when we look at the buyback and your comments about opportunistic
buyback. Is that really more opportunistic based on price or is that opportunistic based on alternative uses of
capital at any given sort of point in the quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. Those are the two factors. I mean, we're just trying to maximize shareholder value with how we do that.
And price is a factor. And to the extent that our outlook is for strong organic growth opportunities to be present of
– couple of quarters going to make sure that we've got sufficient wherewithal to support that. And that's obviously
first in the pecking order. But, that's kind of how we do the calculus.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Jared before the kind of first quarter in the industry, the most common question was, what are you going to do
with all your excess capital? So, we're obviously think that long-term we probably do have a little bit of excess
capital to deploy. Share buybacks are part of that. But we're being a little bit careful maybe in this environment, at
least for the near-term.

Okay. Thanks. And I guess maybe just circling back on the deposits, in terms of your expectation for beta, how
should we be thinking about cumulative data going through with the potential or the expectation for one more
hike?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, we do think that cumulative beta does keep moving up here. We were at 54% this quarter and our
assumption that's within our guide is that across the 60% and gets up into the 63%, 64% territory by the end of
the year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. I would agree with Marty, but I think the cumulative beta over the life of the cycle is going to be kind of
where we said it was going to be all along, somewhere in that 40% to 50% range.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Maybe a question for you, Marty, when I do the math on the margin, it seems like there's a little bit of pressure
coming, but maybe not that material. Can you confirm that just how much pressure do you think is ahead in the
net interest margin? And what do you think the cadence might look like for the next couple of quarters, assuming
the Fed's done today?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, that's right. And that is our base assumption. And maybe the best way to walk through that is to talk
through net interest revenue, kind of what the pluses and minuses are from here because like June, net interest
revenue for the month of June was $106 million. And so, if you kind of start from that run rate, loan growth is
going to be a plus obviously. Bond portfolio repricing is going to be a plus. In Q2, we saw $420 million of principal
cash flows runoff at about a $278 million runoff yield, and we're reinvesting that around $485 million for the
second quarter. And you'll see that trend you know continue through future quarters.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2023
And even within the fixed rate part of loan portfolio, that was small, you've got the same dynamic going on there
that provides a lift and we'll continue to provide lift. The deposit betas, we're at 54% cumulative right now. That
will continue to bleed up here as you get another rate hike. And then, you just get a little bit of residual carry
forward and the July rate hike that doesn't really independently move the needle that much. And then as you're
talking about before the DDA mix shift, that's really slowed down a fair amount. So that impact gets a lot smaller.
So, if you look at those pieces, the DDA and the deposit reprice are declining effects that are getting close to
depending running their course here. And then the loan growth is a growing effect over time and the bond
portfolio reprice, that's a declining effect over time, but it lasts a while. So, but, that kind of gives you a little bit of a
color around how that plays out over the next couple of quarters.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
And generally, we're focusing on net interest revenue versus net interest margin because the trading side of the
trading portfolio will greatly influence that margin. And so, it's easier for us to think about it in terms of net interest
revenue because if the activity is strong and the trading portfolio expands, obviously, the net interest margin
impact that is very dilutive. And so, it could it influenced by that, but that's going to benefit us on the B side, should
that trading portfolio continue to perform as it has been.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. I do want to ask, got a question on that. But just one comment you made was
you grew $2 billion in deposits later in the quarter. What was the driver of that? And was it higher rate deposits or
was it more client driven or help us understand what that was?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, that's mostly commercial and wealth driven, to a lesser extent consumer. But, largely our, what we
talked about last quarter, just making sure that we've got price competitive offerings throughout the footprint that
compete with the alternatives that our customer base have in those segments. And so, we're just yeah making
sure that our price points are at market, at all price points. And that's what drove it.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2023
Right. Absolutely. So, in the first quarter, when we saw a lot of kind of external shocks to the fixed income market,
we had a very – the Fed was in the midst of very active rate hikes. We saw bid-ask spreads really widen out in the
first quarter and we saw dwindling to very, very historically low mortgage origination. So, as we've moved into the
second quarter, as we mentioned, we've seen a pickup as the reality of 5%, 6% plus mortgage rate settles into
the market for home buyers, albeit still a shortage of inventory. We're seeing rate kind of expectations settle in,
which has increased mortgage origination. We've seen the moves whether the announcement today is one more
or two more rate hikes. We're clearly further into the Fed rate hike cycle, which creates a better appetite of our
institutional buyers of mortgage-backed securities and all fixed income products to position their portfolios. So,
we've seen kind of the combination of better outlook and certainty in the fixed income markets, coupled with little
bit better flow on the mortgage backed security side. So, those factors have given us better confidence in kind of
resuming our previous levels of securities inventory levels.

Stacy C. Kymes A

And if you think about it from an investment portfolio management position, if you know you're toward the end of
the hiking cycle, whether it's today or today plus one more, you begin to get more confident in repositioning your
portfolio because you don't think, well, I'm just, this is going to keep happening. And so, I'm not – [indiscernible]
(00:32:54) just going to keep trading into that that could optimistically help us out in the second half of the year if
the market participants believe the Fed is done or near done.

Yeah okay. Clearly, first quarter was abnormal, but is this maybe an impossible question? Does this feel more
normal?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
It does. And I think that, as Marty indicated, our levels of trading securities, our balances, there appear to be more
business as usual. So we look for these levels to be sustainable given the current rate environment and the
appetite for repositioning on the curve.

Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, thank you. Good morning, guys.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Good morning, Brady.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Well, I understand the dynamics of having a net interest margin that moves a little lower in the back half of this
year. But I'm wondering, as we look to next year, the Fed will be done. Deposit costs will probably have peaked.
Could you see an expanding net interest margin into next year just because your asset reprice is higher and the
NIM could be actually headed higher next year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So that's part one. I would again focus on net interest revenues, the way to think about next year and if you
can play out the comments that I made earlier. You can see that the growth trend and the percentage sure is
possible to see that higher, especially if you get less of an inverted curve, that's going to help as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
You've got a couple of factors there. I think Marty's reinvestment rate where we're getting, what, roughly $400
million a quarter and cash flow from the securities portfolio that's reinvesting at 250 to 300 basis points higher
than what we're receiving today. That's going to help you a little bit. The trepidation in answering the question is
really just understanding how deposit behavior is going to be as we grind higher for longer. If we're through the
worst of that from an industry perspective, then I think you're right. There's upward opportunity on the margin if
deposit pricing continues to grind higher in a more meaningful way, then then that could be the offset to some of
the favorable benefits that we see.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2023
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. And then, intra quarter, you guys had a couple of announcements expanding into San Antonio, also
expanding into Memphis, maybe just the rationale behind those new markets. And is this something we should
expect to see going forward, putting new markets on the map organically?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, I think it's – they're probably a little bit two different stories. San Antonio is a market that [indiscernible]
(00:36:08) for a long time. We have a strong presence in Dallas, Fort Worth and Houston, Central Texas has
been a gap for us. And we've just been looking for kind of the right way to enter that market. We're excited about
the team we've acquired there and we'll have corporate, commercial, treasury, wealth both in San Antonio and
Austin. We'll have a complement of between 15 and 20 folks there in Central Texas. That will be an opportunity
for us to meaningfully expand our presence there. And so, that's going to be full service banking in the beginning
of another key market for us in Texas.
I mean, Memphis really was an opportunistic chance for us to grow our fixed income sales and trading platform
that wasn't necessarily on the radar screen as we began the year. But as things unfolded and opportunities
presented themselves, we really saw it as additive to the current operations we have in Little Rock, Milwaukee
and Stamford, Connecticut. It fits very cleanly. You have very little sales overlap with our existing portfolio and
we're excited for the team that is going to come on board there to help us in that area.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. And just lastly for me, the price of oil is still very strong, but the price of nat gas is depressed. And we
have seen a little bit of noise in that space. But maybe just talk about how you think – I know nat gas. I think it's
only about a third of your energy. But do you expect to see some issues in nat gas over time?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Not at this point. We have like right now, 93% of our gas heavy borrowers are hedged and have over 50% of their
PDP in 2023 and 76% of their PDP hedged at prices in 2024, exceeding $3.50. So, we're – they're well-positioned
to receive price well above what we're seeing in the spot market plus today's market, you can hedge out all the
way into 2025 at almost $4 an MCF. So, we continue to push hedging as a way to protect their portfolio as well as
improve our credit risk. And our customers have been responding. So, we actually are in a really strong position
that we expect our natural gas producers to perform well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2023
Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Good morning Brandon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Yeah. So, I wanted to touch on the outlook as far as loan growth in the prior quarter. You detailed
that economic conditions were very strong. And in this quarter now it's kind of been downgraded to favorable. So,
just want to know if you could provide more context and details around that, what you're seeing in your markets
and with your customers?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, I guess maybe we didn't communicate well, but we certainly don't see unfavorable economic conditions for
loan growth. I mean our footprint markets in the South, Southwest, Midwest are performing exceptionally well. I
mean there's no signs of kind of economic slowdown or early signs of any economic issues. In fact, the long-term
and short-term that footprint of Texas and Colorado and Arizona clearly are high growth markets. Infill from in-
migration from other markets, I think is going to really benefit them long-term. So, we're very bullish and in fact,
we've signaled in our guidance upper single-digit loan growth for the year and we're very confident that we'll be
able to achieve that objective.
I think our year-over-year growth is about 9% and we're in a range to continue that pace. So, we're – we still see
good pipelines. We still see good opportunities. And frankly, the opportunity we have in front of us is a little bit
unique in that others are trying to manage capital ratios or other things like that. So, they're maybe less
aggressive in the marketplace. And so, from a sales perspective, we're endeavoring to be very active in front of
customers and prospects to try to add to our customer and loan deposit and asset under management. But we
want to grow all those areas at a time where we've got lots of capital and great liquidity and we're in business and
we're not having to kind of meter that growth. We'll take all that we can get in this environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Executive Vice President-Regional Banks, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. The only thing I will add is the key here is, that this has been a very broad-based growth. I mean, we have
had all our lines of business experiencing growth, not just concentrated in one particular sector or another. Our
CRE, we are kind of at our upper end of our range of our concentration, but the construction loans have continued
to fund up. So, we're seeing it in C&I, we're seeing healthcare, energy and CRE, all experienced growth. So, we
expect that reflects a lot of things that Stacy was talking about.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2023
Yeah, and Brandon, if you look through to the state level GDP, the state level of employment for our footprint, that
still remains very strong. There's no downturn there at all.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And within that and the tailwind from the competitive environment with these opportunities that you're
getting, are you able to get kind of higher loan spreads or better economics on some of these deals you're getting
today?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
There's no doubt I alluded to that in my prepared comments that we are seeing particularly on the higher end of
the corporate space, deals are pricing upward, whether it's from fewer participants in the market or those
beginning to price for higher capital requirements on the higher end of the banking segment. We are seeing that
25 to 50 basis point increase in loan spreads. I think that will take some time to work through the portfolio effect.
But clearly, that's an opportunity as we move forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then just lastly from me, is there any way you can provide kind of the spot cost of deposits at the end
of the quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, there's not really weighted to do that in particular, new production. If you look at our CD rates that we're
offering, we've got rates in the upper 4s and 5s as new production for, that varies by market, but that's probably
what we've got for you.

Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. Just a few follow-ups here from some previous questions. On the customer hedging
activity, obviously, good quarter in 2Q, it sounds like this is mostly from energy customers. Would love to
appreciate if you think there's some good fall through their potential for the back half of the year?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2023
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think the hedging activity there, I mean, it was a record really in the second quarter, but it's been strong for
us both on the energy side and the interest rate derivative side. Both experienced really strong second quarters. I
think that the shape of the yield curve is going to help on the interest rate derivative side. I mean it's odd that you
can go out and hedge out [ph] three years (00:44:14) at a cheaper rate than the spot rate. But that is the case
today. And so, that's helping a little bit on the interest rate derivative side. And as we talked about with natural gas
future prices, and frankly, oil prices, the market's in a good place to hedge and swap future prices and do it in a
way that's conducive to our customers. So, whether it's the same level as the second quarters, it's hard to
forecast that in a highly volatile segment. But I think that there is good momentum to be able to still have that be a
very strong segment for us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay, appreciate that, Stacy. And then in the press release, there was a mention of the $8.1 million gain from
merchant services. Just remind me what line item this flows through.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, that flows through the other gains and losses kind of right below the fee income.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. I see it. Perfect. And then on the trading securities, Marty, I heard your comment that the end of period
balance could be a better starting point for 3Q than the average. I guess from a balance sheet standpoint, on the
other side of the balance sheet, remind me of how that's typically funded.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, we can use either FHLB or repo either one whatever is cheaper. And so, it's just the short-term
wholesale.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then I guess along with that FHLB and the repo line, other borrowing lines, if you're going to see some
pretty strong loan growth, it sounds like this quarter should we see the FHLB and borrowing line comes down? Is
it a replacement or do you think they'll still be an increase there given the trade securities build that you expect?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Martin E. Grunst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, we'll have good loan growth. We'll have deposit growth that will fund a decent portion of that and then
of whatever the net is from pluses or minuses in the trading portfolio that will really drive the changes in FHLB or
repo.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 26-Jul-2023
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, but Matt it really goes back to kind of reeducating the investor community and kind of how we fund the
bank, loans fund – are funded by deposits. You saw a good loan growth this quarter. You saw good deposit
growth this quarter. Our loan to deposit ratio stayed relatively consistent and we see that as we move forward on
the security side, whether it's the available for sale investment security or the trading portfolio, those are largely
going to be funded wholesale, whether that's repo or institutional or otherwise. And that's entirely consistent with
how we funded the bank. Forever pre-COVID, you're seeing higher levels of FHLB borrowings and things like that
because that's, we got down to none during COVID.
So, as things kind of revert to the mean how we fund the bank is going to look like it did pre-COVID and that it
includes how we think about loans and deposits and how we think about institutional funding or wholesale funding
for our securities portfolio and trading activities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yup. Okay. That's helpful, Stacy. And then just lastly, I guess, I think you mentioned earlier on the call that the
AFS securities yields could continue to climb as you get some, reinvest some of those cash flows. Any more color
on just kind of the roll-off roll-on yields within the AFS book?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, we think about both AFS and held to maturity roll together because both have the same driver. And so,
the roll-off yield is always going to be roughly what the portfolio yield is. I think that was $274 million, if I'm right for
this quarter. And then, current coupon, 15 year MBS or maybe a little bit less than that is kind of a good proxy for
how to think about our repurchase yield on average over time. And so, that gives you well over pretty good spread
200 basis point plus spread pick up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yup. Okay. Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate your help.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
