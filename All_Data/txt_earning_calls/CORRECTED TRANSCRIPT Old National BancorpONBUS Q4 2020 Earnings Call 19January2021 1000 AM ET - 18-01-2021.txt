Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Good morning and Happy New Year. I hope this call finds all of you and your families safe and healthy. We are
really pleased with our fourth quarter and full-year 2020 results. Despite all the challenges that came our way this
last year, we stayed focused on the health and safety of our team members, we successfully executed The ONB
Way transformation, and we remain dedicated to serving our clients and communities.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
We also continued to invest in new talent and further strengthen our client experiences with technology. I'm
pleased to say that we've delivered on the run rate savings we promised from The ONB Way. As a result of The
ONB Way, FTEs and branches are lower by 16% each, and we were able to reduce other overhead cost. We
were also able to achieve better than trend line growth from our commercial segment in 2020 and we plan to
execute additional ideas in 2021 to drive higher revenue.
Starting on slide 3, our 2020 highlights include earnings per share of $1.36. When adjusted for The ONB Way
charges, earnings per share were $1.50. Adjusted return on average tangible common equity was 14.6%,
adjusted operating leverage improved by 460 basis points, and our adjusted efficiency ratio was 55.6%.
We also set several new records during 2020, including the following: Record commercial loan production, record
mortgage production, record capital markets revenue, and obviously, we had strong efficiency and core deposit
growth.
Next on slide 4, our fourth quarter earnings per share was $0.44 per share. Adjusted EPS was $0.46. I was
particularly pleased with our quarterly loan production of $1.2 billion. End-of-period commercial loans, excluding
PPP loans, increased 22% on an annualized basis. The loan growth was split equally between C&I and CRE.
Growing our loan portfolio and improving our earning asset mix will help us preserve net interest income.
End-of-period core deposits increased by 11%, driven by checking and savings account growth. We did have a
small net recovery this quarter, but maintained the overall reserve. We continue [ph] to use (00:03:26) qualitative
factors to offset improvements in the economic data, believing that there's still a fair amount of uncertainty with
the economy and the pandemic.
Net interest income, excluding PPP, increased because of the loan growth and better mix. Noninterest income
was down slightly due to seasonal declines in mortgage, but held up better than previous fourth quarters.
Most of our reported credit quality metrics were relatively benign during the quarter. But as we have previously
stated, we expect the credit metrics could worsen and losses will ultimately materialize after any stimulus and
deferral programs run their course.
We continue to proactively downgrade some of the most pandemic-exposed loans into the watch asset quality
ratings and are still meeting weekly to review credit quality loan-by-loan. We continue to believe that our
historically strong and consistent underwriting practices, our diverse and granular loan portfolios, and our Midwest
footprint should help us weather the impact better than most.
I'm really excited about the team members we've hired during 2020. We continue to have a good pipeline of
opportunities too. We have a great story to tell and we have strong interest from people wanting to join our team.
We have hired and expect to hire more in wealth management, private banking, commercial, treasury
management, and key support team members. As we disclosed last quarter, these hires will cost us
approximately $5 million year-over-year, but should ultimately lead to higher revenue from these growth initiatives.
A quick thought about our capital. We plan to maintain our buyback authorization throughout the year. We will
balance the benefits of buybacks versus M&A opportunities. I suspect there will be M&A opportunities that will
present themselves during the year. We are getting more comfortable that we could put a credit mark on
somebody else's loan portfolio, but we will continue to be an active looker and a selective buyer.
With those remarks, I will now turn the call over to Brendon.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
Brendon Falconer
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Thank you, Jim. Turning to the quarter on slide 5, our GAAP earnings per share was $0.44 and our adjusted
earnings per share was $0.46. Adjusted earnings excludes $3.6 million in ONB Way-related charges.
Moving to slide 6, we are pleased with our full-year adjusted pre-tax pre-provision net revenue, which was 10%
higher year-over-year. And despite the challenging 2020 operating environment, we generated 460 basis points of
positive operating leverage.
Slide 7 shows the trend in outstanding loans and earning asset mix. End-of-period loans decreased slightly
quarter-over-quarter, driven by pay-off of $536 million in PPP loans. Excluding the impact of PPP, end-of-period
Commercial loans increased $473 million, driven by record Commercial production of $1.2 billion. The strong
Commercial growth this quarter was aided by higher-than-average pull-through rates and funding levels. We're
also pleased with our loan growth mix this quarter which is well-balanced between C&I and CRE. Production
yields were slightly lower quarter-over-quarter which was a result of a few larger high-credit quality clients with
relatively low coupons but strong risk-adjusted returns. The $2.1 billion quarter-end pipeline reflects typical
seasonal declines as well as the unusually high pull-through rates of our record third quarter pipeline. We believe
the current pipeline with over $560 million in the accepted category should lead to another good quarter of
production.
The investment portfolio also increased in the quarter as deposit growth outpaced loan growth. We are taking a
disciplined approach of putting asset liquidity to work, including adding some protection if rates were to rise.
Lower rates on new purchases continue to impact our total portfolio yield which is down 14 basis points to 2.31%.
Moving to slide 8, period-end and average deposits increased during the quarter by 9% and 13% respectively.
Growth was largely concentrated on our existing personal checking accounts but we were also continuing to win
new deposit relationships in the business and public segments that added meaningfully to this quarter's growth.
Turning to pricing, our total cost of deposits declined from 13 basis points in the fourth quarter to 9 basis points in
Q4. Both time deposits and borrowing costs were meaningfully lower in the quarter and will continue to fall but at
a moderate pace. Overall, we are pleased with our deposit repricing efforts that have resulted in a significant
reduction in deposit costs while maintaining our core client base.
Next on slide 9, you will see details of our net interest income and margin. Net interest income increased $15
million quarter-over-quarter, largely due to an increase of $14 million in PPP-related interest and fees from the
forgiveness of approximately $500 million in loans. Excluding the impact of PPP, net interest income increased $2
million quarter-over-quarter due to strong Commercial loan growth and active management of our funding costs.
The net interest margin also benefited from PPP fees, adding an additional 31 basis points over prior quarter.
Core margin, excluding accretion and PPP, was 2.88% in the fourth quarter compared to 2.96% in Q3. This 8-
basis-point decline was in-line with our expectations and was partly the result of a lower new business rates I
referenced earlier. However, we also experienced a significant uptick in liquidity, and that while neutral to net
interest income, has put additional pressure on net interest margin. Future PPP payoffs, coupled with stable
deposit balances, could amplify this impact in 2021. Despite these pressures on margin, we expect earning asset
growth to help stabilize net interest income.
Slide 10 shows trends in adjusted noninterest income. Adjusted noninterest income of $58 million in the fourth
quarter was slightly lower than the $60 million we recorded in Q3. The $2 million dollar decline was primarily

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
driven by seasonal factors in our mortgage business. Despite the slight decline, mortgage revenues outperformed
our expectations with a record fourth quarter production of $531 million and a record end-of-year pipeline of $361
million that is more than double the year-end 2019 level. Our capital markets also had another strong quarter,
posting $7 million in revenues; a $2 million increase over prior quarter.
Next, slide 11 shows the trend in adjusted noninterest expenses. Adjusting for ONB Way-related charges and tax
credit amortization, noninterest expense was $129 million. The increase in expenses was largely driven by
incentive accruals that reflects the outstanding 2020 financial performance. Also impacting this quarter's
expenses was the timing of miscellaneous professional fees and community investments. Several smaller items
make up the remainder of the quarter-over-quarter variance and are not expected to recur.
Given the number of moving parts this quarter, we thought it would helpful to provide additional detail on our Q1
expense expectations. Reductions in incentives and other expenses, along with the typical adjustments for
seasonal payroll taxes should result in noninterest expense of approximately $118 million in the first quarter. Merit
increases will go into effect in April and will not impact expenses until Q2.
We also want to provide a brief recap on the top saves we outlined as part of our ONB Way strategic plan. We
have delivered on the $36 million in annualized expense save we promised in 2020, including $26 million in
personnel costs and $6 million in branch and facilities expenses. We are also beginning to see the results of our
revenue initiatives, particularly in the recent above-trend growth in Commercial loans and capital markets
revenues. Additional revenue initiatives in our Wealth and Treasury Management segments are well underway
and we look forward to discussing the results of these projects as they progress.
As I wrap up my comments, here are some key takeaways: We are very pleased with the results of the quarter
and the full-year. Record Commercial loan production led to significant earning asset growth. Our mortgage and
capital market businesses finished a record breaking year with a strong fourth quarter and we delivered on the
promised ONB Way expense savings.
With that, I will turn it over to Daryl to discuss credit.

Chief Credit Executive & Senior Executive Vice President, Old National Bancorp
Thank you, Brendon. First update I would like to provide this morning is likely our last update around the first
round of our client relief programs as they continue to wind down. With respect to deferrals, we have previously
reported that we granted some type of deferral on slightly less than $1.3 billion in loans, which represented
approximately 10% of the portfolio. At the end of this most recent quarter, the dollar amount of loans still in
deferral mode had dropped to $64 million which represents roughly one-half of 1% of the total portfolio. While we
are still receiving deferral requests on the consumer side, we don't feel that they are outsized given the current
environment. Deferral requests on the Commercial side has slowed to a trickle, especially after the
announcement of the new stimulus aid package.
As you know, we were very successful in securing round one PPP funds for our clients, having originated just
short of 10,000 loans with balances in excess of $1.5 billion. As of year-end, we had roughly 6,100 PPP loans
with a balance of $960 million remaining on the books from round one of the program. As of late last week, we
had submitted over 5,800 PPP loans for forgiveness, representing slightly more than $1 billion in balances. Of
those 5,800 submissions, roughly 5,300 of them totaling $636 million have been approved and paid by the SBA.
In addition of the 5,800 forgiveness submissions, 73 of those represented loans greater than $2 million. In total,
we originated only 116 of these higher dollar loans, and it is encouraging to note that we did receive our first

approval for forgiveness for this particular set of loans last week. Remaining fees on PPP loans not yet taken into
income totaled $17 million.
Slide 13 lays out trends in the most significant credit quality indicator categories. Delinquencies fell in the quarter
to 15 basis points of the total portfolio. Decreases in both our C&I and residential mortgage portfolios were noted
in the quarter while we continue to see a somewhat increasing trend in our indirect auto portfolio delinquencies.
With respect to charge-offs, we posted a net recovery in the quarter of 3 basis points resulting in a full-year 2020
charge-off rate of 2 basis points. Non-performing loans increased in the quarter as was expected. Increases in
this category continue to come in great part from the downgrade of relationships that have shown weaknesses
prior to the pandemic. To put it in another way, aside from loans that had reflected weakness prior to the onset of
the pandemic and other than our relatively small hotel exposure, we have not yet seen a meaningful migration of
other credit relationships into our non-performing category. The first round of stimulus payments certainly helped
in this regard and we expect the second round to also provide assistance.
I do want to be clear, though, that we are obviously seeing the migration of credits that were not in a significantly
weakened position coming into the year into the special mention and substandard accruing categories as a result
of the current economic challenges. But this might lead us to summarize that the rate of future inflows of credits
into the non-performing category may likely be highly dependent upon both the ability of the US to roll out
vaccinations in an efficient and timely manner, as well as the length of time it will take US consumers to return to
their pre-pandemic spending routines.
Obviously, the longer it takes to get back to pre-pandemic state, the more room our borrowers will have
experienced financial difficulties. We believe that in the near term, a continuing increase in risk assets is certainly
a possibility.
Slide 14 sets out those industries we have identified as deserving an extra level of attention in this current
economic environment. There has been nominal change in our exposure to these industries, which remains at
roughly 7% of total loans. As we mentioned last quarter, while there is merit in acknowledging that these
industries as a whole may be suffering disproportionately in the current environment, it is important to note that
we will originate new credits in these categories to the right borrowers and for the appropriate purposes.
The chart at the bottom of slide 14 shows the breakout of our consumer portfolio, along with corresponding
average FICO scores. This portfolio has shown little change as well since our last presentation to you. We do
continue to watch our consumer portfolio closely. We will persist in our endeavors to work with borrowers who
have lost their jobs during the pandemic, and we believe that the new round of financial stimulus should help us in
that regard.
As a final comment, I think it is fair to admit that the results which we posted over the last few quarters are not
what we had feared they might be back in March. First of all, our expectations were that we would have seen a
much more significant downward migration of loans into the non-performing category. I think that the combination
of government stimulus programs, cost-cutting efforts by our borrowers, and creative retooling by many of our
clients have been key to keeping more borrowers from financial default.
While the impacts of the pandemic are lasting longer than any of us may have initially anticipated, we're hopeful
that the second round of stimulus will go a long way to bridging our borrowers through to the end of the pandemic.
How and when losses manifest themselves in 2021 remains very uncertain. We expect that loss rates will be

higher in 2021, but the magnitude of those increases, again, has much to do with how quickly we can return to
economic recovery.
Second, the level of 2020 growth has exceeded our marked expectations as well. I think that some of that growth
may have to do with the quality of our loan book going into the recession, which allowed us to not have to solely
focus on the immediate crisis at hand and take a longer view with respect to working with clients, both existing
and new. The sudden nature of this downturn and the likelihood that the recovery will be speedy once the
vaccines have taken hold has permitted us to work with borrowers with an eye on post-recovery prospects.
If we had had to have been more inwardly focused on cleaning up a big share of our book at the outset of the
downturn, I suspect that our success levels in generating new loans would have been much diminished. I believe
that in 2020, we continued to underwrite loans in improved fashion and that we did not take on extraordinary risk
in order to generate the loan growth we have posted.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Brendon.

Brendon Falconer
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Thank you, Daryl. On slide 15, you will see the details of our fourth quarter allowance of $131 million, which was
unchanged from Q3. The improving economic forecast derived from Moody's baseline led to a $19 million
decrease in reserve needs. We added a similar offsetting amount for qualitative reserves that reflects the ongoing
uncertainty of the economy and the charge-off timing. Although the economic outlook continues to improve, we
believe it's prudent to maintain a reserve level until we have more clarity on the path of the virus, vaccination
rollout, and the efficacy of the latest stimulus package.
Excluding PPP balances or allowance, the loan ratio was 102 basis points and is an appropriately conservative
estimate of the credit risk in our portfolio today. We'd also like to remind you that we continue to carry $51 million
in unamortized marks from our acquired portfolios. While these marks will not directly offset charge-offs, any
remaining mark will accrete through margin upon resolution.
Slide 16 includes thoughts on our outlook for 2021. We ended the quarter with a healthy, albeit seasonally lower
$2 billion commercial pipeline, which includes $560 million in the accepted category. Expected core earning asset
growth and reduced funding costs should lead to stable net interest income, but net interest margin could come
under pressure from additional excess liquidity.
The PPP loan forgiveness process continues to go well and we expect runoff and the recognition of the related
$17 million in unamortized fees will be concentrated in the first-half of 2021. We expect our fee businesses to
continue to perform well. We are encouraged by the great momentum in mortgage, evidenced by the strong year-
end pipeline, but performance will still be subject to industry trends.
The strong commercial activity and rate environment should help maintain the high level of performance in our
capital markets business. Deposit service charges continue to lag historical levels and the promise of additional
stimulus could further delay the return of this revenue.
Other fee lines are expected to be stable in the near term, as our ONB Way revenue initiatives in wealth and
treasury management takes shape later in the year. We provided guidance on Q1 expense of $118 million, which
includes the investments in talent we discussed last quarter in our wealth and commercial segments, as well as
some additional marketing and technology spend.

Lastly, a brief update on taxes. As we previously reported, a couple of large historic tax credit projects were
placed in service in Q4. These projects accounted for most of the increase in tax credit amortization in the quarter
with a net income benefit of approximately $1 million.
Regarding 2021, we expect a reduction in the volatility caused by our tax credits as we worked through the last of
the remaining one-year historical tax credit commitments. In total, we are expecting approximately $5 million in
tax credit amortization for the year with a corresponding full-year effective tax rate of approximately 20%.
With that, we are happy to answer any questions that you may have and we do have the full team here including
Jim Sandgren.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Ben Gerlinger with Hovde Group.

Hey. Good morning, guys.

James C. Ryan III A

Good morning, Ben. How are you?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ben T. Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group
I'm doing well. You guys seemed to have a pretty solid 2020, so congratulations on that. I was wondering if you
guys could take a step back and to get a little bit of a bigger picture on The ONB Way. 2020 was largely focused
on expense management and you guys did a lot of heavy lifting throughout the year; and then 2021 was kind of
scheduled to have a lot more of that revenue growth.
Granted when you guys released the plan, a lot of events have taken place since then around the world. So I was
wondering if you guys could just talk around potential timing of when things could come to fruition in terms of
revenue? Any opportunities that you might see now that there has been some disruption in the market that you
guys currently have your footprint in?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
I think those are all good observations, Ben. And many of the Commercial, Treasury and Wealth management
initiatives are just kind of full steam ahead. It's really about putting the right talent in place to go out and execute
those, and there's some technology improvements particularly in our Treasury Management business that we'll
continue to work on throughout the year. And we knew it was going to take the better part of 2021 to really
implement those initiatives, get those people onboard, hired and trained up.

And there are some initiatives around small business and some consumer initiatives that, quite frankly, we're not
quite ready to put in place but we continue to build the technology to support those initiatives, so those are a little
bit longer runway than we anticipated. If we had a more normal economy, we would have anticipated executing
those this year. But having said that, a big bulk of the Treasury Management, Commercial and Wealth is just on
pace and scheduled to happen throughout 2021.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ben T. Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group
Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then my other question, Jim, came to the capital usage. I know that your stocks
have, call it, 45% or so since the lows in like September, October. Obviously, in your prepared remarks, you said
that M&A is much more of an opportunity and like obviously the math does work better with a better currency. So I
was curious on if you had any potential remarks about something going forward? I know your past three
acquisitions have been around $2 billion or so and they've been drifting towards the Northwest, with Wisconsin
and the Minnesota.
I was wondering if you had any other thoughts on any geographies you might be looking into, potential size if it
differs from that $2 billion mark? And then finally if you thought about just the loan portfolio itself of that acquired
bank, is there any concentrations you might want to bulk up or is it a little agnostic to their loan portfolio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
I think we continue to gravitate towards banks that have a similar business mix and model that we have. We
continue to be very comfortable in the Midwest obviously. And in terms of size those Plan A opportunities
continue to be that kind of 10% to 20% of assets. But as we've always said, we're willing to think about other
things if it strikes the right balance between shareholder accretion, strengthening our company further, I think all
those things are going to be important to us.
And I will just say, we're not looking at a book today and get ready to announce a transaction anytime soon. It's
just middle part of last year was pretty hard to imagine that you could put a credit market to somebody else's
balance sheet. We're just getting more comfortable that you can define the scope of what you think the loss
content might be, and probably closing the gap between the bid-ask today than it was maybe six months ago.
So we just think there are going to be opportunities that are going to present themselves throughout the year, and
we're going to be in a position to take advantage of those opportunities and continue to do deals like we've done
in the past that we think makes sense for our shareholders and makes sense to continue further strengthen our
company.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
He's coming into his own. I passed my peak. It's a sad day for me. I'll try to be less disappointing next quarter. I
appreciate you guys taking the question.
I wanted to just get some updated thoughts on loan growth. We backed out the PPP and it's just – I mean it's
extraordinarily strong relative to what we're seeing out of the [ph] EHA (00:25:44) data, a lot of competitors, et
cetera. Just curious, Jim, for your updated thoughts on how much of that is just your customers' organic demand
and how much of it is market share opportunities and where you're seeing most of that come from like
geographically as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
I'll give you my two seconds on it and I'm going to let Jim maybe follow-up on it. A lot of the growth we saw in the
fourth quarter is really all that hard work we've done in the middle part of the year. Again, as Daryl said on his
remarks, and Jim will continue to reiterate, we stayed focused in on calling. And Jim and I went on a lot of client
calls this summer and some of those were opportunities that we're able to steal away from larger organizations
and, quite frankly, made some policy changes that caught up some of their best clients.
And so we walked through those doors and some were long-term clients. And a lot of it was just some existing
opportunities that we had with clients, and then some were new. I mean it was really a mixture of all but I'll let Jim
kind of follow up. But we were really pleased that we really stayed focused throughout the whole year on those
clients. And because I think of our historically strong underwriting practices, we weren't scared that we were going
to have some big mess to deal with. We were able to really stay focused and keep our underwriting going.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Sandgren A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. I think that's well said. I think the commitment through The ONB Way to commit to segments and to really
align our skill sets with what our customers need certainly helped out as well. Really from a production standpoint,
geographically, Minnesota again led the way. We're really pleased with the continued efforts of our Minnesota
RMs, and then continued to see strong growth from Louisville and Indianapolis among others. So again a lot of
the growth was throughout the footprint but kind of concentrated in those two areas.

And while the pipeline is down a little bit seasonally and obviously huge production in the fourth quarter we feel
good about first quarter. I think our accepted category is about $200 million higher than it was at this time last
year, plus we do have a number of Commercial construction advances over $800 million that are still left to be
advanced on. So, I feel like we have some tailwinds but certainly our RMs are committed to growing that pipeline
as we typically do at this time. So, optimistic.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect. Okay. Good. Thank you for that color. And then separately, I know we're still very early in this new round
of PPP program but just curious what kind of demand are you guys seeing for it? What role do you expect you
guys will play et cetera? Just I guess any top-level thoughts, I'd just be curious.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Sandgren A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, Scott. Right now, we're really seeing some nice demand. So we did a soft opening with our portal on
Friday. Already, we've seen over 600 applications. Average loan size is about $150,000. Our RMs are doing a lot
of very proactive outreach to our round one clients who took advantage. We're also doing a lot of focus on
minority-owned, women-owned businesses, nonprofits.
So we anticipate a lot of demand, obviously, a smaller pool. You have to show that 25% reduction in revenues,
quarter 2020 over 2019. That being said, I think we're going to see a lot of opportunities not only to help our
customers, but to bring in some new clients to the bank. So, so far pretty good start.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, Scott, I mean, on average, we expect the loan balances to be relatively small. I mean, it is capped at $3
million. And so, the total impact to our organization will be much smaller than the initial round. But as Jim said in
terms of sheer numbers of loans, I think there'll be a fair amount of numbers of loans. But the dollar size of those
loans will be relatively small and the overall income impact will be much, much smaller in 2021 than it was in
2020.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. All right. Perfect. Thank you guys very much. Appreciate it.

Operator: The next question will come from the line of Chris McGratty with KBW.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Good morning, Chris.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, good morning, everybody. Brendon, maybe just a clarifying question on the net interest income guide. Is that
excluding – can you tell me is that excluding both accretion and the PPP impact or is that one or the other?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, Chris. If you're referencing the 2.88% that I talked about in my opening comments, yes, that excludes both
all PPP-related interest and fees and accretion.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And so the outlook comment that suggested a little bit of pressure on margins, but stable net interest
income, is that kind of the core, core excluding both accretion and PPP?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yes. Absolutely.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And on that, you've got a really low loan/deposit ratio and you've had a lot of success with deposit growth. How do
I think about the borrowings that are on your balance sheet, the need to keep them on the balance sheet this year
and kind of balancing that loan-to-deposit against the loan growth outlook?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Chris, great question. We are looking for opportunities to continue to optimize the funding side of our
balance sheet. There are some leverage we can pull, but I would not expect that number to change materially
over the next several quarters.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Okay. And then, Jim, just going back to your M&A question and comments before. You talked about Plan A
being 10% to 20%. I think in the past you've talked about, pre-pandemic, the willingness to do kind of a

transformational deal or more openness. Does that put in – I guess, play a potential MOE if the stars aligned? Is
that something the board will consider?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Look, we have to do our fiduciary job. If it makes sense for the shareholders and we think we can create long-
term value out of it, we will absolutely consider it. We need to be open to those things, but we know how difficult
they are and they're going to have a higher bar for us, given the execution risk around that. But the board and
management would absolutely consider if it was the right thing to do.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then, just a couple of housekeeping. Could you just provide the remaining one-timers related to
The ONB Way, if there are any? And then the $17 million of PPP fees, is that just the fees, and then we should
add on the 1% coupon or is that all in revenues?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Chris, this is Brendon. Yeah. So, the PPP fees – or the $17 million is just the fees. It does not include the interest
impact for whatever was left in Q1, Q2.
Regarding ONB Way, we are wrapping up with most of the work around ONB Way. There could be some de
minimis amounts coming through in Q1 and Q2, but relatively small at this point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Awesome. Thank you.

James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Good morning, Terry.

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Good morning, everyone. I'm used to coming after Scott, so nothing new on my end this morning, but thanks for
taking my questions.
First off, I just want to make sure I understand the expense commentary. I mean, pretty straightforward, the $118
million for the first quarter. So I guess my question is how much of that $5 million year-over-year increase from
the new hires is in that $118 million? And if it's not all in there, how should we think about growing that number?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
And then same question for kind of the annual merit increase in the second quarter. I think last call, you maybe
quantified that. If you could just remind me the best way to think about that starting in 2Q? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. We talked about a $5 million impact for all the investments. And so, about a quarter of that is represented
in your Q1 number. So, the remainder of that will happen over the course of the year. And in terms of merit, it's
about $1.2 million, $1.5 million per quarter beginning in Q2.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And then, just my follow-up here. If I look at the reserve ratio at the end of the first quarter was, call it, 86 basis
points, now over 1% ex-PPP loans. Once you have a little bit more clarity and certainty about the economic
outlook and just feel more comfortable there, do you think that ratio goes back to where it was, you call it, Day 1
or it was after the first quarter ended?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Terry, I don't think it goes back to Day 1. I think the economic outlook that we'll experience at the end of
this crisis will probably not be as rosy as it was back in January 1 when we put it together. So, my guess is we
ended a level higher than Day 1, but probably not meaningfully lower than we are today.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And then just one last question. I know this came up earlier. Given the acquisition that is occurring in some of
your core markets and in some of the cost-savings numbers that have publicly been talked about, would you be
interested maybe at the end of this year in really ramping up some of your hiring, maybe in excess of what you
were thinking about before that news happened? And if so, maybe what markets do you think present the best
opportunity for that? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yes, We will continue to be an opportunistic place to hire folks for and we have feelers out in all of our markets,
trying to look for the best possible talent. There's still a fair amount of disruption from the largest banks in our
footprint. And sometimes it's difficult to serve your clients and some of those organizations, and so we'll continue
to look for that. And so while we know we've kind of quantified this initial round of hire, really supporting The ONB
Way initiatives, we really continue to be an opportunistic hirer. And I don't expect that hiring would have a material
impact on our overall expense numbers. So we'll continue to look for those great opportunities.
Minnesota continues to [ph] represent (00:35:47) great opportunities for us; Michigan continues to represent great
opportunities for us. Louisville, places like that continue to represent great opportunities. So we're absolutely
willing to go off and hire in excess of our original plans if it makes sense for the long-term growth of the company.

Operator: The next question will come from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Good morning, Jon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Good morning. Good morning. Brendon, maybe a question for you on mortgage banking. You talked about
the pipeline being twice what it was a year ago but what's the message you're sending on some of the near-term
mortgage trends? Can you keep pace with the kinds of numbers you put up in the fourth quarter or do you expect
that to fade a bit?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon Falconer A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, Jon. No real clear message other than to say we ended the year really great. So I think typically we should
be able to outperform the Q1 of last year just given the year-end pipeline. But we'll not be immune to the
headwinds and tailwinds of the mortgage business in aggregate. I think our mortgage business will continue to
follow those industry trends. But I think we'll be off to a good strong start in Q1.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
As I think we're finishing up last year, I mean there's a fair amount of uncertainty, can 2021 be as robust as 2020?
And I think many of the models out there had a really strong 2021 in terms of mortgage fee income where the
MBA forecasts showed maybe down 20% at one point in time. So I think they're just kind of balanced there. I
mean, to be truthful, we're not quite sure what mortgage volumes will look like. We were anticipating a down year
but we've been calling that down year for the last few years to be honest with you. So it's hard to know. We were
just really pleased our fourth quarter ended really strong and hopefully we'll maintain some of the momentum
going into the first quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Okay. Good. Fair enough. And then back on the reserve just to follow-up. The qualitative piece of it, just
curious if you could help us think through that, what are maybe the top couple qualitative factors that maybe you
can't get your arms around that caused that qualitative increase?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2021
I think Jim, Daryl, and I all mentioned it. It's really the path of this virus, the vaccination rollout, and maybe more
importantly the timing of charge-offs and the delayed recognition. And until we have some clarity around that, it's
challenging for us at this point to release reserves in a meaningful way.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And that kind of leads to my last one here to follow-up. You talked a little bit about indirect auto
delinquencies up a little bit and I guess that's maybe understandable with kind of the stimulus pause. But have
you seen any other new problems or anything unexpected? And I understand the qualitative piece of it but
anything new or surprising that you're seeing or is it just generally things are getting better?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl D. Moore A
Chief Credit Executive & Senior Executive Vice President, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Jon, Daryl here. No, there really isn't anything in the portfolio. We've got that slight increase in
delinquencies in indirect. If I had to search and search, the only thing that is remotely surprising to us in our
consumer portfolio is the defaults related to deaths. And I don't think it's COVID-related necessarily but we've
tracked that over the last several years and at least in our portfolio, we have some defaults related to that. But as
we look through the rest of the portfolios, there really is not anything at this point time that's surprising to us, which
may in itself be surprising, right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Right. Okay. Okay. And the general view is that the new stimulus generally helps to push out losses. Do you
think, Daryl, that all the stimulus and what we're seeing and what you're thinking right now that all the stimulus
that we have and is probably yet to come flattens the losses?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daryl D. Moore A
Chief Credit Executive & Senior Executive Vice President, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. I'm maybe in a little different camp. If the vaccinations can't take hold, I think this next round, depending
how big it is could not only just push out losses, it could also serve to reduce, to a certain extent, the loss content
that we have in our portfolio. So I'm a little more bullish on that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Which is pretty rare for Daryl.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
I know. I'm shocked but I'm on your camp, Daryl. I'm in your camp. I think it's positive. So, okay. Thanks for all the
help. I appreciate it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A

James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
Good morning, David.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. As it relates to commercial real estate, curious if you're
– what you're hearing from your customers about how much how much space they will need going forward as we
come out of this pandemic? I'm not talking about the next three to six months, but just over the course of the next
couple of years if you're getting any insights as to customers needing to expand to create space or are they going
to be looking to be cutting space because more people are going to be working at home. Just curious on anything
you're picking up in your discussions with your customers right now?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James A. Sandgren A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. I think it's – David, this is Jim Sandgren. This – I think it's a little early to tell. That whole kind of work-from-
home and office are – we don't have a huge exposure to office and we've been very cautious about that as we go
into it but we continue to keep a close eye on retail. Multifamily, we've had a lot of growth there. I think we're
being very opportunistic, making sure we're doing the right deals, in the right markets, with the right borrowers but
we continue to have those conversations. But I think it's still too early to tell exactly what that trend is going to be
for businesses, and work-from-home, and how much office space you're going to need.
We've also heard the other side. If a lot of people are working from home, people may say, hey, we still need
office space but we may need more office space for less people, so again a lot of things going on right now. We're
just kind of wait-and-see how that all plays out.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan III A
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Old National Bancorp
David, I would just share anecdotal conversations I've had with CEOs across our footprint. And while everybody
was talking about the virtues of working from home last year, I think as the year started closing out, there was a
lot of CEOs that had some fatigue around the work-from-home and the productivity around the work-from-home.
And maybe while it worked really early on, it's been more challenging here as of late. And just the desire for
people who are social by nature to get together and be more collaborative. So I think there's balance in the
conversation today. I agree with Jim. It's too early to tell about what happens to our portfolio. But I don't think at
the virtues that everybody is going to work-from-home and anywhere they want to work maybe in the Midwest
maybe different than maybe other parts of the country. But I don't think that that will mean a big impact to Old
National's portfolio.
