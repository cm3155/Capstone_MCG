Q4 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2021
William Stanton Demchak
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Thanks, Bryan. Good morning, everybody. As you've seen this morning, we had a solid fourth quarter and full
year of 2020 amidst a challenging operating environment. Over the course of the year, we grew loans and
deposits, delivered positive operating leverage and executed well on all of our strategic priorities.
Our balance sheet finished the year in a very strong position, record levels of capital and liquidity and significant
credit reserves. In addition, we grew tangible book value per share 17% year-over-year.
While the economy improved modestly this quarter and we're encouraged by the rollout of the vaccines, we
continue to operate amidst the pandemic a low rate environment and weak loan demand. And before Rob walks
you through the full details of our results, I wanted to share a few high level observations.
First, the investments we've made over the years in talent and technology have allowed us to navigate this
pandemic, the related economic crisis and the widespread social unrest, while supporting our stakeholders and
coming out stronger as a company.
In addition to taking the steps to help keep our employees and customers safe, we provided billions of dollars of
credit to our clients. We granted $14.8 billion in loan modifications and registered more than 70,000 loans worth
approximately $13 billion through the federal government's first round of the Paycheck Protection Program. And
our team is actively working with our clients right now through the second round of PPP.
In response to the widespread social unrest and as part of our efforts to help address systemic racism, we
committed $1 billion to advance social justice and economic empowerment among Black Americans in low and
moderate income communities.
And as you're aware, in the second quarter of 2020, we sold our passive stake – passive equity stake in
BlackRock in November, announced our plan to redeploy those proceeds to acquire BBVA USA.
Since that announcement, we spent a lot of time with BBVA's employees and have become even more excited
about our combination, given their talent in high-growth markets and the similarities in how we serve clients,
manage risk and support our communities. This transaction will create a leading national franchise, significantly
accelerate our growth and enhance our profitability.
And finally, I'd like to close by thanking our employees for their steadfast commitment to our customers through a
very challenging year.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our results, and then we'll take your questions.

Great. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, we've reported fourth quarter net income of
$1.5 billion or $3.26 per diluted common share, resulting in full year 2020 net income from continuing operations
of $3 billion or $6.36 per diluted common share.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2021
Our balance sheet is on slide 4 and is presented on an average basis. During the quarter, lower utilization and
soft loan demand drove a $7 billion or 3% decline in loans. And low rates pressured investment securities, which
declined $5 billion or 5%.
Our cash balances at the Federal Reserve grew to $76 billion in the fourth quarter. Our elevated liquidity position
is a result of continued deposit growth as well as lower loan and securities balances.
On the liability side, deposit balances averaged $359 billion and were up $9 billion or 3% linked quarter. Borrowed
funds decreased $5 billion compared to the third quarter as we used our strong liquidity position to continue to
reduce debt.
Our tangible book value was $97.43 per common share as of December 31, an increase of 2% linked quarter and
17% year-over-year. And as of December 31, 2020, our CET1 ratio was estimated to be 12.1%.
In regard to capital return, our board recently approved a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $1.15 per
share or $500 million. And consistent with the Fed mandate, we had no share repurchases during the fourth
quarter.
Our expectations for share repurchases in 2021 remains the same, as we stated this past December, that is, we'll
refrain from share repurchases, excluding employee benefit-related purchases during the period leading up to our
pending BBVA USA transaction close date, expected to be mid-summer 2021. Following the close, all else being
equal and subject to CCAR 2021, we'd expect to resume share repurchases in the second half of the year.
Slide 5 shows our average loans and deposits in more detail. Average loan balances of $246 billion in the fourth
quarter were down $7.3 billion or 3% compared to the third quarter. This decline included a $5.3 billion decrease
in commercial loan balances, which was broad based, reflecting lower loan utilization and softer loan production,
partially offset by higher multifamily warehouse lending.
In our C&IB segment, utilization rates are currently running at historic lows and approximately 2.5% below pre-
pandemic levels as customers continue to maintain strong liquidity positions, evidenced by high levels of deposit.
Consumer loans declined $2 billion, and balances were lower across all consumer categories. Compared to the
same period a year ago, total average loans grew 3% or $7 billion.
As the slide shows, the yield on our loan balances is 3.35%, a 3 basis point increase compared to the third
quarter, reflecting higher PPP loan forgiveness and a shift in consumer loan mix. And we continue to reduce the
rate paid on our interest-bearing deposits to 8 basis points, a 4 basis point decline linked quarter.
Average deposit balances of $359 billion increased $9 billion or 3% as a result of enhanced liquidity of our
customers as well as seasonal growth. Year-over-year, deposits increased $72 billion or 25% with strong growth
in both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits. As a result, our loan-to-deposit ratio has declined to a
low of 66% at the end of the fourth quarter compared to 83% in the same period in 2019.
As you can see on slide 6, full year 2020 revenue was $16.9 billion, up slightly compared with 2019, driven by
higher fee income. Expenses declined $277 million or 3% and remain well controlled. Our full year provision was
$3.2 billion compared with $773 million in 2019, reflecting the economic effects of the pandemic. Our effective tax
rate from continuing operations was 12.4% for the full year 2020.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2021
Now, let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to slide 7, you can see our total
revenue has grown consistently over the past several years driven by our broad-based business mix. For the
fourth quarter, net interest income of $2.4 billion was down $60 million or 2% from the third quarter, primarily due
to lower loan and security balances and lower securities yields.
Full year 2020 net interest income of $9.9 billion was down slightly by $19 million year-over-year as higher
earning asset balances and lower rates paid on deposits were essentially offset by lower yields on earning assets.
The fourth quarter net interest margin of 2.32% declined 7 basis points linked quarter. Notably, growth in Fed
cash balances represented a 9 basis point decline, which accounts for more than the total linked quarter decrease
to net interest margin.
Both full year and linked quarter net interest margin reflected the impact of substantially higher Fed cash
balances. To size that impact, fourth quarter Fed balances averaged $76 billion, exceeding our LCR requirement
by approximately $55 billion. This level of excess liquidity represented 35 basis points of compression to our
reported fourth quarter NIM.
Fourth quarter non-interest income declined $13 million or 1% compared with the third quarter. Fee income of
$1.5 billion increased $151 million or 11% linked quarter primarily driven by growth in corporate service fees of
$171 million or 36% due to higher merger and acquisition advisory activity. Partially offsetting this growth was a
decline in residential mortgage non-interest income of $38 million, reflecting a negative RMSR valuation
adjustment and lower servicing fees.
Other non-interest income of $293 million decreased $164 million linked quarter. The decline was primarily driven
by a negative $173 million Visa derivative adjustment related to the extension of the expected timing of the
litigation resolution.
Importantly, we continue to execute on our strategies to grow our fee businesses across the franchise, and those
efforts helped to drive record fee income of $5.6 billion in 2020, an increase of $190 million or 4% compared to
2019. This growth was driven by higher corporate service fees, primarily related to increased activity in our
advisory businesses and treasury management as well as stronger residential mortgage non-interest income.
Partially offsetting this growth was a decline in both consumer services and service charges on deposits due to
impact of the pandemic, particularly in the second quarter, as well as our ongoing efforts to simplify products and
reduce transaction fees for our customers.
Other non-interest income declined $109 million year-over-year or 8%, reflecting lower private equity revenue and
elevated 2019 gains on asset sales related to our asset management business, partially offset by higher net
securities gains.
Turning to slide 8, our full year 2020 non-interest expenses were $10.3 billion, a decline of $277 million or 3%
compared with 2019, as we responded to the crises and we managed expenses down.
Taking a look at the fourth quarter, expenses grew by $177 million or 7% linked quarter, primarily driven by an
increase in personnel expense of $111 million due to higher incentive compensation associated with increased
business activity. And in addition, other expenses were up $55 million due to seasonality and equipment
impairments.

Importantly, we generated 3% positive operating leverage in 2020. And as a result, our efficiency ratio for the full
year was 61%, improving from 63% last year. While the current environment presents revenue challenges, we
remain deliberate and disciplined around our expense management. We had a 2020 goal of $300 million in cost
savings through our continuous improvement program, and we successfully completed actions to achieve that
goal. Looking forward to 2021, our annual CIP goal will once again be $300 million.
Slide 9 is an update regarding specific industries we've identified as most likely to be impacted by the effects of
the pandemic. Our outstanding loan balances in the COVID high-impact categories declined in the fourth quarter
to $17.2 billion as of December 31, compared to $18.3 billion at the end of the third quarter, largely driven by
commercial and industrial paydowns.
Within the C&I identified industries, non-performing loans remained relatively low, representing less than 1% of
loans outstanding and charge-offs have not been material. That being said, we do expect to see further stress in
these industries.
The lower half of this slide presents the highly impacted commercial real estate and related loan categories.
These industries are experiencing the most pressure, and downgrades continue to occur. Our two largest charge-
offs in the fourth quarter were related to loans in this category. Overall, now for all of these COVID high-impact
loans, we remain well reserved and continue to carefully monitor and manage these exposures.
Moving to slide 10, this is an update to our customer hardship relief. We continue to see a reduction in the
number of consumers and small businesses requesting hardship assistance. And importantly, loans under
modification that present credit risk to PNC continue to decline.
At the end of the year, we had $900 million of consumer and small business balances in some form of payment
assistance with credit risk to PNC down from $1.7 billion at September 30. On the commercial side, we're also
continuing to selectively grant loan modification based on each individual borrower's situation. Within our C&IB
segment, less than $150 million of loan balances were in deferral as of December 31.
When combining consumer and commercial customers, loans receiving assistance and posing credit risk to PNC
are approximately $1 billion, representing less than 0.5% of total loans outstanding, and as I previously
mentioned, are appropriately reserved.
Our credit metrics are presented on slide 11. Total delinquencies of $1.4 billion at December 31 increased $125
million or 10%. Consumer loan delinquencies increased $72 million, primarily due to government-insured
mortgages that recently exited modification status. And commercial loan delinquencies grew by $53 million.
Non-performing loans increased $201 million or 10% compared to September 30. This growth was almost entirely
driven by a $193 million increase in consumer loans, and within that, $189 million related to residential real estate,
primarily as a result of borrowers exiting forbearance and deferring payments to the end of the term.
Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $229 million, up $74 million from the third quarter. Commercial net
charge-offs increased by $71 million to $109 million driven by specific commercial real estate related borrowers
and included certain portfolio management activity. Consumer net charge-offs were relatively stable at $120
million.
Annualized net charge-offs to total loans in the fourth quarter was 37 basis points, an increase of only 2 basis
points compared to the same period last year. As you can see, the allowance for credit losses to loans was 2.46%

at quarter end, down slightly from 2.58% last quarter. We believe that our reserves sufficiently reflect the life of
loan losses in the current portfolio.
Slide 12 highlights the components of the change in our allowance for credit losses throughout the year. In the
fourth quarter, reserves declined by $495 million. Economic and qualitative factors represented $398 million of the
decline, as improvement in our economic outlook was partially offset by increased reserves within our CRE
portfolio.
Correspondingly, our allowance for loan losses on our total commercial real estate portfolio have increased to
3.06% as of December 31. The remaining $97 million of the decline in reserves was related to portfolio changes,
primarily driven by lower loan balances. Our year-end reserves of $5.9 billion have increased materially year-
over-year and as I mentioned before, now represent 2.46% of loans.
Turning to slide 13, I wanted to spend a few minutes reviewing our recently announced acquisition of BBVA USA
with a focus on update since the call in November. We expect this transaction to add significant value to our
shareholders, and we're excited about the power of the combined franchises. We remain confident in our ability to
achieve the financial objectives we laid out at the time we announced the deal, including the $900 million of
expense saves through enhanced operational efficiencies.
Through time, we do expect to generate additional meaningful revenue synergies, which will make the economics
of the transaction even more compelling. Since the announcement, we've continued to make steady progress
towards completing the transaction. Notably, we've established cross-functional business teams to support the
integration, submitted required regulatory applications and confirmed the mapping of the technology migration.
There's a lot of hard work ahead, but based on our due diligence as well as the progress we've made to date
working alongside the BBVA USA team, we're confident in our ability to execute and deliver on our objectives.
This transaction will significantly accelerate our expansion efforts into attractive growth markets, is financially
compelling, and leverages our technology and acquisition expertise.
In summary, PNC reported a strong fourth quarter and a successful 2020, and we're well positioned for 2021 and
beyond. During 2021, naturally, the biggest variable impact in the economy will be the duration of this pandemic,
and along with that, the efficacy of the government support plans as well as the vaccine distribution. Our current
expectations are for real GDP to return to pre-recession levels by the end of the year and the Fed funds rate to
remain near zero throughout the duration of the year.
Looking ahead at the first quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, we expect total average loans
to be stable to down modestly. Inside of that, PPP loans are expected to be up approximately $2 billion. We
expect NII to be down approximately 1%, which includes the impact of two fewer days in the first quarter.
Excluding the impact of PPP, net interest income is expected to decline approximately 3%. We expect total non-
interest income to be down mid-single digits. Within that, other non-interest income is expected to be between
$275 million and $325 million. We expect total non-interest expense to be down in the mid-single digit range. In
regard to net charge-offs, we expect first quarter levels to be between $200 million and $250 million.
Looking at the full year 2021 guidance, we thought it would be helpful to provide our expectation for PNC's
standalone performance, excluding any one-time costs related to the BBVA USA transaction. For the full year
2021 compared to the full year 2020 results, we expect average loan growth to be down in the low-single digit
range. The significant increase in loan utilization during the beginning of the pandemic elevated average loan

balances in 2020, as you know, which created a difficult backdrop for the full year average loan growth
comparison. However, we do expect to have loan growth throughout 2021, resulting in low-single digit spot growth
for the year.
We expect total revenue to be stable. We expect expenses to be stable. This represents – I'm sorry, back that up.
We expect revenues to be stable, and this represents a current net interest income forecast of down modestly.
But we acknowledge potential deposit growth and further rate steepening in excess of our current forecast, it is
plausible, and that's relative to revenues. We expect our expenses to be stable, and we expect our effective tax
rate to be approximately 17%.
Regarding the pending acquisition of BBVA USA, as I mentioned, we recently filed the required applications and
we're still targeting a midyear close, subject to regulatory approval. BBVA will not be releasing the results until
later this month. Therefore, we will not be providing updates to the previously disclosed financial metrics and
estimates related to BBVA USA at this time.
However, in an effort to provide some context for the transaction in relation to our full year guidance, assuming we
close midyear and excluding integration costs, we expect the acquisition to be approximately $600 million
accretive to PNC's 2021 pre-provision net revenue. And all of that is consistent with our original assumptions.
And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.

I had a question on the outlook here for revenue full year are stable. And obviously, that's without – that's a

guide for NII in 1Q is down. And so if you can talk through what you're doing? And how much of that is loan
growth and – yes? Thanks.

Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Sure. So I'm glad you asked that question because I included that in the forecast in terms of our guidance for the
full year that we expect total revenues to be stable and inside that, our current net interest income forecast is
down modestly. But we do acknowledge potential for deposit growth and further rate steepening in excess of our
current forecast. So there's potential upside there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
And it's offset by higher fees.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
In terms of total revenue. Yeah, in terms of that. That's right. That's right.
In regard to the NII, it's tough. If you take a look in terms of the rate backdrop, we had headwinds all during 2020,
and we expect that to continue through 2021. We will put more money to work on the securities balances. We do
expect loan growth. And there may be some room in terms on the liability side to reduce some of those costs. So
that's how we get to the NII component.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
One of the internal debates that we're having – so the forecast stays as the forecast stays. But one of the internal
debates that there's no winner on is this basic notion that as the Fed continues the size of their balance sheet and
grows it and we have loan growth towards the back end of 2021, that drives deposit growth, right? It's a closed
system.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
And as that happens, PNC benefits disproportionately, at least has and I suspect will, given some constraints on
the largest banks on deposit growth, which in turn gives us NII. So we kind of say, fine, call NII flat, but there's a
macro variable in here that will hit the industry as a function of loan growth and what the Fed does, it's going to
drive this opportunity.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah, I get that. Okay. Maybe you could speak a little bit to the loan growth and where that's going to come from.
That's probably the biggest single debate point that we're having with investors right now. What will drive it to
come back up?

people kind of go back to more normalized behavior. That remains to be seen but I think those are the two biggest

R. Scott Siefers Q

And I feel like you guys just have such a mass of money just sitting at the Fed. So we've had this back up in
higher rates. How much in your mind more attractive is it to potentially invest some of that stuff that's just sort of
sitting there earning virtually nothing at this point?

William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
You would have seen, right that the outright security balances declined just as we got into the low, low rates and
the pre-pays. We have been more aggressively investing money of recent. We'll continue to do that. We have a
lot to go, as you point out. We don't do it all at once. And you should assume that will accelerate into a steepening
curve and moderate into a flattening curve, as you would expect. But we have an awful lot of money to put to
work. And then that, that issue compounds, again, if we get the deposit growth that at least I expect is going to
happen across the industry given the macro factors.

Robert Q. Reilly A

Okay. Perfect. And then the second question, I know it's not necessarily huge for me, but I think a lot of investors
are trying to figure out what is this new round of PPP going to look like? Just sort of qualitatively, how are you
guys thinking about your own participation in it, to the degree that any benefit is baked into the guidance for
2021? How does that end up looking quantitatively as well?

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2021
Sure. I can answer that. So – particularly as it relates to the first quarter, so we will participate in the second wave.
We anticipate that the total balances, because the program is smaller, will be less than the first wave.
But to just give you numbers, we finished 2020 with the average balances under the first PPP program of $12.5
billion. We expect $2 billion of forgiveness in the first quarter, so that first wave would be about $10.5 billion. And
then for the second wave, we expect to originate approximately $4 billion in the first quarter. So that would take
our total PPP in the first quarter to about $14.5 billion. So that's how I size it and that's how I think it. Beyond that,
we'll have to see because the levels of forgiveness and how that goes is fluid.

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2021
Yeah. I think you probably best, Ken, here to look at the 2021 first quarter and give you a number. Of that $14.5
billion that we expect to have in total PPP loans, the NII will be approximately $140 million. And inside that, $30
million – and these are approximate numbers, approximately $30 million represents the forgiveness of that $2
billion that we expect from program one.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Ken Usdin Q

Okay. Great. And the second question is following on your BBVA second half PPNR comments, Rob, just
wondering, is that $600 million also inclusive of the initial saves you're expecting this year? Or is that just like, A,
what they're bringing over kind of on day one? Because I think you did say you were expecting some saves to
happen in the back half.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yes. It's that, Ken. There are some saves in the back half that are included in that number.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q

Q4 2020 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2021
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, guys. Thank you for taking this one. I guess, one of the questions that I've gotten about you guys over the
course of the last couple of months since the BBVA transaction was announced is, just given the somewhat
different credit profiles between legacy PNC and the BBVA franchise, how much of that loan book that you'll carry
over do you anticipate keeping? And will there be some sort of a runoff portfolio that sort of impairs what would
eventually be a higher growth trajectory from that franchise? Or are we going to be sort of steady state and all the
kind of stuff will get rationalized in the upfront mark?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
There's a lot embedded in that question. But there's parts of BBVA's balance sheet that – and it's more sectors.
It's not necessarily quote credit risk but the things we choose to focus on versus what we don't. So, there's parts
of their balance sheet that will run-off over time.
At the same time, because of many of our lending specialties and the presence we'll have in the market, we
expect that we will grow balances in the new franchise. So, you're going to see both. Our base assumptions
assume a run down – I don't know when the trough is, Rob, but a run down in balance sheet...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A

Yeah. Beginning 2022 and 2023.

Mike Mayo Q

Hi. You had positive operating leverage last year. Your efficiency improved. Fourth quarter, it didn't look as good
though. Was there anything that's unusual? And also, your guidance for next year is for flat operating leverage

Thanks.

Robert Q. Reilly A

You want me to answer that.

William Stanton Demchak A

Hit him with the fourth quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Sure. The fourth quarter, most of those expenses that jumped, as you saw, were incentive compensation for
much, much higher activity, particularly in our Harris Williams unit. So, those are good expenses. When Harris
Williams and activity goes up, that's a good thing, but there's obviously expenses associated with that. And then
there are some seasonal things that we expect.
But you're right, for the full year, our expense management was successful. Full positive operating leverage for
the year, which was our objective, and we did that. When you look at 2021, we're going to fight for it. We're not

folding on that. We've got revenues stable and expenses stable. So, it's going to require tight expense
management. But now, we're going to battle for it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And as far BBVA, your loan loss reserve assumptions [ph] might have (00:34:00) improved since you only
had – you had the Pfizer vaccine out. You didn't have Moderna or J&J's. Will the outlook be a little bit better on
the same reasons? You had reserve releases when you have a better outlook for BBVA. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Thank you. Good morning, Bill and Rob. I wanted to follow-up on your comments about investing more of the
securities portfolio into a curve steepening. Some of the dynamics around QE have led agency MBS spreads over
treasuries to turn negative. And you guys along with most other banks have a substantial portion of your
securities...

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
...portfolios invested in agency MBS? So it seems like the benefits of a steeper curve are being tempered
somewhat by those dynamics.
Can you give a little bit of color on where you're seeing the opportunity to invest on the security side? And then
maybe on the lending side, if you could remind us what percentage of the loan portfolio is anchored to the short
versus the long end of the interest rate complex. And just frame how we think about the benefit to PNC of a
steeper curve on the lending side as well.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
You're way too far into the weeds. But you should assume that for now, in terms of where current spreads against
the mix of the portfolio we'd otherwise normally be buying our reinvestment yield is about 80 basis points. How we
get there I'm not going to go into detail.

Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

The other thing that makes us somewhat unique is our entire debt stack is floating as well and you see that in our
liability costs. That's one of the reason our wholesale funding cost has dropped last time I looked, much more
materially than most of our competitors.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Got it. And separately, on expenses, some investors have expressed a little bit of concern that after so many
years of you guys having the benefit of being able to reinvest a strong growth from BlackRock into the business
that the loss of that strong growth is going to make it more challenging to continue to invest at the same pace
without hurting the efficiency ratio. Rob, I heard your CIP target sounds like they're...

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yes. I mean, our investment capability obviously comes from just the firm growing and then recycling expenses,
which we'll continue to do. BlackRock's growth through time in terms of revenue to us was helpful. Of course, as
we go forward here, we're – and assuming we close the – which is good assumption, the BBVA acquisition, we
have a whole new set of expenses in effect to recycle that gives rise to this investment...

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Okay. Yeah. Thanks, Bill. Thanks, guys. That's helpful. If I can squeeze one more in on credit. So, I had a
question on how to about the excess capital as it relates to slide 12. So, in the absence of the BBVA deal, one
could make the case that, that 1.54% reserve rate on day one is the level that we should revert to once we get
past COVID. And so, any level of reserves above that could be viewed as excess. But can you speak to the
reasonableness of that thought process? And then maybe frame for us how to think about the onboarding of
BBVA onto this slide? And what it would mean for your reserve rate and excess capital?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I don't think – I mean, look, our reserve as of today and presumably their reserve as of today is reflective of best
expectations of the forward economy here. So, they'll release their results, and you'll be able to look at that

Robert Q. Reilly A

You had sort of two parts to that question. One was the BBVA USA overlay, and that's to come when their results
come out. The second question just is sort of what is the normal level of reserves under CECL, 1.54% was our
day one after CECL level. Were those normal times? Maybe and if so, that's the normal level.

Gerard Cassidy Q

Can you guys share with us – and I apologize if you've addressed this already. I may have missed it. Obviously,
prior to the BBVA transaction, you guys were growing organically in the commercial footprint around the country.
Is that strategy still underway? Or has that been put on pause as you integrate the BBVA transaction?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
No. No, not on pause, Gerard. So, naturally, in cases where the BBVA USA footprint was where we were going to
go, that's part of that transaction. But everything else holds in terms of opening offices, both consumer and
commercial, throughout the country.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A

ramping up investments in those markets prior to close. So we're not going to wait to close before we think about
the totality of the products and services we want in a particular market. We're going to have it, ideally, the day we
close and then convert.
