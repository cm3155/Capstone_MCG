Hi, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The Firm delivered another strong quarter and a record
first half with year-to-date revenues in excess of $30 billion. We had strong inflows across Wealth and Investment
Management, and in the first six months of the year we added over $250 billion of net new assets across both of
those businesses.
We now have over 13 million unique relationships in Wealth Management. And in Investment Management, our
asset mix is increasingly diverse and well positioned in key secular growth areas such as customization, private
alternatives, and sustainability. Finally, Institutional Securities also had a tremendous performance. Equity

remains the preeminent leader in the industry, fixed income has maintained share gains and our leading
investment banking franchise performed strongly.
Our business is further enhanced by our acquisitions of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance and the progress on our
integrations. Since the respective announcement of each acquisition, both businesses have performed better than
we expected. Not only did the standard merger metrics such as synergies and funding benefits read positive, but
much more importantly, we've seen long-term business growth driven by exceptional client engagement.
This quarter, our ROTCE was 19% and, year-to-date, were over 20%. Obviously, we're exceeding our longer term
targets of 17%-plus. We intend to formally revisit our goals next January. While we will not revisit targets mid-
year, I want to assure you we're as focused on delivering top performance as ever. Though we're always subject
to the broader macro environment, we will strive for continued outperformance.
Now let me talk about the decision we announced two weeks ago on further capital distribution. During the
financial crisis, we reduced our buyback to zero and cut our dividend quarterly to $0.05 per share. Over the past
decade, it has been a slow, steady path of improvement as we grow our dividend from $0.05, ultimately, to $0.35,
and increased our buyback from 0 to $5 billion. I have said for a number of years that Wealth and Investment
Management contributes durable earnings that enable us to pay our shareholders substantially, and that is what
we are doing.
As a result, we reset our dividend, doubling it to $0.70 per share and also increased our buyback up to $12 billion
over the next 12 months. We made this decision because of the confidence we have in our business model and
our performance over the past three Federal Reserve stress tests. These tests confirmed what we've said for
many years. Morgan Stanley has built a significant amount of excess capital and we have the ability to invest in
our business, do acquisitions, maintain a very healthy dividend yield, and increase our buyback.
Given our current earnings momentum, it may take some time to fully distribute our capital, but we feel strongly
that this year is the time to make a big start.
Now, Sharon Yeshaya is here with me today in her new role as Chief Financial Officer. Jon Pruzan, who was
CFO up until midway through the second quarter, is also here with us. And as you know, Jon took on additional
responsibilities as our Chief Operating Officer since June 1. So let me turn over to Sharon, who will discuss the
quarter in detail, and we look forward to all of your questions. Thank you.

Sharon Yeshaya
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Thank you, and good morning. The Firm produced revenues of $14.8 billion in the second quarter, representing
one of the top three quarters on record. Performance continued to be very strong, reflecting high levels of client
activity across our businesses. Excluding integration-related expenses, our EPS was $1.89. Our ROTCE was
19%. Year-to-date revenues of $30.5 billion were a new record, highlighting the power of our Firm, which has
been further enhanced by our recent acquisitions.
Investing for growth remains a priority while also managing our expense base.
On a year-to-date basis, total expenses were $20.6 billion, of which non-compensation expenses were $7.4 billion
and compensation expenses were $13.2 billion. The increase in expenses versus the prior year reflects the
addition of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance and the integration-related costs. Year-to-date, our Firm efficiency ratio
declined to 67%, excluding integration-related expenses, underscoring the operating leverage of our business.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2021
Now, to the businesses. Institutional Securities revenue of over $7 billion demonstrates the power of the
integrated investment bank. Revenues declined by 14% from the exceptionally strong prior year. Higher revenues
in Investment Banking and equities were offset by lower fixed income results. Underwriting was particularly
robust, as issuance remained elevated and, despite lower volatility across asset classes, our sales and trading
clients remained engaged. We ended the period on a strong footing, as clients were active through June.
Investment Banking revenues were $2.4 billion. The 16% increase from the prior year was driven by advisory and
continued strength in equity underwriting. From a geographical perspective, results in Europe and Asia were the
strongest in over a decade. And while technology and health care remain areas of core strength, activity and
financial institutions, financial sponsors, real estate and other sectors supported higher revenues.
Advisory revenues were $664 million, reflecting increased completed M&A activity versus the prior year. Year-to-
date announced industry volumes reached record levels, and clients continued to look for strategic opportunities
as markets remain open and constructive. Equity underwriting revenues of $1.1 billion were the second highest
on record and the third consecutive quarter over $1 billion. The increase from the prior year was driven by
traditional IPOs, where activity remains robust globally. Fixed income underwriting revenues of $640 million were
also the second highest, after a record second quarter of last year. Investment Banking pipelines remained
healthy across products and regions. CEO confidence remains high as companies look for strategic opportunities
for growth.
Equity revenues increased 8% from the prior year to $2.8 billion. We are number one in this business globally.
Revenues were the second highest in over a decade. Results in Asia were particularly strong, reflecting increased
interest in the region from both Asia and non-Asia-based clients. Cash and derivative results were robust, but
declined versus the prior year against the backdrop of lower volatility. Prime brokerage revenues were strong and
increased versus last year, as average balances reached new highs. Fixed income revenues were $1.7 billion.
Revenues declined from the exceptional prior year, as wider bid offer spreads normalized across products.
This quarter's results were broad-based across regions. Micro results were robust compared to historical
averages, but declined from the prior year, as credit markets were relatively range-bound and bid offer spreads
compressed. Macro also declined versus last year with lower revenue in both rates and foreign exchange on the
back of lower volatility. Other revenues of $207 million declined versus the prior year. The decrease primarily
reflects lower mark-to-market gains on corporate loans net of related hedges. Prior-year results benefited from
significant credit spread tightening.
Turning to ISG lending. Our allowance for credit losses in ISG loans and lending commitments was essentially flat
in the second quarter at $1 billion. ISG provisions were $70 million, and net charge-offs were $92 million, primarily
related to one facility. Total ISG loans were flat. The decline in corporate loans was almost entirely offset by
growth in all other lending categories. Lending commitments increased by approximately $6 billion relative to the
prior quarter.
Turning to Wealth Management. The prior quarter will be a more relevant benchmark as a comparison period
rather than the prior year, given the acquisition of E*TRADE. Revenues were a record $6.1 billion. Excluding
integration-related costs of $60 million, EBT was also a record of $1.7 billion with a margin of 27.8%. Growth
drivers of this business remain robust. Net new assets were $71 billion in the quarter, bringing year-to-date NNA
to $176 billion, which represents a 9% annualized growth rate of beginning period assets for the first half. Net new
clients, asset consolidation from existing clients and stock plan retention all contributed to the strong results.
Further, we continued to see strength in net recruiting and retention also contributing to NNA. While NNA will be

lumpy and should be looked at on a full year basis, the first half of this year illustrates the tremendous growth
potential inherent in this business.
Transactional revenues were $1.2 billion. Excluding the impact of DCP, revenues declined 16% from the
exceptional prior quarter. Client activity moderated from the first quarter's torrid pace, but engagement remained
high. Self-directed daily average trades were $1 million in the second quarter, approximately 10% above average
levels for full year 2020. Our client base continues to expand, and our households reached 7.4 million in the self-
directed channel.
Asset Management revenues increased 8% sequentially to $3.4 billion. Year-to-date, these revenues increased
28%. Fee-based flows were $34 billion, bringing year-to-date fee-based flows to $71 billion, almost matching the
amount for the full year of 2020. Fee-based assets are now $1.7 trillion or more than double the level of only five
years ago. Bank lending balances grew by a record $10 billion, and balances reached $115 billion in the second
quarter. Year-to-date, balances have grown by 17%, exceeding our full-year expectation of 10%. This was driven
by strong demand for securities-based lending. Net interest income was $1.3 billion.
Excluding prepayment amortization, which declined approximately $150 million sequentially, NII was up slightly.
The benefit of incremental loan growth was offset by the downward movement in the middle of the curve. We
have realized the fully phased-in synergies that we expected for 2021. For NII going forward, $1.3 billion is a
reasonable exit rate to inform the back half of the year. We expect NII to build from this level, as we anticipate
loans to grow more in line with 2020 levels. The integration of E*TRADE is going well, and we continue to
prioritize the client experience. While early, we are encouraged by continued client engagement and excited
about the potential of our pilot programs around referrals. The workplace channel continues to show momentum,
as we win equity plans, and our number of participants now stands at 5.2 million. Financial wellness plans are
also gaining traction. We had four times as many wins year-over-year.
Moving to Investment Management. Because the timing of the close of the Eaton Vance acquisition makes
comparisons to prior periods difficult, I will review the quarter mainly on an absolute basis. Revenues were $1.7
billion. Total AUM reached $1.5 trillion, and total net flows were over $48 billion. Since we announced the
acquisition at the beginning of October, pro forma net flows were approximately $150 billion. The increased
diversification of this business was a significant driver of results. Total AUM increased 7% from the prior quarter
and stands at a record high, of which long-term AUM reached $1.1 trillion. The benefit of our broadened product
offering and positioning in secular growth areas supported our net flows this quarter.
Inflows across products resulted in over $13 billion of long-term net flows. We saw particular strength in
alternatives and solutions, driven primarily by demand for parametric customized portfolios as well as a $1 billion
strategic multi-asset partnership mandate. We continued to see strong client momentum in our private credit and
core real estate platforms. Loan strategies in fixed income were particularly robust. Asset management and
related fees were $1.4 billion, more than doubling from the prior year, driven by strong AUM growth and the
addition of Eaton Vance. Performance-based income and other revenues were $284 million in the quarter,
reflecting broad-based strength across the private alternatives portfolio. With the integration on pace, our very
strong position in customization, sustainability, alternatives, value-added fixed income and high conviction equity
investing, positioning us all as a critical partner to global clients.
Turning to the balance sheet. [indiscernible] (16:29) assets were essentially flat. Standardized RWAs increased to
$461 billion. Our standardized CET1 ratio was flat to the prior quarter at 16.7% compared to our CET1
requirement including the SCB of 13.2%. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $2.9 billion of
common stock or 34 million shares. Our tax rate for the quarter was 23%.

The second quarter results were strong and balanced. Looking ahead, while we are cognizant of the typical
summer slowdown, we are starting the third quarter from a position of strength, Investment Banking pipelines are
healthy, dialogues are active, and markets are open. Wealth Management continues to retain and attract new
clients, new advisors and new assets. Investment Management should continue to benefit from the increased
diversification of the platform.
With that, we will now open the line to questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with
Evercore. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thanks very much. You piqued my interest. You've made comments around investing for growth remains a
priority. We've seen so much that you've done across Asset and Wealth Management. My question is in ISG.
You're as good as [ph] it gets (18:19) I think in equities and M&A. Where do you see opportunities to invest and/or
capture share across ISG right now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Hey, Glenn. I think, firstly, I wouldn't – I certainly wouldn't – and I'll come back to it in a minute – discount growth
opportunities across IM and Wealth, even though we've just done these huge acquisitions. So I'll come back to
that. In the Institutional business, listen, there's more consolidation going on in prime brokerage. We're the market
leader in that. We will pick up share over time. Clearly in M&A, there's opportunity for us to grow. I think that a lot
of the middle-market M&A space is very fertile. There are different parts of the world where we still think we could
punch above our weight. So I actually think both of those, the equities business as good as it is and the M&A as
good as it is, I actually think there's real upside in both of those.
In the fixed income space, our aspiration years ago was to do $1 billion [ph] a quarter (19:24). We raised it to $1.5
billion. And here we are in a sort of so-so quarter of $1.7 billion. As rates normalize and as the fixed income fee
pool will inevitably grow, I see a lot of [ph] the space (19:43) there. In the SPG credit side, we've got a world-class
business there, again, continuing to grow share. And our commodities business is doing very well.
So the ISG franchise has gone from sort of running at $5 billion a quarter to, this quarter it was $7 billion. It was
frankly better than we'd expected coming into it, which is terrific. But it's very interesting. I mean the share gains
across – and it's not just us, some of the other big players in the US, are real, and I think enduring, and as the
global economies recover and the fee pool increases, you'll just see more of that. So I feel very confident about
the ISG business.

Glenn Schorr Q

a little mark-to-market in terms of what's going on in terms of conversions in the core business and then what is
going on in terms of leading towards retaining business within the Morgan Stanley platform.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Couldn't hear the last part of your question, but I think you said referrals throughout and how the integration on
workplace is going, Glenn.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Yeah.

Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
So I'd say that you're sort of starting with infrastructure, it's going very well, as James said, but the core is start
with infrastructure, make sure that everyone has companion accounts as you go through. So we've said we're at
50% right now, where clients have companion accounts. By the back half of next year, we should be around 90%.
And we've started pilot programs where you do have that companion account and we do see it working. We see
the retention of assets. We see clients moving over to actually get advice when they look and want advice. So
we're working with the clients and we're trying out new technologies, and we'll go from there. So it's really about
conversion of clients and then the retention of assets, but it all seems to be working very well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
I'd just say something, so – off-piste a little bit here because it wasn't in your question, but you've given me an
opportunity to comment based on Shareworks. I think every now and then in business, you look and you sort of
see a wave coming and you catch the wave, and it's a beautiful thing. The whole workplace space to me is the
next major growth area in financial services.
I think over the next 10 years, we'll look back at the Solium transaction which at the time some people thought
was expensive, and it was. I think we spent $800 million or $900 million on it, it might have been Canadian
dollars, so somewhere around there and it was trading at about [ph] $500 million (22:24) value. That gave us the
opportunity to do the E*TRADE transaction with confidence because we knew we could merge the workplace
businesses and create Shareworks. And I really believe that this is very fertile ground and convert those millions
of clients ultimately into being Morgan Stanley and E*TRADE clients as we have the accounts that fold into our
own house accounts. So that's one wave.
Parametrics (sic) [Parametric], the customization space, I think is the second wave. Calvert funds and everything
we've done through our own sustainability [ph] institute (23:05) efforts combined with now Calvert's products. And
then the digitalization on how we're going to take the E*TRADE platform both domestically and internationally, I
think there's incredible opportunity. So it's pretty rare to sit here and having done this for a little while, there are a
lot of things that you can do to just improve your business, but these are things where I think we have
fundamental market forces pushing these waves, and we're right on top of them. So it's very exciting.

Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, and I'd like to just start by saying congrats to Sharon. Welcome to
the calls in a different role, the quarterly dance here. Congrats.

Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Sure. So I'd like to maybe start with the integrations and sort of taking a step back. You've got two pretty
substantial deals under your belt. They've now closed and so you're working on integrating those businesses.
What are the milestones that we should think about as you proceed with that work? What kind of timeframe
should we think about around updates? Are we going to just get back to the annual strategic update where it's the
fourth quarter call, or are they going to be more regular updates where we're going to be able to hear about the
work that you're doing? James, you made reference to the workplace, which is obviously a key part of E*TRADE,
but how should we think about those from here? I know it's kind of a broad question, but just want to try and level
set.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Sure, I think that it's a fair question. And in terms of where that comes out, it will likely be the next step will be the
annual deck. But then from that point on, I think there'll be a more regular cadence. So, obviously, most investors
here know Jed Finn, for example, who can begin to take us through some of that workplace, but there's also – I
think the goal will eventually be to better understand where there are participant migrations. So how do you think
about the question that Glenn asked which is referrals? How do you see that referral channel going through in
terms of dollars, et cetera? How are you thinking about proceeds and the proceeds falling through from those
companion accounts? But the integration is a three-year process, which we put out there at the very beginning.
So I think right now what we're looking to do is make sure that the pilot programs are going well and understand
the client reaction as you think about some of the technology and what is working and what isn't working. So to
give you things piecemeal or to give it a little bit too early I think would also be a mistake because we'd like to
ensure that it is the right client experience, and that's what we're focused on right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks for that. And then when we think about net new assets, the growth there has been really pretty
impressive. We have seen some acceleration across the industry though, and I think most investors think it's
going to slow. This past year has been a little unusual. But when we look at what's been happening at Morgan
Stanley, things already were accelerating before we entered into this period. And so one of the debates that has
been coming up more regularly has been what is the right growth rate for the Wealth business on a go-forward
basis. I'll maybe throw out a range. And from my perspective, it feels like somewhere in the mid- to upper-single
digits, 5% to 7% feels fair on a long-run basis. But number one, I'd love to hear your reaction to that. And then
number two, how do you think about that growth rate? Do you guys have something in mind? Is there something
that you're targeting? Any color on that would be really helpful.

James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
I want Sharon start and I've got a few thoughts about this.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. I mean I think where we started, Brennan, if we look back to the beginning of the year, we gave you guys a
very long historical average chart and then we showed you the 7% of the pro forma when you included E*TRADE.
Now, what we have said is we don't think we'd go back to a 3% to 4% sort of on a sustainable basis, so that 5% to
6% is where James spoke to this audience at the beginning of the year when we talked about the deck.
Obviously, as you look forward, though, we're doing a lot both on net asset consolidation, net recruiting, and all of
these new channels. And so I don't think the same way that James level set with the targets at the beginning of
his introductory remarks, I'd say we don't – that's probably the same way you can think about this where 5% to
6% maybe that's the right place to start, but we're obviously not going to try to underachieve that number.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yeah, Brennan, it's really the – it's the the question, right, because if we can generate growth in the high-teens – I
mean, I think, what are we 9% year-to-date organic? I mean this is just – we've never seen this, right, and I've
been doing this for a very long time. The three industry segments basically, the wire houses, sort of
independent/RIAs and the direct channel, for years the direct has grown, the RIAs have grown in large part
because they've taken – advisors have moved out of the traditional channel into the RIA channel. So part of the
growth has just been a shift, if you will. Part of it's been organic, and the wire houses have sort of struggled, and
they've struggled for a couple of reasons. One is poor training. Two is very high attrition. Three is lack of luring the
clients in through the mortgage and the banking products that the banks have, et cetera.
And I think what you're seeing now, we think we're kind of creating, not to be arrogant about it, but a new
mousetrap. We're creating an advisor channel which actually has deep organic growth flavors in it, and if you look
at our attrition numbers and the weekly hiring numbers, I mean they're fantastic. And with that, we're getting
tremendous asset growth. And then you combine that with having the direct platform and then combine that with
having the workplace platform. You've got three legitimate channels pouring assets into the house. And it wasn't
so long ago that if we did $10 billion a quarter, we thought we were pretty good. And we just had a $70 billion
quarter during tax season, and it's good. I mean it's very good, but we don't think it was a fluke, so I don't know
where the ultimate number is going to settle.
I think our assets in Wealth are now around a little over $4.5 trillion. They were at $500 billion 12, 14 years ago,
so we're at $4.5 trillion, we've gone up nine times. Compounding on a big number is a pretty potent force, as you
know, so I don't know if it's going to – it won't be below 5%. And in any individual quarter you have stuff going on,
but it won't be below 5%. Whether it's 6%, 7%, 8%, where we land on that, we'll see over a few years, but it feels
good.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2021
Hi, good morning, and welcome, Sharon. Nice to have you on the call. Wanted to start off with just a two-parter on
Wealth Management and NII. You noted that the E*TRADE funding synergies have been captured for 2021. The
deposit cost in Wealth Management still feels a bit elevated at 16 bps especially when benchmarking versus
peers. Just wondering if there's potential to drive those funding costs lower if rates remain at zero. And then just
as a second part, maybe just speak to the environmental factors supporting such strong SBL growth and the
sustainability of that trend.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Sure, I would just mention that we did see the planned run-off, right, of wholesale deposits and we continue to
expect another $13 billion of wholesale deposits to run off by year-end, as we see some of that higher-cost
funding roll down. So just to note there. I don't have an exact target on sort of BDP costs, but that will give you a
sense. In addition to that, I would just highlight the SBL question that you asked. That product is resonating with
our clients, so that's the point there. And as James has always said, it's a product in which you lend wealthy
clients their money back. And this is something that is resonating. It's structured very well. We've historically seen
minimal losses, and it has a 37% LTV right now in that portfolio. So, from that perspective, I think, it's a good
product to offer and it's also something that works, especially in a season like this, where you generally see a lot
of that product in tax season and so there is an elevated number in the second quarter generally speaking.

Got it. And just for my follow-up on capital management. The dividend increase that we saw was much higher
than anticipated. It looks like you're now running with the highest dividend yield amongst all of the G-SIBs. I know,
James, you had alluded to the improved stress test outcomes, the higher contribution from recurring revenues.
But just remind us of the philosophy around setting the dividend and buyback and where you're running on your
cap – where you're comfortable running on your capital ratios on a through-the-cycle basis.

So let's just start with – I think we're a company that is going to produce durable revenues forever unless we go
and screw it up, basically. If you look at the daily numbers coming out of the fee-based businesses and the
Wealth business, and the fee-based businesses and Asset Management, they're for real and they're every day,
and they're not $10 million, they're $100 million. So you've kind of locked in a $25 billion business right from day
one in the beginning of the year. And our view on that is, unless we spend our way into trouble on it, it would
generate very consistent earnings. And just philosophically, it doesn't mean I'm right, but my view was certainly
the Wealth business and the fee-based part of the Asset Management business which is so predictable, we think
of it as like as a yield stock. And the Investment Banking and Trading businesses and Capital Markets businesses

and some of the Carry businesses and Asset Management we think is like not that the other business isn't a
growth stock, but that provides the capital to fund the engine to do buybacks, et cetera, et cetera.
We've been carrying a buffer of CET1 of over 17%. We have to be – I think the latest CCAR was around 13.2%-
ish. I don't know what the exact buffer we should carry internally is. We've said 50 basis points. It wouldn't be less
than that. But just pretend it's 80 basis points. You're at 14%. You've got 300-plus basis points to play with. We're
generating net income in the first half of this year. It was $7 billion. Assume we're less than that in the second half
just because who knows. But we're certainly not going to be under $10 billion for the year and probably not under
$12 billion, so you're talking about a buyback of $12 billion, a dividend of $5 billion that gets you to $17 billion.
You're generating at least $12 billion. You're in the hole for $5 billion, but you've got 300 basis points of excess.
It's going to take a bunch of years to eat into that. And we felt our shareholders deserve to get the earnings
stream up, the predictability of the businesses that we've got.
We're not a traditional investment bank as traditional investment banks used to be, and the vast majority of them,
if not all of them, went out of business or merged. We are a combined investment bank with a massive Wealth
and Asset Management business. So we think shareholders should get the benefit of that very different profile.
$14-point-whatever-it-was-8 billion in revenue this quarter, a little over $7 billion of it was institutional, a little over
$7 billion of it was Wealth and Asset Management. So it's exactly what we hoped, this sort of balance. That's the
philosophy.
Now, it would take us a bunch of years unless CCAR changes dramatically, for us to get close to our buffer, and
we're buying the stock back and the stock's over $90. We're very happy buying at this level, but at some point
obviously that gets expensive. We do think we can do more deals over time, and we'll actively look at that. And
we want to keep investing in the business. But the reality is – and this is like the ultimate conundrum – we can do
all four – buy back, dividend, invest in acquisitions, and still run an excess buffer. And the only way out of that
problem is not to have good earnings, and that's not my solution currently. So let's play this out over a few years.
I'm really happy we got the dividend as we called it a reset, and we have the authorization from the board for up to
$12 billion. And we'll go hard at that particularly if we saw a big move in the market, but that's how I'm thinking
about it and how the board is thinking about it.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is
now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. This is actually Bernie Von Gizycki on for Matt. So my questions are on Investment
Management and the inclusion of Eaton Vance. In last quarter's 10-Q, you noted that certain Eaton Vance
products have lower average fee rates than the standalone Morgan Stanley Investment Management platform. I
know you made some revisions to the AUM disclosures and Eaton Vance only had one month of performance in
the data in 1Q. Could you just talk about the expectations on fee rate in the combined Asset Management
platform as you diversify the product mix?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yeah, I think that that's right. Obviously, that's in some of the overlay products, for example, we'll have lower fee
rates. It will obviously be a mixed product. Also if you think about it just across the platform, you might see other
gives and takes. But I think that what we're focused on is not necessarily the fee rate of one individual product, it's
11

creating an ability to service the client more broadly. So while the overall fee rate might come down, as was
disclosed, there are secular growth trends that should continue to bring assets to the platform, which would offset
parts of that on a total basis, right, a rate times volume kind of concept.
In particular, you have the Parametric product which we discussed, which is obviously – has its own secular
growth trends, the Calvert product. And then there are cyclical trends that could eventually turn into secular
trends, i.e., ESG, i.e., what's going on with changes to tax legislation and how people think about customized
portfolios. All of those things are reasons that we might see changes in growth in AUM.
And in addition to that, I think that the fixed income products offered the clients an ability to bring their entire
portfolio to Morgan Stanley. And so from that perspective, again, rate times volume over time, and so there will be
a difference in those fees more broadly on the portfolio, but [ph] assets (39:38) should continue to come in.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay, thank you. That's helpful. And then just my follow-up, again, I know it's just the first full quarter of Eaton
Vance just combined on the platform, but just any color you can share about the integration efforts around like
putting Eaton Vance's products on your international distribution channel and then vice versa, putting some of
your core products on Eaton Vance's domestic retail platform, just trying to get a sense of anything with the net
flows showed up. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
I'd say we've aligned the sales forces, but as you noted, it has not been that long. We're working through it. I think
we see and we expect to invest in the various businesses to deliver the customization for a better client
experience, but also open the new workplaces, so not just international, but also as it relates to workplace, et
cetera. So we're still working through that and we should have an update over the course of the rest of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
But the short answer on the flows is zero of the flows, to my knowledge, are a result of exactly what you just said,
putting the Eaton Vance product in international and putting our product through the wholesalers in Eaton Vance.
They're terrific teams. There'll be a lot of upside on that going forward, but zero of it has appeared yet.

Christian Bolu Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Good morning, James and Sharon. And just echo the sentiments, a big congrats to you, Sharon. James, maybe
actually a couple follow-ups on things you've said on prior questions. I think you just said – maybe a couple
questions before – that you mentioned you can do more M&A deals. Just trying to get a sense of what you're
thinking there. Is that doubling down on Wealth Management or is it consolidating traditional Asset Management
space as you look to grow to $10 trillion in client assets.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2021
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yeah, Christian, good morning. We've done, I think, five deals, acquisitions since the crisis, and we've had a lot of
dispositions – disposals I guess. TransMontaigne, [indiscernible] (41:43). We spun off MSCI. Obviously before
this, we spun off Discover, PDT [ph] to set our (42:03) business. FrontPoint we shut. So folks have focused on the
acquisition side, but we've also done a huge number of deals in getting rid of businesses that are better owned by
somebody else or just weren't a fit. Now, [ph] Azores (42:21) in Spain, I remember, Quilter in the UK, European
private banking business we sold, et cetera. So on the deal side, we've done – Smith Barney, obviously, was the
big one, and Mesa West was the first sort of toe in the water in Investment Management, then the Solium deal in
the workplace space, followed by E*TRADE and Eaton Vance.
So all I'm saying is we don't have big transactions in line of sight at this point of time, but we're a big enough
company. We're generating, I don't know, we're running – run rate, I guess, is $60 billion in revenues this year,
$170-plus billion market cap. Finding the right things to fit in, particularly internationally and particularly on the
digital and technology side, is very interesting to us. Now, pricing as always, you've got to be disciplined, but it's
just – it's something that we're very watchful of. And we're not shy about it. But major transactions are highly
unlikely to happen. These are more bolt-ons as they feel right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christian Bolu Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Great. Thanks and just a follow-up. You keep mentioning international. I think you said E*TRADE you want to
expand that international, which I don't think I've heard before. And if I remember correctly in the past, you were
always cautious about Wealth Management international expansion. I mean you just said you divested Quilter
and E*TRADE [ph] closed its (43:34) international business [ph] post (43:48) financial crisis. So just can you just
talk more about how you think about international, how you would expand E*TRADE, what's the sort of like vision
here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Sure, I'll try and be brief. The international Wealth business is complicated because while the US market is 300
million people and Europe is about 300 million people, Europe is multiple jurisdictions within that, even though it's
the Eurozone. Asia people look at as though it's some monolith. It's not, Vietnam is not Indonesia. Malaysia is not
Thailand. The Philippines is not Australia. Korea is not China, et cetera, et cetera. So it's very hard to get scale in
these markets. That's issue number one.
Issue number two, they tend to be very heavy equities trading markets. They're not the diversified traditional
financial planning market. Look at Japan, the velocity of asset in Japan compared to the US, it's night and day.
And thirdly, obviously, know your client. Money laundering, all of the things that one has to be careful about,
cross-border-type money flows, the bar is very high. And we're a conservative institution, we just are. So my view
has been for a long time that you trade very carefully. You go where you've got scale. We've done that in LatAm
because we've basically run it out of Miami and New York, so we run it as a region as distinct from single
countries and you go and we've done it in Hong Kong where we deal with a lot of wealthy Asian clients out of
Hong Kong and Singapore, a little bit in Australia. But basically, you go where you have scale. So the more
attractive path forward is likely to be through digital and electronic under the brand and with good products rather
than trying to build up thousands of people in, I don't know, Malaysia and Indonesia. Hence E*TRADE becomes a
very interesting platform for that. Early days, that's the – the new strategy team is taking a look at what we can do
internationally, but that's something I'd be very excited about.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your
line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi, this is the first call since you announced the partnership with Microsoft to accelerate your cloud development.
Can you talk about what you hope to achieve with that, with any concrete metrics possible? And ultimately how
much do you expect to have of your processing on the public cloud or the private cloud and otherwise on-
premise?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yeah, I don't think I have off the top of my head all of those details, Mike. We do have a major deal with Microsoft,
but we're also working with other cloud providers. I won't name them on the call, but we have a long-term contract
we've just done with Microsoft. It's all part of the reimagination of our technology organization, and it's come
through some programs that we've put in place internally, around Agile and something we call Pace that are
basically designed to move this organization into this century which I think they've done a fantastic job of. We've
created a group of what we call the distinguished engineers. And interestingly and people don't think of it this way,
but I think we've done the biggest move in technology of any of the large banks maybe in the world, by spending
$13 billion on a technology company called E*TRADE, which is basically technology and brand. So the Microsoft
deal is a very important one, but it's not the whole enchilada for what we're doing with our tech platform. It's just a
necessary step to move a large part of our business into the cloud, and we've got, I think, three different
providers. We just have had the largest contract went to Microsoft on this occasion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then a separate question on culture. I think it was like six or seven years ago, you made some pretty
harsh comments on compensation and people had to take stock and they were all upset and I guess that was the
right move for you and for them. And recently, you made some other tough comments as relates to employees
needing to be back in the office. And there's a big debate out there. Should you have a hybrid solution? Should
people be back in the office? If you work outside the office, should you be paid less? So I preface my question
saying, well, you were right whenever that was six or seven years ago about taking a hard stance short term for
the long term. Can you elaborate on those comments you made recently?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Well, they're certainly not connected and I think it was nine years ago. I think it was 2012. We were barely
profitable, and we cut the dividend to $0.05. We had zero buyback and we had an ROE of about 2%. And
somebody asked me in TV interview how would I feel about people complaining about their bonuses, and I said
what I said at the time. If you don't reward your shareholders at some point, as you remind us over the years,
Mike, when our ROE was well below 10%, they pick up their bat and ball and go home. So given we're paying
employees a lot in stock, it was in their self-interest to hang tough, get a lot of stock very cheap and they'd be
rewarded. And I'm very, very happy for our employees that that's in fact what's transpired and the stock has gone
from obviously a very low number to where we are today.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2021
The comment I made about the workplace, I fundamentally believe that the way you and I and others sitting in this
room, Sharon and Jon, have developed our careers is by being mentored by and watching and experiencing the
professional skills of those who come before us. It's certainly dramatically affected my career and I don't think you
can do that sitting at home by yourself. I think there's a limit to how far – as good as the Zoom technology is, how
far that can take you. So what I said was that I wanted people to start coming back in the office and certainly by
Labor Day. But I also said, which wasn't picked up in the media, that we would be flexible where flexibility was
called for.
What we've learned through COVID is that under certain circumstances, having people work from home makes
great sense. There are individuals who have health issues. There are individuals who are looking after family
members. In past years, we would have said, well, that's sort of too bad. Now, if you have to move to be with your
family for a couple months to look after a health issue or a family issue, we can manage that. Some people have
extraordinary commutes. We can manage some flexibility around that, but the basic premise – and right at the
beginning of COVID, in February of, what was it, 2020, I think I said when I was asked how would this end up, I
think I said that I felt 80% of all employee hours worked would be done in one of our offices, and that's probably
where it's going to end up. Not 100%, but not 0%.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning. I just had a question around – I know you mentioned earlier in terms of updating the Street around
your 17% plus return outlook early next year. I was wondering if you can talk about, as you think about the next
five years and just the competitive forces, talk to us how you're thinking about budgeting some investment spend
as it relates to R&D or more experimental-type investments that could allow you to better compete and gain
market share.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
That would take a lot longer than we probably have on this call. Why don't we hold that until we get to the strategy
discussion next year because I much rather tie budgeting and investment discussions to actual initiatives we're
undertaking rather than just do it in the abstract here if you don't mind.

Good morning, Sharon and James. Can you guys share with us, you talked about wallet share gains in the ISG
group, and I was wondering if you could elaborate on how you think you're achieving as some of your peers have
said the same thing. Is it because of your people or the amount you've invested in technology, your size? Or is it
some of your competitors are just weaker and have other issues to deal with which gives you this opening to take
wallet share gains?

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2021
Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Hi, Gerard, it's nice to hear from you. I'd say it's all of the above. But more importantly, I also think that there is
something that we've said which is in periods of crisis, which I think you saw over the course of 2020. Oftentimes,
those that you are closest to, from a relationship perspective, end up being your closest relationship and you're
gaining share in that regard. So very similar to what we've talked a lot about on this call about asset consolidation
in a Wealth Management relationship. I think the same goes for the relationship consolidation if you think about
Institutional Securities. So be that on the equity underwriting, for example. Be that in coming to the equity
business, but not forgetting what we've done in fixed income which has really gained share since 2015, to be a
really credible player in that marketplace. So all of those things. I think technology and leveraging technology with
the beginning of MSET in equities moving over to the right places in fixed income where it makes sense, that
investment continues. And I think it's helped us gain share as well, from, like you said, probably the Europeans
and others that have retreated in certain marketplaces.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sigee with BNP Paribas. Your line is
now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeremy Sigee Q
Analyst, Exane BNP Paribas
Thank you. Just really a quick follow-up on net interest income in Wealth Management. I just wondered whether
any of you were sort of at a sustainable base level here and NII should now grow in line with the volumes that are
coming through or are there any further moving parts that you expect to affect that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Well, I would say that the fundamental moving part is rates, right? So if you think about it, obviously there are
certain things where when we look at giving you guidance or presenting a base case, the base case is what's
priced into the marketplace. And so we use that as the guide, and that's why I think for this quarter, what we
mentioned was the medium part of the curve did move more than I think most had expected or predicted. But as
you go forward, right now, at least for 2020, the build is really going to come from the actual lending, which we've
talked about, which is a 2020 number is what we've just given you, and we said that that ran around $18 billion for
that year. So that's $4 billion to $5 billion a quarter that you can think of for the growth in lending per quarter
through the end of the year.

Daniel T. Fannon Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning. So I had a couple of questions just on the Investment Management and Eaton Vance. So,
curious, I know you mentioned that you're just integrating the sales forces for the distribution platforms, but
curious about which products you think have the most potential to be sold through the Morgan Stanley distribution
on the global side as you look at the Eaton Vance product lineup today. And then within ESG, you have multiple
capabilities now with Calvert and what was legacy Morgan Stanley. How do you think about integrating that more
broadly across the Investment Management segment given the demand you're seeing, we're seeing across the
industry for those types of products?

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 15-Jul-2021
Sharon Yeshaya A
Chief Financial Officer, Morgan Stanley
Sure. So I would say sort of similar to my last answer which is all of the above, I think all products, but particularly
we've talked a lot about the customization of parametric. I don't think that's just Wealth Management. I think that's
a workplace product as well over time, so not just an advisor-led product. Alternatives, private credit is one where
I think we've seen an interest, and we continue to see interest in alternatives from the Wealth Management
franchises more broadly, not just our own. And as you think about ESG, we had always talked about Eaton Vance
and the old MSIM being a "perfect fit" in terms of the two. And I think a lot of that came from the distribution and
the complementary distribution that you had. So ESG products and Calvert was an Eaton Vance product with a
US domestic sales force. We have a strong international sales force, and obviously, a lot of the interest in the
ESG and sustainability products are also coming from Europe and abroad, and so that's where we think that that
distribution can really help thinking about taking those products elsewhere.
