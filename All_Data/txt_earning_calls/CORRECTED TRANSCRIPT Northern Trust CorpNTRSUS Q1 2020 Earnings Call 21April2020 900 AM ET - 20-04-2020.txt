Thank you, Mark. Let me join Mark in welcoming you to our first quarter 2020 earnings call. Amidst this crisis, I
hope you and your families are healthy and well. I also want to acknowledge and thank all the healthcare workers,
other first responders and the entire community of essential workers for their heroic efforts during this pandemic.
Inside Northern Trust, we often speak of our four key stakeholders clients, employees, community and
shareholders. I know we'll devote a lot of this call to discussing the impact of the crisis on shareholders but I'd like
to take a moment to describe our actions and how they relate to the other stakeholders. We've been engaging
with our clients more than ever. Despite the pandemic markets have remained open and our clients have needed
to make investment decisions and complete important transactions. Turbulent times such as these show the
importance of a strong capital base and liquidity profile as well as robust technology and resiliency plans. We've
been able to provide support to our clients and the exceptional service they have come to expect from us.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
We saw global transaction volumes increase 70% in March compared to February and 60% compared to one
year ago. We were able to utilize our global operating model to transfer work around the globe to manage peak
volumes. During the first quarter, in support of our clients, we saw deposit growth of over $22 billion and funded
loan balances increased by over $6 billion. In a short amount of time, our team also created a solution to provide
access to the Paycheck Protection Program and we began processing applications. Whether it's through video-
conferencing or phone calls and into boardrooms or living rooms, our clients want the advice and counsel of
Northern Trust.
The vast majority of our employees, who we call partners, made a significant shift to working away from our
offices with over 90% regularly working remotely. For the critical functions that require a small number of our staff
to be in our offices, we are taking extra measures to ensure their safety throughout the duration of the crisis.
For certain eligible partners, we are providing supplemental compensation to support them and their families
during this difficult time. We are also offering increased flexibility for alternative work options due to mandated
school closures and other impacts of the pandemic. The commitment, expertise and professionalism of our staff
has been extraordinary. So I'm pleased we've been able to provide this support.
Northern Trust's businesses and therefore the communities we reach are truly global with over 20,000 partners
across North America, EMEA and APAC. We announced philanthropic support to several nonprofit organizations
around the world and created a COVID-19 Matching Gift program to support the efforts of our partners. Our
guiding principles of service, expertise and integrity have guided our actions over the last several weeks and we'll
continue to focus our efforts as we navigate the difficult environment we all face.
Northern Trust has endured crises before and we are extremely confident in the resiliency of our business and our
staff. My sincere appreciation to everyone working so hard throughout this crisis and our sympathies to everyone
impacted by this disease.
Our annual meeting is taking place later this morning. So I have another opportunity to speak to our performance
and strategy. But for now, I'll turn the call to Jason to review our results for the quarter and discuss the financial
implications of this pandemic.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Well, thank you Mike. Before I start, I want to take a brief moment to recognize all those affected by this crisis,
especially those working on the frontline. Our thoughts are with you and we hope you and your loved ones remain
safe and healthy.
I'd also like to express my sincere gratitude to all Northern Trust partners for their continuing hard work, resiliency
and flexibility in these uncertain times. I'm extremely proud to be part of this team that achieves grater for all of
our stakeholders, no matter the adversity.
Now let's delve into the financial results for the quarter, starting on page 3. This morning we reported first quarter
net income of $360.6 million, earnings per share were $1.55 and our return on common equity was 13.4%. You
can see on the bottom of page 3, the macroeconomic environment became more challenging during the first
quarter, however, recall that a significant portion of our trust fees are based on quarter lag or month lag asset
levels and thus the current quarter's fees do not fully reflect the impact of the decline in equity markets during the
quarter.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
Let's move to page 4 and review the financial highlights of the first quarter. Year-over-year, revenue on an FTE
basis increased 7% with noninterest income up 11% and net interest income down 3%. Expenses increased 4%.
The provision for credit losses was $61 million in the quarter while net income was up 4%. In a sequential
comparison revenue increased 2% with noninterest income up 5% and net interest income down 3%.
Expenses decreased 1% while net income declined 3%. The provision for credit losses of $61 million during the
quarter was primarily due to an increase in the reserve driven by current and projected economic conditions
resulting from the ongoing pandemic and the related market and economic impacts, the largest increase in the
commercial and institutional and commercial real estate portfolios.
Return on average common equity was 13.4% for the quarter down from 14% a year ago and 14.8% in the prior
quarter. Assets under custody/administration of $10.9 trillion were flat compared to a year ago and were down
10% on a sequential basis. Assets under custody of $8.3 trillion were up 1% compared to a year ago and down
11% sequentially. Assets under management were $1.1 trillion down 4% on a year-over-year basis and down 9%
on a sequential basis.
Let's look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on page 5. First quarter revenue on a fully taxable
equivalent basis was $1.6 billion, up 7% compared to last year and up 2% sequentially. Trust, investment and
other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue reaching a record $1 billion in the first
quarter, up 8% from last year and up 1% sequentially. Foreign exchange trading income was $89 million in the
first quarter, up 34% year-over-year and up 38% sequentially. The increase is primarily due to higher client
volumes and increased market volatility during the month of March. Remaining components of other noninterest
income were $87 million in the first quarter, up 37% compared to a year ago and up 24% sequentially. Securities
commissions and trading income increased 79% compared to a year ago and 50% sequentially driven by higher
interest rate swap and core brokerage related revenue.
Prior quarter other operating income included a $20.8 million loss relating to the sale of leases. Excluding this
prior period loss the sequential decline was primarily due to lower income associated with supplemental
compensation plans and a market value adjustment for a seed capital investment partially offset by lower Visa
related swap expense and the impact of a full quarter run rate of the bank-owned life insurance program. On a
year-over-year basis, these categories increased primarily due to the bank-owned life insurance program
implemented during 2019 and lower Visa swap related expense partially offset by the market value adjustment for
a seed capital investment and lower income relating to supplemental compensation plans. The year-over-year
and sequential declines relating to the supplemental compensation plan resulted in a related decrease in staff
related expense within the other operating expense line. Net interest income, which I'll discuss in more detail later,
was $416 million in the first quarter, down 3% both year-over-year and sequentially.
Let's look at the components of our trust, investment fees on page 6. For our Corporate & Institutional Services
business fees totaled $574 million in the first quarter and were up 7% year-over-year and up 1% on a sequential
basis. Custody and fund administration fees, the largest component of C&IS fees, were $395 million and up 5%
year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The year-over-year performance was driven by favorable markets and
new business partially offset by unfavorable currency translation. The sequential decline was primarily driven by
unfavorable currency translation partially offset by favorable markets and new business.
Assets under custody/administration for C&IS clients were $10.2 trillion at quarter end flat year-over-year and
down 10% sequentially. The year-over-year performance reflected new business offset by lower market levels
and unfavorable currency translation. The sequential performance is driven by lower market levels and
unfavorable currency translation partially offset by new business. Recall that lagged market values factor into the
5

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
quarter's fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our C&IS custody and fund administration
fees.
Investment management fees in C&IS of $121 million in the first quarter were up 16% year-over-year and up 4%
sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential performance was driven by favorable markets and new
business. Assets under administration for C&IS clients were $843 billion, down 3% year-over-year and down 8%
sequentially. Both the year – both the prior year and sequential comparisons were impacted by lower markets and
favorable currency translation, partially offset by new business flows. The sequential decline was primarily driven
by markets, partially offset by new business and an increase in prior – in period-end securities lending – in period-
end securities lending collateral levels.
Similar to custody and fund administration fees, note that lagged market values factor into C&IS investment
management fees. Securities lending fees were $23 million in the first quarter, up 3% year-over-year and up 4%
sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher volumes, while sequential increase was
primarily driven by higher spreads and volumes. Securities lending collateral was $167 billion at quarter end and
averaged $171 billion across the quarter. Average collateral levels increased 9% year-over-year and 4%
sequentially.
Moving to our Wealth Management business, trust, investment and other servicing fees were $429 million in the
first quarter, were up 9% compared to the prior quarter and up 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was
driven by favorable markets and new business, while favorable markets were also the driver of the sequential
growth. Both month lag and quarter lag asset levels impact Wealth Management fees. Assets under management
were $277 billion quarter end, down 6% year-over-year and down 12% sequentially. The decreases were
primarily driven by unfavorable markets partially offset by new business flows.
Moving to page 7, net interest income was $416 million in the first quarter and down 3% from the prior year.
Earning assets averaged $111 billion in the quarter, flat versus the prior year. Average deposits were $95 billion
and were up 4% versus the prior year. The net interest margin was 1.51% in the first quarter and was down 7
point – 7 basis points from a year ago. The net interest margin decreased primarily due to lower short-term
interest rates, primarily offset by a balance sheet mix shift. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income was
also down 3%. Average earning assets increased 3% on a sequential basis while the net interest margin declined
8 basis points. Looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet, for the first quarter, US dollar deposits
represented 69% of our total average deposits. This was flat to a year ago and up slightly from 68% in the prior
quarter.
Turning to page 8, expenses were $1.1 billion in the first quarter and were 4% higher than the prior year and 1%
lower than the prior quarter. Compensation expense totaled $500 million and was up 4% compared to one year
ago and up 8% sequentially. Last year's compensation expense included $10 million relating to severance related
charges. Excluding these charges, the year-over-year growth was mainly driven by higher salary expense driven
by staff growth and base pay adjustments as well as an accrual for supplemental payment to certain employees in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The sequential increase was primarily due to higher expenses related to long-term performance-based incentive
compensation due to divesting provisions associated with grants to retirement eligible employees in the current
quarter as well as the previously mentioned supplemental payment, partially offset by lower cash-based incentive
cost. The quarter's compensation included $34 million in expense associated with the retirement of eligible staff
compared to $30 million in the prior year. Employee benefit expense of $98 million was up 14% from one-year
ago and 6% sequentially. Both increases were driven by higher retirement plan expenses and payroll taxes. The
6

sequential growth was partially offset by lower medical costs. Outside services of $193 million were up 2% on a
year-over-year basis and down 6% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by increased
third-party advisory fees and technical service costs. The sequential decrease was due to lower consulting, legal
and technical services.
Equipment and software expense of $162 million was up 9% from a year ago and down 2% sequentially. The
year-over-year growth was reflected by higher depreciation – reflected higher depreciation and amortization and
software support costs. Sequentially, the decrease was driven by lower software disposition charges, partially
offset by higher depreciation and amortization.
Occupancy expense of $51 million, decreased 1% from a year ago and was down 11% sequentially. The
sequential decline was primarily due to the renegotiated – renegotiation of a lease resulting in a $7 million
reduction of a related asset retirement obligation. Other operating expense of $62 million was down 15% from a
year ago and down 30% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by lower staff related
expense partially offset by increased contribution to the Northern Trust Charitable Foundation. Sequentially the
decrease was primarily driven by lower staff related and business promotion expenses partially offset by
increased contributions to the charitable foundation.
The lower staff related costs were related to a decline in supplemental compensation plan expenses and resulted
in a related decline in other operating income. As we've discussed on previous calls through our Value for Spend
initiative, which we started in 2017, we've been realigning our expense base with the goal of realizing $250 million
in annualized expense run rate savings. With our results this quarter, we surpassed that goal. While we've
exceeded our goal of $250 million, our efforts around our Value for Spend and overall productivity will broadly not
cease and we further embed a culture of sustainable expense management across the company.
And turning to page 9 our capital ratios remain strong with our common equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.7% under the
standardized approach and 12.9% under the advanced approach. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.1% under both
the standardized and advanced approaches. In the first quarter, as previously announced, the proceeds from the
issuance of Series E preferred stock were used to redeem all outstanding shares of Series C preferred stock.
Deferred issuance cost of $11.5 million were recognized upon redemption which were included in our first quarter
results under preferred dividend line in arriving at net income allocated to common shareholders.
During the first quarter of 2020 the Series E preferred stock dividend was approximately $7.6 million covering the
period from November 5, 2019, through March 31, 2020. The ongoing Series E dividend will be approximately
$4.7 million per quarter with the Series E dividends still occurring semiannually in the first and third quarters of
each year.
Also during the first quarter, we declared cash dividends totaling $149 million to common stockholders. On March
16, we announced temporary suspension of repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program
consistent with broader industry efforts to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by maintaining strong
capital levels and liquidity in the US financial system. Prior to the suspension, we repurchased 3.2 million shares
of common stock at a cost of $297 million.
Let me take a – make a few comments summarizing the quarter as well as comment on some of the headwinds
that we're facing as we move through the remainder of 2020. Despite the impact of a mixed global
macroeconomic environment, we performed well during the quarter, generating a pre-tax margin of 29.4% and a
return on average common equity of 13.4%. Our performance reflects the momentum we carried into 2020 and
we were able to generate positive fee operating leverage and positive total operating leverage on a year-over-

year basis. Our balanced business model continued to generate organic growth with each of our client-facing
reporting segments of Wealth Management and C&IS contributing approximately 50% of our earnings.
Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, the macroeconomic environment's going to certainly create
headwinds for certain revenue lines. First as it create – as it relates to lower expenses, we will of course see
pressure on our net interest margin and net interest income as we move forward through the year. We're currently
anticipating that second quarter net interest income will decline 7% to 10% on a sequential basis.
Next, as I've mentioned in my comments throughout the presentation, it's important to remember that lagged
markets impact the calculation of our trust fees. While month lag and quarter lag equity markets were mainly
favorable for first quarter, we'll see an impact on our fees going forward. One indication of this is our period-end
assets under custody/administration and assets under management declining sequentially by 10% and 9%
respectively. As a reminder, approximately three-quarters of our fees are sensitive to asset levels.
Finally, the newly adopted accounting standard for credit losses makes our reserves for credit losses sensitive to
changes in the macroeconomic environment. If economic conditions continue to worsen over the course of the
year, we can expect to recognize additional provisions. We cannot ignore the macro headwinds pressuring our
revenues as we move forward into 2020.
We remain laser focused on managing our expense base and driving further productivity improvement. It's times
like these that show the importance of a strong capital base and liquidity profile to support our clients' activities
and we continue to provide our clients with the exceptional service and solution expertise they've come to expect.
Thank you again for participating in Northern Trust's first quarter earnings conference call today. Mike, Mark,
Lauren and I are happy to answer any of your questions. Katie, will you please open the line?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you sir. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question will come from Alex Blostein with
Goldman Sachs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning everybody. Thanks for taking the question. So I wanted to start with your guys' thoughts
around the organic fee growth in the current environment. So I think in the past you talked about low- to mid-
single-digit growth across Institutional and Wealth businesses, so wondering how the current sales cycle likely
being extended, how is that impacting the fee growth outlook from an organic basis? And as a kind of follow-up to
that obviously importantly want to get your thoughts on expenses while again similarly you talked about aligning
expense growth with organic fee growth, again, sort of I call it 3% to 5% range. How low can you guys take that
given the current environment and any thoughts around 2020 expense growth would be helpful? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. Good morning Alex. Let me start on the first dynamic of organic growth. It was a strong organic growth
period and I think both year-over-year and then sequentially it was nice to see we had organic growth both in the
C&IS business and used it at a high level with a little over 1% of pure net new business that contributed to the
growth in C&IS and then we also had overall positive growth in the – from an organic perspective in the Wealth
Management side of the business and you don't see it but the asset management business on its own also
provided some positive organic growth which is nice to see. A lot of it was driven by very strong movement into
cash, was looking at over the weekend I think there was over $30 billion in flows overall into that category and our
NIF Treasury Fund is number one in its peer group in investment performance and just that – those – that set of
funds alone has AUM of over $60 billion right now, so in a lot of ways things are going well.
I think it's also important just to take a second to think about some of the interactions we've had with our business
and this I think feeds into your question about how we should think about this in the longer term. And just take
Wealth Management for example, I was talking to some of the leaders there and just some interesting notes, one,
their call report volume, just activity with clients has really skyrocketed, I think over 100% increase in call reports
just from our Central region just gives a sense of the activity there. We do these webinars to teach clients about
and talk more from our experts about what's going on. We typically get about 800 or 900 people show up for
those virtually, and they're at record levels now, is over 3,000 people consistently coming into that.
And then even the marketing material, we track things as granularly as the page views that we get from the
marketing material we send out, that averages about 1,200 page views and over the last several weeks we've
been averaging 6,000 to 10,000. And so I think in the short run it was interesting to see that we were able to
actually close good pieces of new business that was already in the pipeline. I think the very long-term bodes very
well for us, given some of the statistics I just threw out, the engagement we've had with clients. I think if there's an
area of caution, it's going to be in that mid-term pipeline. I think there's just not as few clients that are going to be
spinning up new opportunities, whether it's on the C&IS side they feel the same way or the Wealth side. So I think
we're going to close all the business that we can that was already in kind of the one not funded late in the
pipeline. And I think the long-term looks very good and we can talk about the more countercyclical dynamics of
outsourcing that lead in to help on the new business side for C&IS, but the long-term feels good. I think the short-
term we obviously have to be cautious about.

And then on expenses I'll start, but maybe Mike or Mark will join in. As we think about that we want to bucket it in
a few different categories and probably the best way to think about it might even be just to look through – if you go
to page 7 of the of the earnings release, that outlines expenses pretty well and in more detail and first of all we
had a long list of different paths we could take on this from just saying let expenses play through to let's go ahead
and do a full re-plan of expenses and we took the latter approach. We took a very aggressive detailed approach
to unwrapping our expenses based on what we knew the environment was going to look like in the short run at
least and so we un-bucketed things the way we traditionally do, inflation, productivity, business growth and
investments. And we've been very aggressive at outlining where we can address expenses. Now, if you look at
page 7 the areas that are more related to client activity or markets have to do with outside services and
equipment and software. And super high level roughly you get kind of 30% to 40% of those have that – that type –
that have some correlation to markets and new business. Those are the areas we've been laser focused on but
even on IT investment we're just re-rationalizing everything that we've committed to do.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah, this is Mike. I would just add to what Jason said that there are near term actions that we've already taken
and continue – can continue to take which definitely looks to bring down the expense run rate from where we
were in the fourth quarter and then where we are now. And then just given that the world has changed and will
change, there are new opportunities for productivity over the long-term. I mean if you think about real estate costs
and other costs that come with having everybody in facilities versus now, as I mentioned earlier, we're roughly
90% people working from home, it's not going to stay at that level. But I also don't think the operating model will
be the same once we get through this.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Great that's helpful. And I don't want to put words in your guys' mouth to maybe just to clarify, I guess in
the past you talked about expense growth aligning with organic fee growth and in the near term organic fee
growth sounds like it's obviously going to moderate pretty considerably, so should we think about the total
expense – business expense base being flattish year-over-year or is there a way to bring that down, just hoping to
get some more granularity?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. So you're correct in characterizing the way that we have talked about the organic expense growth rate for
expenses aligning with the fee growth. And so, yes, as that comes down, the fee growth comes down, the organic
expense growth rate comes down as well. And then beyond that, as you're saying Alex, yes, we're also saying
outside of the organic part, just looking at total expenses, we're trying to bring those down. And I wouldn't put a
specific stake in the ground as to whether that's flat or up or down because again some of those expenses are
affected by the environment, but that's what we're trying to drive to. So it is – as Jason said it's a re-plan. There's
no part of it that says we're just plowing through with the same plan that we had at the beginning of the year.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
Hi. Thanks very much. Wonder if I could ask the question, I could use them both on this – on the provision and
the loan book. So if you could talk generically what type of economic backdrop you wrote that provision to
because the world was changing a lot right around quarter end. And then if we could talk about the loan book that
produced most of that. I'm assuming it's almost all in C&I and CRE. So maybe you could talk about what in say
office retail and construction where that is derived from, how much of it is clients that are across the firm versus
some things that are syndicated? I really appreciate we normally don't have much discussion about your loan
book? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure, Glenn. Well, let me just start with some of the assumptions that went into the forecast. I think like a lot of
firms, we – the SEC is very specific in saying you've got to pick a – use your end of period date, use your forecast
at that point to drive your increase or decrease in reserves and so we obviously followed that. If you look at – right
at the end of the period, we were looking at unemployment of 10%. We had a peak to trough change in GDP of
just over 6%. And then as you likely know that's not it, it's not like we have those assumptions and then it spits out
the $61 million provision number. We have a variety – dozens of factors that go from there. And from the number
of forecasts that we use, the weights and the priorities of those forecasts, the downgrade assumptions of the
underlying credits which drive the expected loss assumptions and so you go through a very rigorous governance
process to take the output of the forecast and the model to drive to a final number for provision. After we did that,
like all other financial firms, we went through a new forecasting period.
The economic inputs in the market were changing dramatically. We were watching that closely. So within the next
couple weeks, we went through a forecast that went to an unemployment peak of 14.5% and a peak to trough
GDP change of 7.5%. And so that gives an indication that directionally the provision number, if we were to go
through that same governance process, would have yielded a higher provision number at that point. Now that
said, we didn't go through that same finalization of the governance process after that second forecast was wrong.
We could do that every day. It's a very rigorous process but we followed the letter of what the SEC and what the
accounting guidelines provide us to do. And so we will continue to do those updates as we always do with our
forecasting process and we'll have that rigorous process added to it as we get into the next reporting period.
And then if we want to touch on the loan book itself, why don't we go through some headlines and I'll start and
then maybe Mark can jump in. I think that the key is it's – there's no dramatic difference between what we've told
you before about the loan portfolio and what it is today. There is a lot of other even qualitative assumptions that
go into that – the number that drives the CECL accounting provision number, but why don't we provide a little bit
more information. So Mark I'll turn it over to you for that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah, looking at the entire loan portfolio, over 20% of the loans to a private client is secured by marketable
securities primarily and those are primarily [indiscernible] (00:34:52) Northern Trust. You do have about 20% of
the portfolio which is residential real estate. Again, the nature of those [indiscernible] (00:35:02) is somewhat
unique, I mean for example over 75% of those would have FICO scores of 740 or higher. When you start to look
at the commercial and the commercial real estate, the commercial is predominantly investment grade and on the
commercial real estate side, the lending is to investors as opposed to developers. And over 95% of those
commercial real estate loans have personal guarantees as well, so pretty high quality. When we look at the C&I
portfolio as far as where the high impact or low impacts might be from the current situation that we find ourselves
in, we would say we're very much predominantly in what we would hope is in the lower impact when we look at
the kind of industry segmentation there.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
So just one tiny clarification, the GDP numbers that you mentioned, is that full year 2020 or second quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
No, no, that's for the full year. That's – that would be the peak to trough change for the full year. So at a high level,
the assumption that we used had very sharp second quarter decline and then a relatively strong recovery but not
to the current levels of GDP.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Carrier Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. First, can you provide a bit more color on the net interest
income outlook particularly given the rise in deposits and expectations in this backdrop with a lot of liquidity out
there? Coming into the NIM, just how you're thinking about the portfolio and reinvestment rates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. Thanks Mike. I'll start. Well first of all the more time we spend around NII, I think what jumps out to me is
that the key is actually less the size of the balance sheet which is driven so much by the deposit growth. It has
much more to do with what's happening with loan volume. And if you think about it, the size of the balance sheet
and the size of average earning assets is going to be dominated by client deposits coming on. And in a different
interest rate environment, that's going to have an impact on NII. But in the short run you think about it and on an
incremental basis, we're not investing those deposits long and we're not investing them with credit risk either. And
so the dynamic there is that effectively you're bringing – the size is driven by deposits that are going to be
reinvested a lot in IOER 10 basis points and maybe something – somewhat different than that but not
dramatically.
The things that are going to drive NII more are going to be really two things. One, the volume of loans and then
secondly, we've talked about this before, but the spread of one-month LIBOR to the bottom end of the Fed funds
or IOER, very important. It really gives you a sense of – of the NII impact of the – a lot of the earning assets and
how those are going to behave and contribute to NII and so those are really the big factors. And so – yeah, I
mentioned that because I think it's just important to decouple and not try and predict NII based on where that
1.51% in NIM is going to go. I think you have to have more of a bottoms-up approach of thinking about particularly
loans and then what is LIBOR going to do. LIBOR has been coming down a couple basis points a day effectively,
and where you think that the trajectory there is going to go is a very important factor.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Carrier Q

Yeah, we – a lot of the information out there will help track that a little bit, but as we sit today none of the large
funds are in a position where their yields are below their fee rates and if we look out on that a little bit we – you
guys can see as much as we can. Without a real contrarian approach you don't see that changing at least in the
next several weeks or so. Now, that said, I mentioned early in the opening that our NIF Treasury Fund at $60
billion to $70 billion, you get if – at 15 to 20 basis points in fees, if we fall below those rates by even 5 basis
points, you're talking about annual run rate, just from a math perspective, of potentially $30 million and we're not
there yet, but if we were to try and point you to something to track in between the time that we're able to talk
publicly, those would be the line items to look at.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks very much for taking the questions. Maybe just staying with the balance sheet for a minute on that
LIBOR to IOER spread, I guess down the 7% to 10% down, is that considering current LIBOR, one-month LIBOR
rates or that – or are you factoring in LIBOR to compress further with that and if you could just remind us again on
the loan repricing mechanism, I think it's three quarters of loans repriced quarterly to one-month LIBOR with the
rest lagged for one year, if you could just remind us on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So just to start with the end it's actually – I think it's a little higher than that. It's about 80% of the loan book
is actually floating at this point and that's tied very mostly to LIBOR. And then to what our assumptions are, the
down 7% to 10% number we provided is reflective of a tightening of the spread between LIBOR and IOER. And
so we've looked at that and continue to think that that's going to compress a decent amount. On a spot basis, I
haven't looked at it this morning, but last week, it was kind of – that LIBOR at kind of 70, 72 basis points against
an IOER of 10 and we think that could continue to narrow a fair amount. If you think about where LIBOR was just
a couple weeks ago, it's significantly higher than that. And so we certainly feel like that's got to be part of any
projection.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Okay. And deposit levels April versus the period end in the 7% to 10% guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Down. You'll see the last page of the press release even just where the balance sheet ended at $160 billion or so
and again that's all – that's – the size of the balance sheet is completely driven by the size of client deposits. And
there was significant increase throughout the quarter and frankly there were increases – significant increases and
we ended not at where it peaked. And so we – the balance sheet has had very strong growth in clients – it's all
about client activity. That's clients de-risked and came out of larger equity positions or other fixed income
positions. They wanted balance sheets that they were comfortable with and they were comfortable with ours and
we wanted to be there for them. And since then we've had deposit levels come down significantly from those
peaks and [ph] probably they've been more on kind of the 140 to 145 range (00:43:43) range and in that type of –
in that type of area over the beginning of the second quarter but – and that's still elevated relative to what – where
we experienced historically and – at peaks or at the end of the first quarter.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hi, thanks. Good morning. On the balance sheet, Jason, can you talk through where the floating [ph] six – mix is
(00:44:22) of the balance sheet right now, what the duration of the portfolio is and just how do you decide based
on your prior response about the ins and outs of deposits, where you're going with reinvestment yield so much
lower in terms of the asset side of earning assets distribution? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yes. Thank you, Ken. And yeah we've – we are reinvesting short is the quick answer to the question. And we
want to – we don't feel that there's potential – that the potential need from clients to have very spiky aggressive
needs and desires to be on the balance sheet is necessarily over. And so we want to make sure we've got plenty
of dry powder and plenty of capacity for them on both the loans and deposits side. And so we're taking the short
term approach of being there for our clients. Our duration, I think at the beginning of last year of 2019 probably
was around 1.1. We had stepped that out. We told the investment community, we were going to step it out. We'd
gotten all the way out to about 2. And since then, very recently as we're reinvesting maturing securities, that'll
come in a little bit as we position the portfolio to maintain maximum capacity. Over – that's not reflective of a long-
term strategy but it is reflective of our desire to be there for clients in the short run.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q

And the fixed-floating mix, do you have that available?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A

Yeah. Mark?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. The split between the shorter securities book and the longer, we've – it's been running closer to 50/50
historically. I think more recently the longer book was a little larger.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A

And then as Jason said, as we reinvest, depending on where those reinvestments go, that could shift a little bit,
but – and balance a little bit tilted towards the longer side of where it was on average during the quarter.

And the funding side we think of as more 50/50 and we try and stay matched on that reflectively on the
reinvestment side. I think as we continue to go shorter in the near term that's going to lean a little bit more short,
but in the long run it's about kind of maintaining that – maintaining the hedge.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Just – my question was answered but just one follow-up. You said 90% of people are working from home. Can
you elaborate more on what sort of more permanent business model change that might lead to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Mike, this is Mike. In the way that we thought about the operating model over time, it's never been one that
we thought in a stabilized way that we would be at 90% working outside of facilities. Frankly what we've learned
through this crisis is that we can meet client needs and be able to operate the business, execute the business
even at that high level of remote working. Having said that, this is not the level that we want to sustain. We'll have
to be careful as we have people return to the office. That will happen in a phased approach. But frankly longer
term, as I mentioned, I think that there are opportunities because if even went beyond just the ability to serve our
clients and think about efficiency, we may have lost some efficiency during this time period but frankly it's also, I
would say, demonstrated that there are inefficiencies in having everybody come in and out of the facilities around
the globe and that there is certain work that is easier to have our partners, our employees do remotely or even if
it's not completely remotely, do they come into a facility for a portion of the week. Things like that.
And that also aligns with some of the things we've been doing over time about our workspaces. It's – as you
would expect, it's not all about everybody having an office or even a cubicle, it's more about open spaces and
flexible workspaces and things like that and that fits in with not having everybody reporting into the office at the
same time. So we don't have the complete long-term operating model at this point but, again, I don't believe it'll go
back to the way it was. And I think frankly it'll present opportunities for both greater efficiency and I think for our
employees additional satisfaction on their overall work life.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And as it relates to customers, I mean you see schools going online, you're seeing Zoom Meetings, you're seeing
telemedicine. On the other hand, your customers are at the very high end and they probably want face-to-face
service, but what's your flexibility there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah, without a doubt, and as you point out, we have a high engagement model in Wealth Management and yet if
you – if someone thought it was all about the facilities, then we would have been going the opposite direction for
the last several years, right, in the sense of we actually have fewer offices now for Wealth Management than we
15

did 5 years ago, 10 years ago. And that's because that engagement at the higher level often happens at the
client's office, at the client's home and also through technology, through using video-conferencing and just the
ability for clients to interact directly with their account online, on their phone, et cetera. So it's a multifaceted
engagement model and one that again we think we can differentiate ourselves in this. Jason talked about some of
the calling statistics. If you talk to our partners in Wealth Management, as we said, they've been more engaged
over this time period than the three months, let's say, prior to it, a lot of that because of all the activity but also
they've used different ways to do it. So, we look forward to when we can meet more with clients, but that doesn't
necessarily mean it has to happen in an office.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Hi, good morning. So you noted earlier in a question relating to credit that you have lower exposure to the higher
risk industry categories. Given some of the stress in energy markets, I was hoping you could speak to any direct
exposure to the energy sector, maybe what specific energy categories in particular, such as E&P, midstream, et
cetera?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah, so at a high level the exposure to energy is very, very low. And a lot of our – we've got a lot of clients that
had garnered their wealth from the industry, but our lending exposure specifically to oil and gas is very, very low.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Okay. And just one follow-up from me, Jason. You gave lots of detail on deposits. Just given the significant
growth, the bulk of that's being deployed into IOER. If I look at the balance sheet during the prior three QE cycles,
now you had a lot of QE driven deposit growth. A lot of those deposits actually stayed on the balance sheet. And
your approach was pretty balanced in terms of how much was deployed into securities versus IOER. I'm just
wondering why would things play out differently this time, and maybe just how you're thinking about the mix where
for every incremental deposit how much of that should we assume goes into IOER or versus securities that
admittedly you're going to be short dated to ensure that you have greater flexibility from a liquidity standpoint?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Frankly this is about trying to ensure we're there for clients in the long run and we could make short term calls
saying let's extend a little bit. And even if we missed the yield curve a little, we don't have stories from our clients
where we weren't there for them. We have been able to do a lot. We've got ample room from a Tier 1 leverage
perspective, from liquidity perspectives and – but we talk all the time about our balance sheet being there for
clients and so we want to live up to that and not fall to temptation of trying to use the deposits and go very long.
Now you're absolutely right that there is an element of these deposits that's going to stick around a while and that
will enable us – particularly the Wealth deposits are very valuable. Once those season and are here, it enables us
to extend more and invest those more, whether it's in loans or non-high quality liquid assets and that creates a lot
of value for us. We just want to be patient and make sure that we don't do that too early. But some of the growth
that we've had on the deposit side over the last year or – even not just the last month and a half but over the last
year it reflects a higher base level of deposits and a lot of it on the Wealth side which is very, very valuable.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. First question is a follow-up on the expenses. So you talked about
some of the actions taken. You helped us understand the pieces that were subject to volumes. And when I take a
look at the midpoint of that, I think you said it was outside services and equipment and software, 30% to 40%. So
if you take the midpoint, that's about 10% your annual expenses. Does that mean that things outside of that
bucket of expenses, you're going to be able to calibrate and the – that 10% we should grow maybe at an elevated
rate, given some of the things that are going on. Can you help us think about what at least logically might come
into play when we try to calibrate how to forecast your expense growth for the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason J. Tyler A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Sure. So if we come back to that framework, that page, I'll give you a little bit more of how I think about the
subcategories in there. So outside services – and some – the headlines – some of these things are going to be
mixed, some will be able to moderate lower and some are going to have more activity as we've invested to make
sure that we've got good operational resiliency. And so within outside services, for example, a lot of that is
consulting and legal costs. Well, on the consulting side, there are going to be projects that we had planned to do,
we went through our original planning process that don't necessarily chin the bar at this point or that we're just
going to delay for a period of time or that we're going to do with a reduced scope. And so those are the types of
conversations we have there.
On legal, we actually hinted very quickly I think in the script that we've had some benefit, some things go our way
on some legal matters and so that's part of the benefit that we've had in there. If you think about equipment and
software, that's an interesting line item because even within there, there are items that will go both ways. We've
also invested more heavily in infrastructure there but at the same time, that's where there is some capital IT
projects that we might not do. And then there's also an overlay on both of these where we have to think about
what's related to the core business either from an assets perspective or just client activity, things like market data,
third-party advisory fee, sub-custody, brokerage clearing, those are the some of those line items that will add up
to that kind of roughly 30% to 40% number that we're thinking about.
And then in occupancy, just to refresh your memory on some of the things we've talked about, we had already
been in late stages of some – of some larger transitions and investments and we talked about the fact that in the
short run, we might have some overlap in rent and investment. And we think that's going to peak around second
quarter and then we should get the benefit of that more in the second half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. That helps. Thank you. And when we think about – I think you mentioned the legal benefits that you've
been receiving in some of these lines. Could you help us maybe calibrate how much that helped 1Q, if we should
think about any of that? I would think legal benefits are somewhat episodic but is that the right way to think about
it or is that some – is there some sustainability to those benefits? Any noise calibration would also be helpful.
Thanks.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Brennan, this is Mark. I mean I would start with the outside services category. You do get consulting and
legal as two expenses that I would say will fluctuate based on engagements. So – and when you look at, in
general, how much they make-up of the category, it's actually a fairly small percentage, it's just that they can be
volatile from quarter-to-quarter. So they might make-up 15% to 20% of the expenses that's even [ph] out of the
(00:59:20) category, but they do – based on timing of engagements, they'll go favorable or they might pop-up in a
given quarter. I would say this quarter was one where the engagements were lower and there was some [ph]
asset in the (00:59:34) expense that we realized. But I don't know that I would necessarily portray it as a trend.
But contractor expenses and things like that, they go into things like consulting certainly that's something that can
be an area that we can focus on managing.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Kleinhanzl Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I hear what you're saying about the NII being down in the second quarter,
but how do you think about it then after the second quarter? Is there a period of time that the liabilities will catch-
up on the repricing side and kind of how we think about deposit betas moving forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Well, I think that in – there are two competing factors there, one, is our desire in the short run to make sure that
we're maximizing loan capacity effectively for our clients. I think – but in the longer run this base of business – this
base of deposits that's more core, we'll be able to invest in a better way. The counter to that is that the duration
that we built in the portfolio will start to dissipate and so the more we're reinvesting of the portfolio that we had
coming into this year, the more we're going to experience the impact of lower nominal rates. And even so – even
if we were taking longer duration into – even if we're extending the portfolio from a reinvestment perspective, we'll
be doing so with – in a lower interest rate environment. And so that – those competing factors will operate and I
think it's up to everybody to have their own determinations of what they think the interest rate environment's going
to look like in the intermediate term.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Kleinhanzl Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And then just a second question on the custody and fund admin fees. Is there any way to tease out what the
pickup in activity meant for fees in the quarter like comparing fourth quarter to first quarter? I know some clients
are price based on activity levels? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Brian, it's Mark. So I would say that when you look at the sequential performance for custody and fund
services, there was a – there was some market benefit. Again, there is month lag and quarter lag fees. There are
more month lag than quarter lag and actually the EAFE local was slightly negative on a month lag sequential
basis. So there was a little bit of market pickup but there was also to Jason's point earlier about the 1% sequential
kind of organic – 1-ish percent organic growth – we usually look at organic on year-over-year but sequentially
that's probably in the right range, a little more than that. There was a drag from currency. So that's kind of – those
18


Northern Trust Corp.
(NTRS) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
are the largest factors. There's also some other non-asset level fees that were a little bit down sequentially on
things like account level fees and things like that but – so overall kind of balanced out to flattish I would say.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Just wanted to just go over that – the pricing on the custody business and
the Wealth Management business. I know the mix has changed over time because you've been servicing more
people in the administrative basis, particularly in alternatives and that's created a little bit more of an averaging
mix than it used to be historically. But if you could just review within the C&IS asset servicing business what
portion of that book is priced on a quarter-end lag versus more of an averaging basis and then just staying within
Wealth Management, a portion of that is priced on that one month lag – I think the custody part that that you don't
manage in Wealth Management, I think that's on a prior quarter lag if I'm not mistaken, maybe if you're able to just
review that price difference?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah. Yeah, Brian this is Mark. So – yeah, it's pretty similar to what we've said before. So with custody and fund
administration first and this is in C&IS, there is about 35% to 40% – call it 40% of fees that are not asset value
sensitive, so that's the first part. Of the fees that are asset value sensitive, so the remaining 60%, about three
quarters of those are month lag and a quarter of them are quarter lag which is similar to what we've – what we
would have updated a year ago. I think last time we had a change in markets when we gave that update. And
then remember as far as the asset sensitive, it's not all equity exposure because we have an allocation across
multiple asset classes. When you get to the Wealth Management side, I would probably divide it between the
regions and the Global Family Office. The Global Family Office business you're right, there is a – that is probably
more leaned towards the quarter lag. It's similar to the asset servicing business in C&IS. And there's also about a
quarter of those fees that aren't asset sensitive, more like what you see on the asset servicing side of C&IS. And
the regions, and I would combine the regions together, then you're looking at about three quarters or more of
those fees being month lag. So, hopefully that gives you an idea, not a significant change though from what we've
said before there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.

the credit provision, if you could just reiterate that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. So, the baseline that we went with for the March 31 – for the reporting cycle had a peak to trough down a
little over 6% – 6.1%. And then the update subsequent to that is it's down 7.5%.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Morning, Betsy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I had two questions. One, just on the comments that you made earlier in the call around the medium-term caution
in the pipeline, could you just give us a sense as to the drivers of that and how long you think that – what your
view of medium term is and then maybe you could give us a sense as to – this is really just a push out not an
evaporation, so maybe you could speak to how that comes back into your run rate as things open up?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. Betsy, it's Mike. I'll add on to what Jason said earlier. So, if you think about the flow of new business, there's
business that we've won and it's a matter of transitioning that business on and one of the things that, again I want
to give credit to our team on, is the fact that even in the month of March, with everything that happened, we were
able to transition the majority of the business that was scheduled to be transitioned.
So in that sense – that's why we say right now that will look good. Having said that, there are new mandates that
were to transition in April, for example, or May or June that it's not only that we're in, I'll call it, the work from home
mode but that the clients are as well. And so they've said let's move our transition back further. So they're
deferred transitions. So, when Jason talked about in the medium term, that would be new business that would
come on, for example, in the second or the third quarter, that now has been moved back.
And then if you then also think about what's happening with the client base, certainly winning new clients is new
business for us but it's also the flow activity that they have, whether that's an institutional client and what they're
doing with their funds, are they more in a spending mode if you will, utilizing mode if they're a sovereign wealth
fund that's been impacted by the environment or if they're an asset manager, are they part of the market that is a
net gainer of flows or a net outflow. And that of course then will impact us as well.
And then the last piece is just well what about new business activity where you're in the process of winning. Yes,
there's some slowdown in I would say mandate type decisions, but also with a lot of activity like this, we do see
plenty of our clients that are saying, we've been talking about outsourcing for some time period, whether that's the
whole middle office or that's trading, you know what, now that we've gone through this time period, we can see
that you're in a better position to do that for us than for us to do on our own, so let's continue that dialogue and
then we can figure out when we'll decide to do it and hopefully do it with us as well. And so that happened – that's
why we say longer term we see a lot of opportunities, but that's not going to impact the third or fourth quarter of
this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Right. So the medium term and the push out of the pipeline install is really a function of when you can get back
into clients' offices which is a little bit TBD, but it's a push out not an evaporation?

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And then could you speak a little bit to how you're thinking about the buybacks. I know that you stopped them but
you obviously have a significant amount of capital. Just wondering how you're thinking about what the triggers will
be for you to restart up?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Betsy, it's Mike again. So with regard to capital management and specifically share repurchases, as you know,
there's been a tremendous amount of attention and rigor around capital management going back to the financial
crisis, so in that sense I would say we feel very good about the process around capital management and how we
think about capital actions and the stress testing that we do, et cetera. And the reality is that now we're in an
actual stress. And so it is an opportunity to be able to demonstrate that we can execute then on our capital
actions the way that we thought of when we were going through various stress scenarios. So being able to pull
the lever on share repurchase, like we did in say tremendous amount of uncertainty, we can stop that very easily.
That's the benefit of share repurchases and we've said for the foreseeable future and that's just because the
environment can change and there are many factors that go into it as you know, but looking at our capital levels,
looking at the profitability levels, the stress testing results with the Fed, all of that plays into the board's decision
on how they think about capital action. So just as it was easy I would say to pull the lever to stop share
repurchases, technically it's very easy to push the lever the other direction, it's more just being able to assess the
environment and the outlook at the time to be able to determine when that's appropriate.

I'd like to follow up on the credit comments. Northern Trust is obviously very well regarded when it comes to
credit. You guys have done phenomenal job in the last 20 years. It was interesting in 2001 there was exposure to
Enron which surprised everybody that Northern would have that kind of credit and what we discovered was as
part of the employment benefits processing that you did for Enron, you were asked to join the revolver line what
they did at the time. Are there any of those outside situations today that we just wouldn't expect Northern to have
a credit exposure? I'm not asking for specific names, but just to X, Y, Z companies like, wow, how did that
happen? Is there any of that on the books today versus what it was in 2001?

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 21-Apr-2020
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Well, I appreciate the historical perspective on that, going back to 2001 and I would say as far as the nature of
how we think about credit, it's still very similar. I mean it's aligned with our overall business and with holistic
relationships. So that has not changed. And specifically to clients where we are the custodian for their pension
plan, we often then are participating in their credit facilities. Now when you look at that portfolio companies, it still
goes through a very rigorous credit process and so it's a very high quality set of companies as well as high quality
set of credits. There's no way that we can necessarily predict which sectors are going to be impacted by a
particular stress scenario. And so we wouldn't make the type of statement to say we have no exposures to any
sectors that are troubled right now, certainly we do. But all of that we try to manage the size of the exposures for
that and that's just – you've just identified one area which is on the corporate side. Certainly we work with asset
managers, so we're providing credit to the different types of asset managers. And then on the Wealth side the
nature of where wealth is developed and so that can either be the companies that are owned by families but also
the individual credit needs. As Mark mentioned about 20% of our portfolio overall is basically margin lending. It's
collateralized by their investment portfolio. And so that would reflect the nature of that credit needs for that part of
the client base.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Hi. Thanks for accommodating the follow-up. I just wanted to make sure – it's a quick modeling question. The
other income line there was a lot noise this quarter. As we think about the right jumping off point for 2Q given with
some of the BOLI tailwinds how should we be thinking about the appropriate run rate beginning in the second
quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Sure. Mark...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Yeah, even I can try to take that. So it is a hard one because there is a lot that moves around within that category.
I guess one way that I've kind of talked about – I think even on the last call we kind of talked about it. Certainly
you have BOLI that has come in incrementally in each of the last four quarters with this quarter being about $13
million. So if you took BOLI out as well as some of the things that we've had like last quarter we had a lease loss
of $20.8 million, if you adjust taking BOLI out of the last four quarters and adjust for the things we've called out
and you kind of did the math, you're probably looking at an average run rate of call it $33 million, $34 million. And
then in theory you could then say okay well let me add the full run rate of BOLI in and add $13 million to that. So
maybe that gets you to the $45 million, $47 range. I would just caution though it is a very – there is volatility in that
line. So it's a hard one. There's things like currency hedging that flows through that line. We've talked about some
of the things that this quarter some of the marks might flow through that line. The Visa related income/expense
type of swap marks flow through that line as well. So it certainly does move around, but if you looked at it over a
longer period, you could use that potentially as kind of an average run rate.

Operator: Thank you...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
Great. And really – I'm going to save Mark a follow-up call because I do have the AUM breakout.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark M. Bette A
Senior Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, Northern Trust Corp.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael G. O'Grady A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Northern Trust Corp.
So cash AUM at about $235 billion at period end. Fixed income about $150 billion and I'm going to lump index
and active equity at about $425 billion and then call the rest other and leave it there.
