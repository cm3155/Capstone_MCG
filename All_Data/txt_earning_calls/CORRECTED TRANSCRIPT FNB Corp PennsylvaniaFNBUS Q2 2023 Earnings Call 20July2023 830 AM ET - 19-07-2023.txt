Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Vincent J. Delie, Jr.
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Vince Calabrese, our Chief
Financial Officer; and Gary Guerrieri, our Chief Credit Officer. F.N.B. reported second quarter net income
available to common stockholders of $140.4 million or $0.39 per diluted common share at an operating and
reported basis. This brings the total year-to-date operating earnings per share to $0.79, a 39% increase over the
same period in 2022.
Operating pre-provision net revenue increased 51% year-to-date, resulting in an improvement in the efficiency
ratio to 50% and an increase in operating return on tangible common equity to 19.1%. Average total loans
increased 2.1% linked-quarter to over $31 billion. Commercial loan balances benefited from solid production,
primarily in the Pittsburgh, Harrisburg and North and South Carolina markets.
Average deposits totaled over $34 billion, a 1.3% decrease from the first quarter, largely due to seasonal deposit
outflows caused by tax-related payments and the impact of the inflationary macroeconomic environment on our
clients.
Despite the acceleration of deposit competition caused by the recent banking disruption, the mix of non-interest-
bearing deposits to total deposits at June 30 remained relatively stable at 32%. The loan-to-deposit ratio was
92.7% at quarter-end. Our strong deposit mix was a result of the focus on fostering relationships with our
customers and serving as their primary bank. Over the past several years, we've enhanced our product suite and
digital capabilities, grown our exceptional team of bankers, and strategically expanded our market presence to
offer best-in-class experiences for our customers that builds convenience, trust and a stable deposit base.
For example, we recently launched the Common App, Common Account Application in our award-winning eStore,
where we intend to be the first bank to offer a single universal application for the majority of our products and
services, enabling customers with the ability to apply for multiple products simultaneously. Utilizing advanced
technology, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, the eStore Common App delivers a more
efficient and secure application process with sophisticated data capabilities to offer customized product
recommendations that cater to specific customer needs. By pre-filling numerous fields, the Common Application
minimizes customer keystrokes and significantly reduces the amount of time needed to complete an application
for multiple products.
The first phase of the Common Application, which we launched last month, includes all consumer loan products.
Consumer deposit products will be added by the end of 2023, and business products will follow shortly after, in
the first half of 2024. The streamlined process has led to an increase of over 170% in online applications for the
month of June compared to a year ago. And we expect this number to continue to increase as we actively
promote the capability.
Outside of digital, we have continued to invest in our fee-based services offering. We are now expanding our
award-winning treasury management platform with strategic priorities to drive organic growth, increase revenue
and generate low-cost deposits. This quarter alone, clients of our new integrated payable solutions product
executed nearly $1 billion of payment, while simultaneously benefiting from check outsourcing and reduced fraud
risk.
We've also leveraged integrated payables to continue to grow our commercial card revenue, which has a 19%
compounded annual growth rate over the past three years and continues to expand through deeper penetration
with commercial and small business clients. These investments and our comprehensive set of products and

services continue to help F.N.B. grow non-interest-bearing deposit accounts and further diversify our fee-based
income streams, providing customers with high-value services.
F.N.B. continues to steadily increase market share. This quarter's 12% spot loan growth year-over-year has been
achieved while adhering to our consistent and conservative underwriting guidance. Risk management remains an
integral part of our culture.
I will now turn the call over to Gary to comment in more detail on our asset quality and credit risk. Gary?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. We ended the quarter with our asset quality metrics remaining
near historically low levels. Our performance for the period reflects total delinquency that ended the quarter at 75
basis points, NPLs and OREO at 47 basis points, and net charge-offs at 11 basis points. Criticized loans were
down 1 basis point quarter-over-quarter and classified assets were down 16 basis points. I will cover these asset
quality highlights for the quarter in more detail, followed by an update on our office portfolio.
Let's now walk through our credit results. Total delinquency increased 15 basis points in the quarter. And NPLs
and OREO, as a percent of total loans, were up 9 basis points compared to the prior quarter. The increase in
NPLs and OREO was primarily attributed to a single $32 million C&I loan placed on non-performing status. At
quarter-end, we reserved for approximately 40% of our exposure. This credit surfaced right at the end of the
quarter from an emerging issue between our borrower and their primary business partner.
Net charge-offs for the quarter totaled $8.7 million or 11 basis points on an annualized basis, with 8 basis points
reflecting the use of previously established specific reserves. Total provision expense for the quarter stood at
$18.5 million, providing for loan growth and the previously mentioned specific reserve, offset by releases from the
reduction in classified loans.
Our ending funded reserve increased $9.3 million in the quarter and stands at $413 million or a solid 1.32% of
loans, reflecting our strong position relative to our peers. When including acquired unamortized loan discounts,
our reserve stands at 1.48% and our NPL coverage position remains strong at 325% inclusive of the unamortized
loan discounts.
We remain committed to consistent underwritings and strong credit risk management to maintain a balanced,
well-positioned portfolio throughout economic cycles. We proactively review and stress test portfolios on an
ongoing basis, including in the current quarter where we performed a full company-wide stress test consistent
with prior years. We were pleased with the outcome of the results as it confirms that our diversified portfolio and
proactive credit risk management enables us to withstand various economic downturn scenarios.
Regarding the office portfolio, delinquency remains very low at 26 basis points and criticized loans remained
below 10% with no negative migration in the quarter. We renewed all commercial real estate loans secured by
office properties that matured in the quarter with no downgrades required. We have and will continue to
proactively manage this portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis, as part of the in-depth reviews we regularly perform.
In closing, asset quality metrics remain near historical lows, and we continue to generate diversified loan growth
in attractive markets. We closely monitor macroeconomic trends and the individual markets in our footprint, and
we'll continue to manage risk proactively and aggressively as part of our core credit philosophy, which has served
us well throughout various economic cycles.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
I will now turn the call over to Vince Calabrese, our Chief Financial Officer, for his remarks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr.
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Thanks, Gary, and good morning. Today, I will focus on the second quarter's financial results and offer guidance
updates for the remainder of 2023. Second quarter net income available to common shareholders totaled $140.4
million or $0.39 per diluted common share on both an operating and reported basis, bringing total year-to-date
operating earnings to $0.79 per share.
On a spot basis, loans and leases ended the quarter at $31 billion, growing $681 million or 2.2% linked-quarter.
Consumer loans increased $517 million, with strong seasonal contributions on the Physicians First mortgage
program. Commercial loans and leases grew $164 million or 0.8% with loan spreads improving from the first
quarter levels.
Investment portfolio decreased slightly to $7.2 billion as we redeployed cash to support loan growth. The total
securities portfolio remains at a fairly even split between AFS and HTM, with 47% in available for sale and a
duration of 4.5 years at quarter-end.
Total deposits ended the quarter at $33.8 billion, a decrease of $365 million linked-quarter or a 1.1%, primarily
due to seasonal deposit outflows and tax-related payments and the impact of the inflationary macroeconomic
environment. The deposit mix continued to shift this quarter as customers moved $586 million into time deposits,
partially offsetting the decline of $273 million in interest-bearing demand deposits and $383 million in non-interest-
bearing demand deposits.
As of June 30, non-interest-bearing demand deposits comprised 32% of total deposits, compared to 33% at
March 31. While the banking industry disruptions clearly accelerated deposit competition, we still expect the mix
of non-interest-bearing demand to total deposits to remain above pre-COVID levels.
The loan-to-deposit ratio increased to 92.7% during the quarter, reflecting strong loan growth and the seasonal
effect of tax payments on our deposits. Revenue totaled $410 million, driven by net interest income of $329
million and stable non-interest income benefiting from our diversified fee businesses. Second quarter's net
interest margin was 3.37%, with the quarterly decline expected to slow as the month of June was 3.34%. The
yield on earning assets increased 26 basis points to 4.94% due to higher yields on loans, investment securities
and interest-bearing deposits with banks. While the cost of funds increased 46 basis points to 1.64%, as the cost
of interest-bearing deposits increased 47 basis points to 1.97%. We continue to actively manage our total deposit
costs, which ended the quarter at 1.47%, bringing the total cumulative deposit betas to 27%. We expect to end
2023 in the mid-30s.
Turning to non-interest income and expense. Non-interest income totaled $80.3 million, a 1% increase from a
solid first quarter level. Service charges increased $1.4 million or 4%, reflecting strong treasury management
services and interchange fees, offsetting the overdraft practice changes that F.N.B. implemented in the first
quarter of 2023. Dividends on non-marketable securities increased $1.4 million or 33%, reflecting higher FHLB
dividends due to additional borrowings.
Insurance commissions and fees decreased $1.8 million or 23% due to normal seasonality and strong overall
production in the first quarter. Our wealth management business continued to generate strong contributions with
combined revenue of $17.7 million, up 12% on a year-over-year basis.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Non-interest expense totaled $212 million, a decrease of $8 million, or nearly 4% from last quarter. Salaries and
employee benefits decreased $6.3 million, primarily from seasonal compensation that occurred in the first quarter,
partially offset by normal annual merit increases in the second quarter and higher commissions driven by better-
than-expected contributions from our mortgage banking and fee-based businesses.
The efficiency ratio equaled 50.0%, given the strong revenue and well-managed expenses. Our capital ratios
remained solid throughout the quarter with a CET1 ratio at our 10% targeted level. Our TCE ended the quarter at
7.47%, and when adjusting for our held-to-maturity investment market equaled 6.8%, which we expect to remain
higher than peer median levels. We also repurchased 2.3 million shares during the quarter at a weighted average
price of $10.80.
Tangible book value per common share was $8.79 at June 30, an increase of $0.13 per share from March 31,
largely from the higher level of earnings, offsetting the increased impact of AOCI, which reduced tangible book
value by $0.99 per share compared to $0.87 at the end of the prior quarter.
Let's now look at the 2023 financial objectives, starting with the balance sheet. On a full-year spot basis, we
maintain our previous guide for loans to increase mid-single digits year-over-year. Total deposit balances are
revised, and 2023 down low-single digits relative to the December 31, 2022 spot balances. We expect year-end
levels to be flattish to the June 30 level of $33.8 billion as seasonality should become a tailwind in the second half
of 2023.
Full-year net interest income is expected to be between $1.28 billion and $1.32 billion, with the third quarter of
2023 between $313 million to $323 million. Our guidance currently assumes a 25-basis-point rate hike next week,
then flat for the remainder of the year. The decrease in guidance from last quarter is largely related to our
expectations of higher deposit betas, driven by strong competition for deposits and continued mix shift into time
deposits. We still expect the ratio of non-interest-bearing demand to total deposits to remain above pre-COVID
levels.
Full-year non-interest income is expected to be between $315 million and $325 million, with the third quarter
expected to be around $80 million. This upward revision incorporates the benefit of our diversified fee-based
income strategy. Full-year guidance for non-interest expense on an operating basis is expected to be at the high
end of our prior guidance of $835 million to $855 million, largely due to higher commissions tied to better-than-
expected fee income. The third quarter non-interest expense is expected to be between $210 million to $215
million.
Full-year provision guidance remains $65 million to $85 million and is dependent on net loan growth and potential
CECL model-related bills from a softer macroeconomic environment. Lastly, the effective tax rate should be
between 20% and 21% for the full year, which does not include any investment tax credit activity that may occur.
With that, I will turn the call back to Vince.

innovative suite of products and services, conservative balance sheet management, and our culture rooted in risk
management. All of this is made possible by our talented and dedicated employees. Our philosophy enables us to

showcasing the impact our employees have on our performance.
Our capital position remains strong with CET1 at our targeted operating level of 10%, while supporting loan
growth and share repurchase activity in the quarter. The tangible book value per share continues to grow, totaling
$8.79 this quarter, up 8.6% year-over-year. As we look to the second half of the year, we remain uniquely
positioned to capitalize on disruption and are poised to continue to drive shareholder value.

Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question.

Good morning, Daniel.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
I guess, first, yeah, just on the non-interest – non-interest-bearing deposit balances. I'm not sure if I heard you.
Did you have an explicit assumption baked into your guidance for where those end up at the end of the year? And
I know you mentioned they would end up above pre-COVID. I was just wondering if you had a little more detail on
whereabouts you're kind of thinking that could land?
And then, also just kind of within the quarter, if you had any comments on the cadence of the mix shift, if it slowed
throughout the quarter, if there was any kind of pattern we might pick up on there. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I would say, the non-interest-bearing deposits, we did not have a specific target. As a percent of deposits,
we mentioned, we're at 32%, down from 33%. And pre-COVID, we were at kind of 26% or so, and not looking for
us to migrate down to that [indiscernible] (00:22:20) which is kind of we expect to – going to be higher than that. In
my mind, the target would be 30% handle, if we can keep it to 30% handle as move forward. We do have
seasonal municipal deposits that kind of build from here through October and November period that would affect
that non-interest-bearing line item.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
And it's a big focus in the company. It's been for 15 years, 16 years as far as growing non-interest-bearing
deposits, retail, commercial, municipal, as well as small business [indiscernible] (00:22:51)...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And the shift has changed, right. And so, the second part of that question was about the – what's happening as
we move forward with the deposit mix?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. The mix shift into CDs, I mean it's still a bit pretty heavy, but it definitely has slowed. I would say, on the
retail side, the requests for matching other's rates has definitely slowed significantly from where it was a few
quarters ago. On the commercial side, it's still very active as you would expect with every bank [indiscernible]
(00:23:22) every other bank's customers. But I think we've done a very nice job retaining our customers and
adding others in the disruption in the marketplace.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And I know we keep mentioning this, but part of the reason I think our performance is going to show very well
relative to others, when you look at the non-interest-bearing category, in particular, because as I've said on
numerous calls, our strategy has been to focus on client primacy, to be the primary bank for our customers. The
deposit base, particularly the non-interest-bearing deposit base, is supported by compensating balances that are
paying for treasury management services and embedded balances that exist with the float and consumer and
small business accounts. So, I think our people have done a pretty good job of continuing that. And that's what's
really helping us support our non-interest-bearing deposit base.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
The other thing I would add to, I mean, as far as kind of a proof point for the mix shift happening during the
quarter, definitely slowing as we went through the quarter. If we look at the margin, the margin with – everything
that all the banks did for reporting purposes in March. From March to April, our margin went down 9 basis points
to a [ph] pre-COVID (00:24:40) level, and then we were down 3 basis points from April to May and 3 basis points
from May to June. So, clearly, there's been a slowing impact to margin statistics that also runs through the net
interest income.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
That's great color. I appreciate all that. And then, maybe changing gears here for my second question, just on
expenses. Just curious assuming we get through the year, you're at kind of the top of the guidance that implies a
quarterly run rate maybe, and just correct me if I'm wrong here, around the [ph] 2.13 (00:25.18:) mark or so. But
I'm wondering if you see any kind of opportunities to reduce expenses going forward, given the pressure on the
top line.

I mean, we've had a cost savings target every year [indiscernible] (00:25:36) fourth or fifth year of having
meaningful cost savings targets for this year [ph] $0.9 million (00:25:39). And we will see that as we go through
the year. I mean, we run – we have a 50% efficiency ratio. So, it's not like there's excess cost to take out. But we
continue every day to manage the expenses whether it's renegotiating contracts, particularly, one of the things
rolling through expenses is just inflationary impacts, contracts that have CPI clauses that have kind of kicked in
over previous quarters. We're actively going out to those vendors to look at renegotiating those contracts and get
something back for us with CPI, where it's been at times, when we've had some significant increases there.
Process improvement is a big focus in the company throughout. So, there continues to be opportunity there. So,
it's every day, Danny, that we're managing the expense side of it. We're disciplined and we're continuing to
pursue ways to kind of optimize our facilities, space optimization, which is just a constant focus. So, that's
something extra, kind of baked into what we do every day.

Operator: Our next question comes from Jared Shaw from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. This is Timur Braziler filling in for Jared. Maybe just following up on that line of commentary for
deposits with the prepared remarks of kind of mid-30s beta by year-end. I mean, that seems like a pretty
conservative number. I mean, beta increased 5-percentage point this quarter. You're assuming one more hike
here. Is there an expectation that just given how well your deposits have performed so far, that there's going to be
some element of a lag following the last rate hike? Or should we assume that kind of once the Fed is done
borrowing any kind of additional mix shift, the cost is going to kind of slow as well?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I would say, I mean, I think our teams continues to [indiscernible] (00:27:47) strategically managing deposit
costs in an especially challenging environment. The balancing act there is post failure. It's been quite an effort
throughout our company on the commercial side and the retail side with the Fed continuing to raise rates.
I think that the one more move that everybody expects to happen in February – I mean, not February, next week,
I don't think it just stops. I think there's – as I mentioned a little bit earlier, there continues to be a lot of competition
on the commercial deposit side. And we've done a great job retaining our customers for sure and retaining
deposits. But I think there's some probably carry on that happens as you go through there for some period of time.

But I mean, we – the beta at 27%, we originally guided in April to mid-20s and always a couple of points higher
than 25%, kind of use the midpoint of that. So, based on what we know now and our forecast and how we're
managing it, the mid-30s – higher than the low-30s that we kind of guesstimated, I would say, in April. But I think
that's a figure that feels reasonable to us. And if we can do better, that'll be great.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay, great. And then, maybe switching gears to the loan growth, I guess two questions. Number one, the resi
growth and Physicians First program just continues to fire on all cylinders. Resi is now approaching almost 20% of
the loan book. I guess, A, who's taking on mortgages right now? Is this purchase? Is this kind of refi activity? How
much more room is there to run in resi? And then, as we look ahead, what's kind of the mix shift or the mix of loan
growth going forward that you're expecting?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. First of all, the borrowers in the Physicians First program are some of our best credit profiles, right. So, they
– it tends to be physicians that are well established. They're upgrading their home.
Most of the business that we do is purchase money. So, the vast majority, not just Physicians First, but across our
entire footprint, has been historically skewed towards purchase money. And that's been our strategy. I would
expect as we move forward, we've kind of changed the focus a little bit, so that we're producing more saleable
product. The Physicians First loans tend to be balance sheet oriented. So, the rest of the book has been moving.
We've been moving more in the direction of producing saleable product, which should help us manage the
balance sheet. As we move forward, we'll comment about the concentrations. We're aware and capable of
adjusting. It could include sales and other avenues, but we also monitor concentrations.
But I think overall, very high quality borrowers, particularly purchase money. And the game here is to make sure
that we circle back or on the front end of origination. That's why we developed the eStore is to offer multiple
products and services to that group, particularly wealth management, brokerage, insurance, fee-based – high-
quality fee-based businesses. And then, when we look at – we end up also getting opportunities on the business
side with the practices and offering treasury management services and loan products to help facilitate the build-
out or acquisition practice...

Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And driving those over time as well. So, given the – that's pretty much our strategy with the mortgage book. I will
say, our goal has been to find originators that really do focus and are networked into the new home purchase
market versus relying on refinance activity for production. So, that's been how we've looked at it for a long time.

Yeah. I mean, 97% of the originations were purchased, so there's very little refi. But that will pick up again when
rates come down. But as we sit here today, it's virtually all purchase.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then, just last from me, maybe one Gary. We're in this period right now where everybody is expecting
some sort of credit event in the back end of this year or 2024. I guess, as you're going through your kind of
everyday review of the loan book, does anything change with this expectation for some sort of credit event? Or is
it kind of business as usual as you're reviewing those loans? Are you trying to be more proactive? I know you're
reviewing all the loans, all the CRE loans that are coming due this year and next. But is there an element of
wanting to be more proactive and maybe putting aside additional allowance kind of with this broader sentiment
out there? Or does nothing really change?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, Timur, I mean, for us, I would tell you that nothing really changes. We're very, very aggressive risk
managers and our program doesn't change from a move in the economy. So, we're going to continue to manage
the book portfolio-by-portfolio, loan-by-loan in some cases as we've talked about in the office book with the issues
going on in that space at this point. But no, no real change as far as our risk management practices are
concerned. Just continued to stay ahead of it, which is important from our perspective.

Just a couple from me on capital. Vince, I think you noted you're kind of right at your CET1 targeted ratio. Just
wondering, I would assume, including the AFS book, given the size of the bank, that's kind of less of a concern for
you guys and maybe some of the larger banks out there that might see changes in capital rules. But just
wondering about your priorities here, if we could see those – that CET1 ratio dip down a little bit through growth
11

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
and you guys were a little bit more aggressive in share buybacks than I had in my model. Just wondering how you
think about it here. Is it just more opportunistic at this point on buybacks?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I would say so, Frank. I mean, we've established that 10% as a operating target for us. We're right at
10.0%. We're not going to manage it to 10.0% every quarter. But given the strong earnings for the quarter as well
as where the stock was trading, we're opportunistic, as you mentioned, that's kind of the keyword. So, we were
opportunistic. We'll continue to be opportunistic as we go through the year.
If you look here, we have a slide we added in here looking at the CET1 ratio and TCE ratio kind of as reported
and then with the marks and I think you can see the CET1 ratio at least at March, right, we were 10.0%, 10.1% for
the peers. When you add in AFS, we're 9.3% versus 8.9%. And then, we've added AFS and HTM, we're 8.6%
versus 8.3%. So, those are all comfortable levels and better than peers. And similarly on a TCE ratio, you can –
on slide 7, you can see the impact there.
So, I mean, given the risk profile of the balance sheet, we're very comfortable with that 10%. The strong earnings
generation supported our asset growth and then that enable us to be opportunistic. We expect to kind of gradually
build CET1 in the second half of the year based on our current forecast. And we're going to put the money to
support loan growth first as we always do. And then, where there's opportunities to have the loan growth to be a
little bit slower than what's in our model, we'll be more active.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. All right. Great. And then, just – and then just a follow-up on the deposits. You mentioned the seasonality of
the muni deposit dollars. Just wondering, just for modeling purposes, if you can help with – remind us the size in
the past of those kind of flows and the expected costs may be of those relative to the rest of the book.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I mean, from peak to trough, we usually use $300 million to $500 million is kind of a normal flow from down
in the first quarter and then up through kind of the October-November timeframe. We haven't disclosed costs
specifically on those. I mean, we've talked about where we're pricing. We have some promotional CD rates that
we instituted in May that are out there, kind of 5% for 13-month CD, 4.75% for 7-month CD. And so far, it
generated about $400 million in CDs since the beginning of May, with about two-thirds of that being brand new
money to the company, and some of the municipal customers will take advantage of that too.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And in almost every [indiscernible] (00:37:35) we're the primary treasury management provider. We're not just
permitting them raise hot money with us. So, it's less likely that they'll migrate into those higher cost of products.
And if there's seasonality, particularly with ad valorem, tax collection and other activities that go on that are
seasonal, the amount of treasury management fees increase at this point in time. So, they tend to live more
demand deposits to cover the cost of that increase in operations. So, there's a lot of things going on with that
portfolio. It's not just money flowing in and out in the high yielding.

Frank Schiraldi Q

Okay. So, I guess some of that will come in as non-interest-bearing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Frank Schiraldi Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Just kind of curious if it's going to really impact that kind of non-interest-bearing trend in a big enough way for us
to kind of see it next quarter. But maybe not.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I don't think it's going to have a dramatic impact. It's hard to say, though, based upon earnings credit rates and
what type of investment rate they can get and whether the folks managing those balances at those entities decide
to use free balances or benefit from investing. So, that's all part of it. But I just wanted to make clear that we're not
just basically taking the high yield and it's not what we do. So...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
And on the bulk of the money I referenced will really come through DDA side...

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
...because they collect [indiscernible] (00:39:12) taxes, so that'll flow through the non-interest-bearing line, Frank.
Just to clarify that.

Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Hi, Mike.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I wanted to start and this question admittedly might be a quarter or so early here, but I was wondering if you could
give us a little more color on, like the incremental CD growth, the type of duration. And as you guys think about
that moving forward, at what point does that turn from kind of headwind to tailwind? And what's your experience –
kind of an uncharted territories here? But is that something you would hope, if your rate forecast proves to be
accurate, that if the environment cools off, you would be able to kind of roll some of that forward lower? Obviously
competitively, the CD rates right now are probably the most competitive. It's been in memory – recent memory.
But just curious how you guys think about that dynamic in the margin as we look ahead to next year at this point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. No, that's exactly how we think about it, Mike. So, the average term of the CD portfolio is 10 months. Right
now, the two specials that I mentioned that we have are 13 months and 7 months CDs. So, very short. The idea
being there that it's – like you said, it's very competitive now. But if rates start to come down mid-year, second half
of next year, then we have an opportunity to reprice as well or so that's exactly the strategy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. And then, just as you guys think about all the disruption in the industry, I think one of the reasons, at least
in my opinion, that you guys have weathered the storm so well is just the diversity of the franchise both line of
business, geographic. You had some really large, well-respected players that are no longer around. Just
strategically, is there anything on your roadmap that might be new or pulled forward where there's opportunities
maybe like on the private banking side or in some of these other small business, niche businesses that these
banks had large market share and that you guys are looking at that we should be mindful of as we think about
2024 and 2025 growth opportunities?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
I don't think there's a specific business line from other banks that we would be interested in. I mean, we would
have pursued that long ago. We've always said that we were different. We had been compared to those banks
that are in our relative size range, right, at least to couple of years ago. So, they were peer in our peer group.
They were benchmarked against them by analysts.
I think their model was vastly different than what we do. We've said that, over time, if you go back and look at the
old earnings call transcripts, I've said it over and over again, we tend to focus on building relationships in the
middle market, handling consumers or kind of mid-stream consumers. We do have a private banking effort. We
do have the Physicians First program, which is really focused on higher – high income consumers. But we cater
14


F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
(FNB) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
to the broad spectrum of consumer and small business. And that's really – that's been our focus. We focused on
investing in product capabilities to help us broaden the returns on capital that we deploy with consumers and
businesses. That doesn't sound like a very sexy model, but we've tried to manage risk by diversifying
geographically. We said that repeatedly.
Gary spends lots of time, his team, Tom Fisher, Gary, the whole team analyzing concentrations of risk, so that
there's granularity within the portfolio. And then, I think if you go back and look at the earnings transcripts, even
before all this happened, I said we are a very strong consumer franchise with a granular deposit base. Our
deposit mix was very favorable. And quite frankly, I think that is really paramount to the valuation of a bank. I think
if you're going to evaluate the value of a financial institution, you want to look at their deposit base. So, I think – I
don't see us really changing. I do think, with the exit, they are in our businesses as well, right. So, the exit of those
players from a competitive perspective will help us.
And then, I think from a wealth perspective, doing loans to high net worth individuals, commercial lending in
certain markets, we will be able to benefit from the disruption [indiscernible] (00:44:21).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Most opportunity is to pick up bankers too.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
...absolutely. Hiring people. We've had no issue attracting talent. So, actually, people reach out to us all the time
and that's not the way it was historically. So, I think our – staying power and conservatism really puts us in a
strong position. That's what I said in my comments, as we move through the cycle to compete more effectively.
We have liquidity, capital capacity, a great product set. And I think from a – I said it before and I'll say it again, I
think that our investment in technology, what we're focusing on for us is spot on. It's improving the ability for
clients to purchase multiple products and services through us in a very efficient way. So, we continue to focus on
the eStore. And that's why the consumer applications are up as much as they are. I think because we add
deposits in November to that platform and that's really going to help us with getting new consumers that it'll be
really easy to purchase multiple products and services and open depository account on one platform with one
application. So, that's the most exciting part, I think, as we move forward. It's using AI and the digital tools that we
put in place to make it a better experience for the clients. Anyway, that's it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Perito Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
No, that's – it's really helpful color. Thank you, guys. And then, just last question from me. I was just curious if you
were willing to maybe share or opine some thoughts about the kind of the next phase of bank M&A here. Vince, I
mean, it's pretty apparent that there's going to be some more consolidation on the heels of this event. Just curious
what you're seeing out there. It seems very slow and kind of regulatory headwinds at this current juncture. But just
also, maybe a comment on what you think that next iteration of consolidation could mean for F.N.B. from an
opportunity standpoint, if at all.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Well, I've said – I made a comment on one of the calls that I wouldn't want to be an investment banker. And
everybody is [ph] running crazy with that (00:46:39) at this point, but I'm not going to make any sarcastic
15


F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
comment. But I will say, it might be a good time in the future, right, to be an investment banker because there are
a lot of banks that are struggling for a variety of reasons. As we move through this cycle, I think when we come
out the other end, there will be things to look at. I don't think we're there yet.
I think if we were to be active in M&A and I'm not suggesting that we are, we're kind of internally focused right
now. We stick to the tried and true strategy of focusing on end market deals where we can get cost saves, that
are immediately accretive to earnings, and have very limited tangible book value dilution and returns on capital
that are well above our cost of capital. That's our – we've said that forever, that's what the board expects. But
we're very disciplined around that, and I think it shows in our performance that we've stayed true to that strategy.
I think the current M&A market is very challenging. Still, there's a lot of banks that probably would like to sell
themselves, but I don't know that the deal works from a mathematical perspective or from a financial perspective.
So, we've been focusing principally on building out our e-delivery channel, the eStore that I mentioned, and then
augmenting that channel across our seven-state footprint with the deployment of ATMs and ITMs. So, we feel that
that's a better way for us to go in very cost-effective effectively bridge our physical delivery channel with the
ATMs, branded ATMs, and then push our digital products to that customer base. And we've had some good
success doing that. So, we're going to stay focused on that de novo strategy and the deployment of ATMs and
continue to drive consumers and small businesses then. Anyway, that's my view on M&A. No sarcastic headlines.
So...

Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey, good morning, guys. I wanted to follow up on comments that Gary made earlier. It'd just be helpful if you're
able to share some of the assumptions that went into the company-wide stress test you performed this quarter.
Sounds like that's something you do this time every year. Would be interesting to just get some kind of broad
strokes around assumptions, particularly CRE price declines. Anything you guys could elaborate on.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. It's pretty much our normal stress test review. Russell, from the assumption perspective. From a result
perspective, charge-offs came in a little lower than they did the past review. And in terms of the economic
forecast, a little higher provision around the forecast. In terms of the ACL, it covered those potential losses by
16

more than 50% in a worst case nine-quarter scenario. So, just the standard review which we do on a pretty
regular basis and it came up better than we expected and better than the prior review.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
That's helpful, Gary. Thank you. And then, just switching gears for my last question here. On the securities
portfolio, just any appetite to restructure some of that? And if so, what type of earn-back you guys might be willing
to stomach?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. No, I would say, I mean, historically, we've looked at that and it's a zero sum game. So, we like the portfolio
that we have. The cash flows, it's pretty healthy level almost $900 million over the next 12 months. About 12% of
the portfolio that's rolling off at 2.41%. And today, we're reinvesting in that kind of 5.40% level. So, given the
structure of the portfolio, I think our team, Scott, has done a very nice job, creating the portfolio, so you don't have
significant extension risk or contraction risk. And with where we are today, the opportunity is there to cash flow
every month.
I mean, for the second quarter, we reinvested about two-thirds of the cash flows $135 million or so into the
portfolio. The portfolio did shrink a little until we've – some of the fund's – fund to loan growth that there. But
during the quarter, we reinvested a 5.29%. Today, it's 5.40%. Last quarter – first quarter, it was 5.10%. So, we'll
continue to opportunistically invest there.
As we look ahead, kind of the general plan will be to hold the portfolio about the same level as it was at the end of
June as we go forward. Again, being opportunistic with where we invest. So far, we've been able to put $82
million to work at 5.40%, a three-year duration. So, I think the strategy of the portfolio – it's a good sound portfolio
and I think the strategy makes a lot of sense for us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Russell E. T. Gunther Q

on the balance sheet as well.

Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I mean, as we sit here today, we still have about a $1.2 billion or what I would call excess cash. We put that
on in the March timeframe, given the market disruption that occurred. Like I said, that affected our net interest
margin statistics that went down from kind of that March to April timeframe that I talked about with the dollars of
NII, kind of proposed to a push to that. We talk about it regularly. For now, we're going to keep it $1.2 billion.
Right, Scott?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manuel Navas Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. If I jump back to loan growth for a bit, it seems like the perspective is on the consumer side, as purchase
comes down and you're doing more gain on sale business. The consumer growth might decline a bit across the
back half of the year. Also on seasonality, just kind of what are the trends there on an outlook? And then, what
are you seeing right now commercially?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I think you nailed it on the mortgage book. I mean, we're expecting it to tail off a little bit towards the end of
the year. But I do think, commercial is up. The pipelines are up about 12% across the board. Good activity in the
Carolinas, a little slower than previous years, but still good solid activity. And this is where our geographic
diversification really helps us, right, because I think the mid-Atlantic has slowed, D.C. and Baltimore is a little
slower. Pittsburgh is still – Pittsburgh is just chugging along, Cleveland and Pittsburgh. And then the South is still
experiencing – we're experiencing elevated pipelines. But like I said, I think it's a little slower than it has been in
the past. It's substantial enough to provide us the opportunities to hit our guide. And that's why we reaffirmed our
guide for the year. So, as we – we're halfway through here, so we're feeling a little better right about where we're
going to end up, Vince?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Mid-single digit, yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
So, anyway, that's the kind of the look. I think, from a C&I perspective, there's probably a little more activity on the
C&I side. Obviously, CRE is a little slower. Yet, we're not a player in the large office space, urban large office.
We're not really a player there. So, what we're seeing is a little different than others may have faced. But that's
where we are.

Yeah, I don't have statistics at hand to share with you. That portfolio continues to grow. It was north of $750
million in total. I don't have the exact number in front of me, but...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, it's around like a $1.5 billion of Physicians First mortgage.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. That's globally, I'm referencing what we originated in our program versus what we hold on our balance
sheet. But we hold on our balance sheet larger throughout.

[indiscernible] (00:56:20) in the mortgage rate, not just physicians and the Physicians First program. So, the total
portfolio would be $1.5 billion originated through our specific program would be about $750 million to $800 million.
But I think the – again, I think we're going to be focusing as we move forward on more saleable product. So, we
should be able to bring balances down. And those customers have – we've really just started to scratch the
surface in terms of how we go after cross-sell opportunity. So, I don't have good statistics for you.

Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
We're very early on. Particularly with the aggregation of those products in the eStore. And come November, when
we add the depository products, what's going to happen is when somebody originates a mortgage loan, even
through the Physicians First program, they're going to be able to purchase the insurance and depository and other
consumer loans products on the same platform or at one time with one application. Insurance isn't going to come
in for a little later, but deposits and loans will be there end-to-end by November.

Yeah. For physicians loans made this year, I mean, we're talking about 90% plus have multiple products out the
door with us. And so...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manuel Navas Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
That's great. And I guess my last question is as we see NII and given your rate assumptions that can change very
quickly, but given NII and NIM guidance, do we think that NII could bottom out like early next year? What are kind
of thoughts around that, given that this is a little bit of a hypothetical for next year?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I would say, I mean, the margin and NII really bottom to kind of fourth to first quarter kind of based on our
current forecast and what we're thinking. And then, we'll start to build there. Obviously, the earning asset growth
that we have right is a key factor in there and helping to [indiscernible] (00:58:37). But I would say, over the kind
of that fourth and first is based on what we see today, like you said, it can change quickly. So, that's kind of...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manuel Navas Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Definitely.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A

Operator: And our next question comes from Brian Martin from Janney Montgomery. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott
Hey, good morning, guys. Most of my stuff was just answered there with the loans and the margin. But just one
more on the margin, Vince. I guess there's – the pace of [indiscernible] (00:59:12) funding cost pressure is flowing
slowing, so that the rate impact of going forward to the margin should be less and less. So, if you are troughing in
fourth quarter, first quarter, then the rate of decline in the margin should be maybe a bit more this quarter, maybe
a bit less in the fourth quarter and kind of tailing off? Is that how to think about it given your outlook on rates?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I would say, I mean, I mentioned the 3 basis points a month the last couple of months. So, what's baked
into our guidance would probably be in that, I don't know, three months to four months as we go forward. Really
much slower pace than the 19 basis points that it was down first and second quarter. So, that's what's baked into
our guidance. And then bottoming in that kind of fourth and first, Brian, and then starting to – slowly build from
there.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Vincent J. Delie, Jr. A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Got you. Okay. And then, just on the – on the liquidity part and just deposit growth in general, I know you talked
about maybe the non-interest-bearing being a bit lower, but just as far as the contraction and you talked about the
seasonality this quarter and deposits, what's your outlook on deposits here? I mean, if you maintain that liquidity,
is your expectation that those deposits with seasonality grow a bit this quarter? I know you kind of give the
guidance for the full year, but just thinking about deposits in aggregate, not just the non-interest-bearing bucket.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah. I mean, what we commented on is kind of flat from June to the end of the year, just given the municipal
deposits, what the flow through there. And I think our – if you look at our data, I mean, all the peers aren't out yet
for our deposit decreases versus the HA data I think show very well. And I think the non-interest-bearing changes
from some of the stuff I've read is, is at the better end of things for sure in the prior quarter compared to those that
are out so far. So...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott
Yeah. Okay. And then just – just on an outlook on the liquidity, when you actually maybe look at using that to fund
the loan growth as opposed to just holding it for a bit. What's kind of the outlook on that liquidity?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, really, just for now, I mean, we're going to hold it, Brian, where it is. I mean, we're earning 5.15% on it,
right, Scott.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
For 25 basis points.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott
That's right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
So, it's really not costing us to keep it. And just given the environment, we don't have a set date. I asked that all
the time. We're going to start to deploy it, but for now, we're going to maintain that $1.2 billion and like I said, it's
from an NII standpoint, it's just not hurting us.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 20-Jul-2023
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott
Yeah. Got it. Okay. And maybe just the last two was, it sounds like with the loan growth, the pipelines are up a bit,
but still kind of maybe tepid on the commercial side. The buyback, I guess, is that something – I guess this current
level of type of repurchases could continue for the near term if you're – the earnings are there and you're willing to
take the capital maybe a bit lower, if you've got the conservative credit quality at after the stress test? Is that fair
how to think about the buyback going forward, certainly expecting us to be opportunistic?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vincent J. Calabrese, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Yeah, I think that's the key word. It's really opportunistic. And if the loan grows a little slower than what's in our
forecast, we think we could become more active. From a capacity standpoint, we still have plenty under our
authorization. The $40 million of capacity authorized and still could be used, Brian. So, we'll continue to be
opportunistic. And we manage that. We will align it with shareholder interests and we'll continue to do that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott
Yeah, okay. And then – and maybe just the last one, I think, Gary, you mentioned last quarter that you might –
after you've done the stress test that you might think about doing – making some sales on selective sales on the
office side. I guess any update on that, as you kind of gone through things? Any changes to your outlook there
still potential that may occur?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary L. Guerrieri A
Chief Credit Officer, F.N.B. Corp. (Pennsylvania)
Frank, we don't have anything in our queue at the moment. So, really, really nothing that is teed up for a later year
sale. It's always part of our quiver that we have to take action. So, we'll continue to look at that as we move
through the year, and see if anything needs to be put into that category here before the end of the year, but
nothing right now.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Joseph Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott
Got you. Okay. Perfect. I appreciate the update. Thanks for taking the questions.
