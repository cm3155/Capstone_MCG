President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Tamara. Welcome and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call as we review
our third quarter results, which we released before the market opened this morning. The earnings release and
investor presentation are available at columbiabank.com.
We saw momentum continue to rebuild in the third quarter as evidenced by the growth in deposits, core earnings,
and our loan pipeline. From the onset of the pandemic, our bankers have remained externally focused with the
mindset that the current environment could be with us well into 2021. The team continues to be creative,
implementing new real-time solutions for our clients and our employees, such as our highly successful Pass It On
campaign, quickly standing up to PPP loan and forgiveness portals, or providing resources for parents who are
juggling work and distance learning for their children.
Out-of-the-box thinking is valuable in a time like this and our team's ingenuity is paying dividends. In the midst of it
all, we opened our newest NeighborHub in Boise, expanding our commitment to Southern Idaho.
On the call with me today are Aaron Deer, our Chief Financial Officer; Chris Merrywell, our Chief Operating
Officer; and Andy McDonald, our Chief Credit Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we will be happy to
answer your questions. Let me remind you that we may make forward-looking statements during the call. For

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Clint. First quarter earnings of $44.7 million and EPS of $0.63 were an increase of $8.2 million and
$0.11, respectively, on a linked-quarter basis. Quarterly pre-tax preprovision earnings of $62.1 million were down
$16.2 million due to the non-recurring second quarter gain on sale of a portion of our Visa Class B restricted stock
and subsequent write-up of the remaining shares that contributed $16.4 million to that quarter.
Total deposits ended the quarter at $13.6 billion, up $469 million from June 30. This supported a further reduction
in FHLB borrowings and an increase in earning assets, which together drove net interest income up by $2.9
million when compared to the second quarter. Excess liquidities from the deposit inflows was mostly invested in
lower-yielding mortgage-backed securities combined with lower loan yields and other factors resulted in a 17-
basis-point drop in the net interest margin to 3.47%. Of note, PPP loans weighed on the margin by about 9 basis
points.
Given the rate environment and outlook, we anticipate rate pressure to continue, but we have taken measures to
mitigate this pressure, including targeted adjustments to our deposit pricing, purchases of agency securities with
reduced prepayment risks, and adding floors to new loan production. Our industry-leading cost of deposits
dropped by 1 basis point to 6 basis points. I'll also note that just last week we terminated our $500 million notional
value interest rate collar, effectively locking in a gain on that collar to benefit the margin through February 2024.
Total loans ended the quarter at $9.7 billion, down $83 million from June 30. Loan production was ripe for third
quarter at $279 million, however, production volumes increased sequentially throughout the quarter.
Excluding PPP, new loan production was brought on at an average tax adjusted coupon rate of 3.86%, which
compares to the overall portfolio of 4.14%. Non-interest income of $22.5 million was a decrease of $14.8 million.
After factoring out the onetime gains of $16.4 million on the Visa Class B restricted stock and $875,000 from the
disposal of loans in the second quarter, non-interest income was actually up $2.5 million or 13%. Increased
transaction volume from the relaxation of shelter-in-place orders drove card revenues and deposit service fees up
by $755,000 and $566,000, respectively, and loan revenue increased by $1 million, mostly from new mortgage
loans originated and sold.
Non-interest expense was $85.1 million in the third quarter, which was an increase of $4.3 million on a linked-
quarter basis. Compensation and benefits expense increased by $9.1 million, principally due to the deferral of
loan origination costs related to the PPP loan program in the second quarter. This was offset by a $2 million
reduction in the provision for unfunded loan commitment, included in other non-interest expense. Much of the
remaining $2.8 million non-interest expense variance was due to systems, legal and professional, and other
various costs incurred in the second quarter to set up the PPP program and respond to the pandemic.
Our non-interest expense ratio remained at 2.13% for the quarter and our operating rate efficiency ratio increased
about 1 point to 56%. We expect our quarterly non-interest expense run rate to remain in the mid-80s for the
fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.2% and should remain in the 18% to 19% range for
the full year.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Aaron; and good morning, everyone. Our production teams have been actively engaged across our
footprint, securing new business and partnering with our clients to ensure they have what they need to run their
businesses. In addition, our operations teams have been diligent and creative with finding solutions to support our
relationship bankers and bringing the organization to the clients when needed, while still complying with
regulations and maintaining physical distance in the midst of both COVID and the unusual fire season in our
footprint over the past months.
Additionally, our team members have stepped into support each other when time was needed to assist with
COVID issues, evacuations, and heavy smoke. We are very proud of our excellent team of bankers and feel this
continues to set us apart.
The highlight of the quarter was continued strong deposit growth, largely stemming from a combination of new
client relationships, economic stimulus, and reduced spending by businesses and consumers. Coming off a
record second quarter, deposits grew by another $469 million during the third quarter, with growth evenly split
between existing and new accounts.
The deposit mix shifted from 59% business and 41% consumer as of June 30 to 62% business and 38%
consumer at September 30. The increase in business deposits is attributed to normal seasonality. On the
consumer side, account balances were essentially flat as we saw an increase in debit card transactions as
COVID restrictions were relaxed and consumers resumed more normal spending habits. From a product
perspective, deposits as of September 30 were 51% demand and other non-interest-bearing and 49% interest-
bearing.
Our bankers have been busy rebuilding the pipeline amidst the pandemic and we generated new loan production
as mentioned, of $279 million during the quarter, which included $9 million of additional PPP loans brought on in
early July. Most of the new production was in C&I and CRE followed by 1-4 family, Ag, and construction loans.
Loans overall decreased by $83 million during the quarter to $9.7 billion. New originations were offset by net
payments on existing loans of $84 million, payoffs of $66 million, and a reduction in line utilization of $33 million.
The remaining decline was mostly due to loan prepayments.
Our line utilization rate declined from 47.5% at the end of the second quarter to 46.8%, driven by declines in
construction, followed by consumer, and C&I. PPP loans gross of deferred fees were $970 million at quarter end,
representing 10% of total loans. That should decline from here as we opened our forgiveness portal in mid-August
and began receiving forgiveness statements from the FCA in early October.
Excluding the PPP loans, the quarter production mix was 45% fixed, 42% floating, and 13% variable. The overall
portfolio mix is now 10% PPP loans, 45% non-PPP fixed, 31% floating, and 14% variable. Residential mortgage
activity accelerated in the third quarter, driving non-interest loan revenue higher by $1 million on a linked-quarter
basis. This has been a bright spot given the lower interest rate environment. As a reminder, Columbia Bank
originates and generally sells its conventional production and portfolios to jumbos.
Deposit service charges and card revenues increased by a combined $1.3 million from a return to normalized
transaction activity levels after the second quarter low caused by state, government-mandated shelter-in-place
orders. We are continually optimizing our delivery strategy and have been proactive in consolidating branches

over the past several years, expanding each branch of service coverage area given local market conditions and
projected growth.
In the past five years, we have consolidated 20 branches, representing approximately 12% of our network, with
13 of those in the past three years. As part of our ongoing branch rationalization process, we announced the
consolidation of two branches in the fourth quarter, one in our coastal region, consolidated this past weekend and
the other in our Puget Sound region will occur in the next two weeks.
As Clint indicated, we also opened our newest NeighborHub style branch in Boise at the end of September, which
has been well received by the community.
Now I will turn the call over to Andy to review our credit performance.

Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thanks, Chris. The provision under CECL of $7.4 million reflects a strong Q3 rebound, negated by increased
uncertainty going into 2021. Consistent with my comments last quarter, the momentum and path of the recovery
will continue to be threatened by the coronavirus pandemic. In general, our forecast anticipates a second
contraction in 2021, attributed to uncertain consumer reactions to rising case counts within the United States as
we head into winter.
Certainly, the events that are currently unfolding in Europe, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain and what, if any,
future government stimulus may look like will impact this. Therefore, our modeling continues to reflect a more
protracted recovery with slower GDP growth and an unemployment rate that remains elevated in 2021. As a
reminder, we use IHS Markit for our economic forecast.
Annualized gross domestic product is anticipated to decline in the fourth quarter of 2020 by 6.3%, followed by a
rebound in the fourth quarter of 2021 where GDP grows 4.6% as the economy begins to slowly exit the pandemic.
While the unemployment rate has retreated from its high in Q2, we anticipate ending 2021 at close to 11% due to
the lasting effects of the coronavirus.
We also added an overlay to this quarter for what we consider high-risk commercial real estate, basically,
hospitality, office, and retail and downstream potential impacts of permanent job losses at a significant Northwest
employer. These amounted to a combined $5 million in additional reserves for the quarter. We ended the quarter
with a provision relative to period-end loans of 1.62%; adjusting for the PPP loans, the allowance period in loans
increases to 1.8%.
NPAs for the quarter were relatively unchanged at 29 basis points. However, I feel adjusting for PPP loans
provides a more consistent comparison as we move forward into 2021. With this adjustment, NPAs do increase,
but only by 2 basis points, so again, relatively unchanged. I would like to remind folks, NPAs are still comprised of
credits whose issues predate the pandemic.
Past due loans for the quarter were 15 basis points, compared to 21 basis points last quarter. Net charge-offs
annualized were 8 basis points for the quarter versus 16 basis points last quarter and our impaired capital ratio
rose modestly from 23.5% to 25.3%. So as alluded to earlier, your standard credit metrics for the quarter were
relatively stable.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2020
On the risk rating front, loans rated watch or below was unchanged at just around $1.085 billion. We saw watch
loans increase $7 million going from $386 million to $393 million. Special mention loans declined $32 million to
$355 million and substandard loans saw an increase of $23 million and are now around $336 million in total.
These changes increased our watch and below risk ratings from 11% to 11.1% of total loans, again, very stable
metrics.
Okay, let's move on to deferrals. At the beginning of the quarter, we had close to $1.6 billion in active loan
deferrals. At the close of the quarter, we had $114 million in active deferrals. Most of the deferrals today are in the
hospitality portfolio, which accounts for $62 million of the active deferrals. Approximately two-thirds of this amount
represents loans in their second deferral period. As mentioned before, this is consistent with our strategy relative
to the sector and does not cause us to be any more concerned than we were when we entered the first deferral
with these borrowers.
At the end of the quarter, the portfolios we had identified as being some of the first to be impacted by the
pandemic, which includes our hotel, retail, restaurants, aviation, and dental and healthcare portfolios amounted to
a little over $2.4 billion, or roughly 25% of our loan portfolio. If we exclude the dental and healthcare portfolios,
which we are feeling much better about these days, it falls to about $1.3 billion, or 13% of our loan portfolio.
The largest portfolio we identified again was our dental portfolio. As previously discussed, we believe the impact
on this portfolio is and was truly transitory. Today, these practices are generating revenue at around 82% to 85%
of pre-pandemic levels. At this level of revenue generation, most of these practices are operating above
breakeven. This is further evidenced by deferrals in this portfolio declining from 78.6% of the portfolio to less than
1% of the total portfolio during the quarter. Again, a combination of deferrals and PPP loans are allowing these
practices to move forward with little impact on the bank's balance sheet. Similar to last quarter, 95% of the
portfolio is rated pass, 4% watch, and the remaining 1% is evenly split between special mention and substandard.
The next largest segment we identified as having a higher risk relative to the economic disruption caused by
COVID-19 is our retail portfolio. We have approximately $568 million in retail-related exposure, which is
essentially unchanged from the prior quarter. It's split between commercial real estate and commercial business
loans, and represents about 5.8% of the total loan portfolio. The largest part of our retail exposure is comprised of
commercial real estate loans, which account for approximately $441 million of the total. It is evenly split between
Washington and Oregon, and as you would expect, centered within the Portland and Seattle MSA. The average
loan size is $427,000.
To give you an idea of the types of retail properties we finance, the most common are small four to five-day strip
centers located in suburban communities. We also do a fair amount of standalone single-tenant properties, which
would be characterized as auto park companies, home and garden/building retailers, as well as food and
beverage stores, also called convenience stores, along with gas stations, sporting goods, and furniture stores. In
addition, the portfolio contains grocery-anchored centers and mixed use properties. We are not in large downtown
core metropolitan areas, nor do we finance regional malls.
Using at origination values, the average loan-to-value for the portfolio is 52%, with 97% of the portfolio having a
loan-to-value less than 75%. We have stress-tested this portfolio for an equivalent decline in value as seen during
the Great Recession. The average loan-to-value rises to 64% with about 72% of the properties having a loan-to-
value less than 75%.

For the entire retail portfolio, 89.7% is pass rated, which is a slight improvement over last quarter, when 86% was
pass rated. For the balance of the portfolio at quarter end, 5% is watch, 4% is special mention, and 2% is
substandard. This breakdown is essentially unchanged from the first quarter.
Deferrals in this portfolio declined from 16.4% of the entire portfolio to less than 1% of the portfolio. Obviously, we
are pleased with how this portfolio is performing, but we remain cautious and our expectation is that we would see
weakening in this portfolio as PPP funds become exhausted and deferral benefits subside. This segment would
greatly benefit by another round of stimulus, in my opinion.
Okay, let's discuss hotels. We have $335 million in hotel loans, representing about 3.4% of our loan portfolio.
About 38% is in major markets, which would include the Portland and Seattle MSAs. However, we also have
about 16% of the hotel portfolio or $55 million of exposure out on the Oregon Coast. To give you an idea of the
type of hotels we finance, most have one of the following flags: Holiday Inn, Best Western, Choice, Marriott and
Wyndham. In total, flag properties comprise 84% of the portfolio. The average loan size is $1.5 million. Today, we
have about $62 million on deferral, which is down from last quarter when approximately $179 million was on
deferral. Many of the loans on deferral today are on their second deferral, which is consistent, as I mentioned
before, with our strategy for this portfolio.
We anticipate the recovery in the hotel sector to be prolonged. With this in mind, we are working on a number of
options for our clients, which include USDA programs, the main street lending program, along with more
conventional solutions as well. Many of these plans were crafted in concert with our borrowers during the first
deferral period. We are now using the second deferral period to effectuate upon these strategies.
Similar to the retail commercial real estate loans, we continue to do stress-testing on this portfolio as well. The
average loan-to-value for the portfolio based on originated appraised value is 52%, with 95% of the portfolio
having a loan-to-value of less than 75%. On a stress basis, about 69% of the portfolio has a loan-to-value less
than 75%.
Non-dental healthcare is about $299 million in total. Similar to the dental portfolio, we saw the impacts of the
pandemic here to be transitory as well, as individuals are once again able to see their orthopedist, dermatologist,
optometrist and so on. In addition, elective surgeries, such as hip replacements, knee replacements, cataracts are
again being performed along with blood test, MRI, sonograms, and EKGs.
The breakout of the portfolio is as follows: approximately $95 million is veterinary. Another $152 million are
physician practices of varying kind and $53 million is other types of healthcare providers, such as chiropractors,
physical therapists, and counseling services. The average loan size is $317,000.
As of June 30, 98% of the portfolio is pass rated with 1% on watch and 1% rated substandard. We had deferral
requests for about $107 million in total in this segment or roughly 36% of the portfolio as of June 30. Today, we
have $381,000 on deferral or less than 1% of the portfolio. As I mentioned earlier, we're feeling good about this
portfolio.
Okay, restaurants and food services. We have approximately $211 million in this portfolio with two-thirds
comprising commercial real estate loans. The average loan size is $269,000. Today, 86% is pass rated, 5%
watch, 3% special mention, and the balance is substandard. We granted 157 deferrals for about $66 million in this
portfolio, but today, we have 16 on deferral or roughly $16 million.

Similar to the hotel and retail segments, we see this area taking some time to heal. And while we are pleased with
the performance of the portfolio, we remain cautious here as well. Outside dining and such had a significant
impact for many of these businesses, but the colder months ahead will make it difficult for these revenue-
generating options to remain viable. As such, we anticipate additional stress in this segment in the months to
come. We do stress-testing on the CRE portion of this portfolio and on a pre-pandemic basis, the average loan-to-
value was 58% with 93% having a loan-to-value less than 75%, again, on a pre-pandemic basis. Under our
stress-test scenario, average loan-to-value rises to 72% with only 54% having a loan-to-value of less than 75%.
Again, the last portfolio I'm going to discuss is our aviation portfolio. It is comprised of both direct exposure to
domestic airline carriers, as well as entities of leasing airplanes and engines to airline carriers. In total, the
portfolio is about $142 million with $98 million being direct exposure to US domestic airline and the remaining $44
million in exposure to lessors.
Today, most of the portfolio is rated watch, which is an improvement over last quarter. Most of the upgrades have
been centered in the domestic airlines segment, thanks to the significant amount of capital our borrowers have
raised year-to-date. Of the domestic airlines we have exposure to, they have raised over $43 billion in additional
capital to assist them through this pandemic.
Just this past quarter, they raised an additional $10 billion and have secured agreements with the US Treasury for
additional funding if needed. As such, this additional capital combined with expense reduction efforts results in all
of our borrowers having over 24 months of burn rate now. This increase in burn rate was the primary driver for the
upgrade from special mention to watch as it gives the airlines two years to adjust their business models relative to
the impact that pandemic has placed on them.
Most of our domestic airline exposure is secured by aircraft with a pre-stress loan to value of 70% and a current
loan-to-value we believe closer to 74%. On a stress test basis, the loan-to-value rises to 89%. As for the leasing
portfolio, 49% of the exposure is in Asia, 23% Europe, and 9% North America. The majority of the portfolio
consists of narrow-body aircraft with an average age of 6.8 years. We view the younger, more fuel-efficient
aircraft as being the most in demand post-pandemic.
Based on origination values, our average loan-to-value for the portfolio is 77%. However, based on what we
believe is today's value, the loan-to-value is closer to 83%. And on a stress test basis, the loan-to-value rises to
97%.
Okay. With that, back to Clint.

Thanks, Andy. Given our strong earnings stream and total capital of 14.2%, yesterday, our board of directors
approved a new share repurchase program for up to 3.5 million shares. In addition to share repurchases, we have
a full menu of options for deploying excess capital, including further investment in our business, special dividends,
and should the right opportunity arise strategic M&A. We announced our regular quarterly dividend of $0.28 this
morning. This quarter's dividend will be paid on November 25 to shareholders of record as of the close of
business on November 11. This concludes our prepared comments.
As a reminder, Andy, Chris, and Aaron are with me to answer your questions. And now, Tamara, we will open the

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] . Okay, via the phone line, you have a response on the line of David Feaster.
Please go ahead.

David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, everybody.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hi, David.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
I just wanted to get a sense of the competitive dynamics and thoughts on loan growth. Originations are down a
bit. Just curious your appetite for new loans, the competitive landscape, the pulse of your clients, and maybe just
how your pipeline is trending, and just any thoughts you might have going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
I'll start, and then I'll turn it over to Chris to fill in some gaps. And both Chris and I have traveled extensively
throughout our footprint, met with bankers and our clients. And Andy has as well. And every time we come back
much more optimistic. We see the things that are going on, the opportunities that our bankers are getting a look
at. There is some disruption that's occurring within our market with some of the things that some of the large
national banks are doing, and that's creating opportunities for us as well.
I think from a production standpoint, we saw – in terms of what it was down, it was on a percentage basis, pretty
similar to what we experienced in the second quarter, but what we've seen with the pipelines is consistent in
terms of the rebuilding there with the things that I just mentioned that our bankers are getting a look at. And so it
gives us a lot of optimism. It's still a tough and very competitive environment. The yield curve is definitely
unfavorable and things of that nature.
But the team of Chris, Aaron, and Andy are working very hard with all of their folks on making sure that we're
capturing new business that we're deepening the relationships that we have and that more importantly that we're
finding a home for all of that liquidity that has found its way to our balance sheet in the last six months.
And with that, I'll step back and let Chris provide his perspective.

Chris Merrywell A
Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thanks, Clint; and good morning, David. Yeah, I would say that to echo Clint's comments that the pipeline is
moving in the right direction. We are, I would say, cautiously optimistic with everything that Andy talked about and
what potentially is down the road, we have to be very cautious in looking at credits and what we can – we're

comfortable bringing on. But the good news is, with all of that considered in the extra time it takes at a COVID
overlay and say we're cautiously optimistic, and it is moving in the right direction.
The environment in and of itself, you can see the new loan yields and what they come on at, I expect that to
probably continue with the yield curve where it's at and just the environment in general with excess liquidity. New
loan volume is paramount for everybody. And I think we're winning our fair share and again, cautiously optimistic
as we move forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then I know you've only got two out there and one we've just implemented. But how do
you think about the performance of these NeighborHubs and what's your plans for growth of this concept going
forward? Is this a good way for organic market expansion and kind of beta test the market to potentially backfill
with lift-outs or M&A and just capitalize on some of this disruption that you're talking about or just how do you plan
to use this concept going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Merrywell A
Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks for the question. The concept in and of itself, we're talking about branches that are less than
typically 1,800 square feet, different concept within it. It's not built around transactions first. It's built more around
solutions and consultation and sharing some of the digital options that are out there and available. The two have
been well received in the areas that they are. It certainly is a lot easier to go into a new market at 1,800 square
feet than what you would have seen in a traditional manner years ago.
And we'll continue to look at that for where the concept fits. The community rooms and things of that nature to
draw people into that space, you do need some population centers and all of that. But I think the best thing about
them is we're using the concept to then how do we use that to get into our traditional branch network where
maybe we have a 3,000, 4,000 square foot branch and how can we downsize it, how can we do other things
using the same model.
We have a few of those out there that are being piloted right now. And we're pleased with the results. I wouldn't
say that we're rushing out to put a bunch of brand-new branches into areas, but we're certainly looking at it as
part of the strategy where we can support our commercial teams and our other relationship bankers where they
are having great success driving loan volume and what will really take them to the next level is full commitment of
regional branching.

And I'll just add on to that, that with the first NeighborHub that we opened a little over two years ago and then with
the one in Boise, they're learning labs and that's really what Chris was getting at is how can we take some of the
technology, their staffing model is different. And how can we learn from that and apply that to our existing
network. And so even though the physical facility may not change, we can drive some efficiencies through
learnings from these NeighborHubs.
And I think that's probably our greatest opportunity over the next two to four years on our – with our retail banking
group is applying that across the entire network. The actual changing of the physical footprint of the branch is it's
much more complex, especially if it's leased. So there's a lot of different, I guess, dynamics at play here, but I

think it's much more than just having a concept that's in certain markets. I think the bigger potential is what we do
with the learnings from that.

David P. Feaster Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And just following up on that, we talked in the past. Cost savings is really just a part of your
DNA. It sounds like this might play into that. Just wanted to get your thoughts on expenses and how this concept,
potentially downsizing some branches and using other various initiatives that you might have to combat the
revenue headwinds and inflationary pressures, and how do you think about expenses going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
We're all looking at each other because that question was a pretty dynamic one, and it touches many different
aspects. And in terms of – we'll let Aaron here in a minute talk about what he's thinking for the run rate. But I think
that kind of building on on our response to the last question, really people and occupancy are our two largest line
items. And when we think about the NeighborHub and how it's staffed versus a traditional regional branch model
where a lot of the activities there are paying and receiving, the NeighborHub staffing concept is really geared
towards sales and consulting.
And we think that with the digital tools that we have available today and the things that we've invested in and the
things that will come down through our pipeline in the next 6 to 18 months as well as the acceleration that's
occurred as a result of COVID and stay-in-place orders, we think that will help accelerate that transition from that
paying and receiving function to the sales and consulting functions.
So you have fewer people that are better able to, I guess, do a wider variety of things and that equals less
downtime, if that makes sense. And that's where I think that the real opportunity lies in terms of just from the
staffing standpoint.
The technology piece, and this is what Chris alluded to earlier, we're piloting and some of our higher volume
branch locations is – it works great and a de novo branch that's building its customer base. If we add thousands
and thousands of transactions, daily transactions onto that process break. And that's what we're testing now and
challenging our folks to do and how do we take that technology and simple things like dual custody and there are
some things we've done with the NeighborHub that have given us some efficiencies there.
Actually, given social distancing requirements in our branches, it's been great to know that we have a different
process where you don't have to have two people counting money, two feet apart from one another.
Chris, did I – I'm sure I missed a lot in that response.

Chris Merrywell A

I think you captured it pretty well. And David, I think you captured it pretty well in the beginning when you said it's
part of our DNA. And it's consistently something that we're looking at and evaluating all the time. And that's why
you've seen the progress over the years. And it may be [indiscernible] (00:40:42) as we evaluate. It's not a big
rash decision or anything like that. It's part of our ongoing strategy around our values and what we bring to the
table for our clients by being there for them.

And the NeighborHub and the concept within it is equipping our bankers to be more outbound. And turning that
from – because those are de novos, there are obviously as not as many transactions that are walking in the door.
So how are they turning that and being more outbound into reaching out to clients, sharing with them all the things
we do, you've seen the results in the mortgage group right now because of the rate environment. We're reaching
out clients, making sure that they know we do do mortgages. Our financial services and trust departments and
many of the other things, we're much more proactive in that aspect. And I think that's where you look down the
road to what can we accomplish in those areas to help offset some of the stuff that we've already done, but also
that we will continue to do.
And I'll let Aaron add anything else on run rate and such.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yes. Hopefully, we continue to see the provision for unfunded commitments in the drift down in the right direction.
Heading into the fourth quarter, and I could see some project costs that might tick up a little bit, and there's always
kind of some year-end true-ups and things. But we're still feeling pretty good about that mid-80s run rate, even if it
might tick up [indiscernible] (00:42:12) this quarter.
And then, heading into next year, we'll probably look to give some guidance on that next quarter. But I think what
you're going to continue to see is just as we continue to find ways to streamline certain areas, we'll look to redirect
those resources in some more revenue-generating areas and try to increase our overall productivity over time.

Great. You talk a little bit about the approach on reserves. It seems like you've built in quite a bit of conservatism
in with the worsening 2021 and some of the overlays that you've put in. Maybe, Andy, for you, what would need to
happen to drive the need for more reserves, it feels like you're adequately reserved at this point, but what would
need to materially change for those reserve levels have to go up again?

Andrew L. McDonald A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well, I think that the biggest wildcard is the pandemic still. And if our footprint goes back into a situation where
businesses get shut down, I think there are places across the country like El Paso, for example, and then you look
at what's occurring in Europe, there are chunks in the portfolio that I alluded to that seem to have weathered the
first storm. But to weather another storm back-to-back would be very difficult. So that's probably the biggest
wildcard is how the pandemic continues to evolve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, but it seems like you've built in some of that thinking into the overlay that you put in place, is that fair?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew L. McDonald A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, we believe that the model itself still relies to a certain degree on historic numbers. You got to go a long way
back where we had losses. And so your loss given default, we have some concerns there for some particular
segments that I outlined. And then, of course, the announcement of the 787 Dreamliner leaving the Pacific
Northwest and going to South Carolina while we don't have necessarily a lot of direct exposure to Boeing, it will
have a community ripple. And we believe it's prudent for us to acknowledge that and somehow add that into our
reserve. And that is so unique and specific to a particular part of our footprint, it's not going to be captured in sort
of national GDP and unemployment numbers.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Okay. Fair enough. And then I want to touch on the margin and some of your expectations because you
clearly called it out in the release again, Aaron. But can you talk a little bit about the decision to terminate the
collar, some of the steps you can take to offset some of the pressure? And I guess the big picture is, do you feel
like the way you're set up now that you can continue to grow with net interest income from here? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hey, Jon, it's Aaron. With respect to the collar, I think that just reflects our expectation that the benefit that could
be had there was in terms of down rate risk is kind of washed out. We'd really have to see rates go negative to
yield any additional benefit there. Whereas if we do see rates move higher, the gain in that would have
diminished. So it just felt like the right time to lock that in. And I would note, just to be clear that that is a – the
benefit of that has been in the run rate and will then remain in the run rate as a result of having locked that in. So
you're not going to see an additional benefit from that. It is in the existing run rate.
In terms of the margin expectations in general, I would obviously like to have a more optimistic view, but it's given
where rates are and the shape of the yield curve right now, I think, we're likely to continue to see some pressure
there at least on a core basis. Now if you look back over the past couple of quarters, we are effectively down and
I'm just going to use round numbers, but down, say, 55 basis points. 20 of that is excess liquidity. We've got 15
from the securities portfolio, another 15 on over loan yields. PPP is 10 basis points and we've got some offsetting
benefit on the funding side. That's probably 5 basis points.
The liquidity and the PPP should go away over time, right? But as you're getting those funds redeployed into
higher yielding assets or pulling it out of Fed funds or turning in and getting that into securities and loans, at this
13

point, most of it is going into the securities portfolio. And you're still looking at sub 1%. And so it's – you're picking
something up there, but it's not as though you're going to be getting it back to the kind of yield that you'd be
getting if we're driving that into loans or if we were in a better rate environment.
So there's going to be some volatility in it, as the PPP stuff pays down both from having the lower-yielding aspect
of that go away, but also realizing the fees on that. And just to give you a sense of where we are there, we've got
about $17 million of unearned income on those PPP loans that will be either amortizing in or being recognized as
the loans are forgiven. And so that's all going to add some volatility, especially over the next probably two, three
quarters as those forgiveness – the bulk of that gets forgiven presumably. So there's a lot of noise, but I think
underlying it all is going to be some continued pressure on the core margin.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And the dollar, I guess, the dollar amount, net interest income, feels like you've got some liquidity to deploy as
well, but do you feel you can defend the NII level.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
That is our objective. And I think that given the confidence that I think you heard Chris talking about in terms of
some building pipelines and what's happening on that front that we should be able to see better loan growth and
that should be able to help us hit that target.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yes, I'll just add, as Aaron went through the items that impact the margin and all the variables that are included in
that, it makes it a challenge to zero in on and tell you that we expect 3 basis points of expansion, or contraction,
or anything of that nature. And so as we have conversations internally at our ALCO and with our key line of
business leaders, our conversations are really centered around net interest income and what those targets look
like and what the opportunities for expanding net interest income are. And I think that's the bright spot.
As Aaron mentioned, we're getting 10 basis points on overnight funds as we move those into, even if it is the
securities book, there's a pickup in NII. So that's very much our focus, given the current rate environment and the
current amount of liquidity that we have.

Thanks. Good morning.

Clint E. Stein A

Hello, Jeff.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Just a follow-on. Perhaps, it strikes me as a bigger question maybe for the industry, too, is just the liquidity in the
system. And in your discussions, Clint, you touched on it a bit. I'm maybe interested in the outlook of the outflow
of liquidity and timing in 2021. Are we going to be stuck with this for a while or the pace of that liquidity surplus,
any thoughts that you guys have shared internally about how that plays out in 2021?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
That's the $2.6 billion question for us, and it's a great question. We've spent a lot of time over the last couple of
quarters, thinking about that and the stickiness of it. And then for us, it's compounded because we typically have
seasonal inflow of deposit growth that occurs in the back half of any given year. And so really trying to bifurcate
between what are search deposits and what are normal growth and I mentioned some of the activities of our
bankers and they're out winning new business.
And some of that business are very, very significant deposit relationships. And so we have that noise that gets
added in. And, of course, we have all the details, but you can't get there from just seeing a growth number year-
to-date or quarter-over-quarter. But that stickiness is something that we've challenged ourselves to think about
and walk through. We talked about PPP forgiveness. Well, in order to get forgiveness, they had to spend the
money. And so when we think about almost $1 billion of those deposits it could be related to PPP, and it's actually
a few hundred million more than that because we have depositors that obtain PPP elsewhere and put the money
with us.
And so then it's trying to peel back the layers of the onion and figure out how much of that is just customers
greening up, how much of it is that there – there have been great years. Some of them are doing very, very well,
and they're just sitting on the cash, because either for their own investment purposes, or reinvestment in their
business, they want more certainty. So it's a very complex issue, and that's been part of the struggle that Aaron
and the team have had in terms of how much to put back into the bond market.
And I'll let Aaron and Chris jump in and add their perspective because I know that this is a – not quite daily but
almost daily conversation between the two of them.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Merrywell A
Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yes. This is Chris, and it is almost daily. I think there's a couple of things that I would add to that that remain to be
seen, and some of it is, is there another round of stimulus. Deposits have accumulated through basically lower
spending. But as Clint mentioned, some of the businesses are what I would describe as thriving. Do they choose
to make an investment at some time? Do they pull those funds out and put them somewhere else in an
investment aspect? We're always trying to encourage with us [indiscernible] (00:55:47) that. But we'll see how
that part of it plays out.

And then on the other side of that are people who are maybe humping down a little bit more and are being very
conservative, because they're not sure what the winter holds for them or what is the crystal ball saying. They may
start to spend some of that money just to staying in business and things of that nature. So I think another round is
stimulus would tell us a lot about what's going to happen there. I'd be more comfortable if I knew what was
coming and what has been announced, and I could probably say it's a little stickier. But I think you're in between
those two things.
And as of today and in our continued conversations, we continue to see – it remains to be sticky. And then, you
see the results for the second quarter and it grew outside of our normal seasonal activities.
And with that, I'll let Aaron add anything.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
No, I would just say that we continue to do a lot of analysis and try to understand the depositor behavior. But I
think, Clint and Chris did a good job kind of summing that up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
I appreciate the thoughts there. And my other question, in the – who knows variety again. But, Andy, you touched
on the winter months and given your Northwest exposure on the hospitality side, the restaurants, maybe hotels.
As you talk to borrowers and they prepare for maybe colder months, I guess, is that you get the sense that that's
indeed a tougher environment versus a group that's maybe a little more adept at managing a new normal or as
they've changed their business practices, trying to get a sense for at some point it's a black or white being outside
or indoors, but can they weather that into the winter and what are borrowers saying to that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew L. McDonald A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I think that the easiest example to talk about is the portfolio of hotels out on the Oregon Coast with people
not able to travel to places overseas or not comfortable getting on an airplane or yes, I can go to Hawaii, but my
two-week vacation is stuck in quarantine. A lot of those folks had what turned out to be record summer. Certainly,
back in spring, it looked a lot worse when everybody was canceling. But, in the end, people flock to the Oregon
Coast and we saw that same consistent behavior with where we have hospitality properties, for example,
[indiscernible] (00:58:42) and some of the more vacation-type places.
Well, now the key is, did they generate enough liquidity to get to the next summer season because one of the
things that will be different this winter is that out on the Oregon Coast, they would still have business meetings.
They would have different organizations that would get together, people who collect Barbie Dolls, or collect coins,
or have an interest in something, right, they get together and have a convention. Well, those meetings aren't
going to occur this winter and so that incremental cash flow won't be there. So the amount of liquidity that they
accumulated coming out of what was a very successful summer season, we now have to project out if that's going
to be sufficient to get them to the next summer season.
And that's exactly what we're working with our borrowers on. And business owners are generally optimistic
people. So they're feeling pretty good, especially [indiscernible] (00:59:54) coming out of. And again, as Clint
mentioned, a lot of us have traveled around the footprint. And it has been very encouraging to see how
businesses have already adapted to a lot of these challenges. So I always come back feeling a lot better.

But, nevertheless, right now, the story is still how much liquidity you have. And if you generated that liquidity
because you had record attendance at your hotel occupancy during the summer, or if you were able to boost your
revenues with outside dining, did you do it enough to get you through those cold winter months and that's the
conversations that we're having. And, of course, those conversations are ongoing. And we'll know more as we get
to the end of the fourth quarter, because we'll be able to assess that. And that's why, I remain cautious in those
segments.

Jacquelynne Bohlen Q

You had really good trend so far in what you've been submitting for forgiveness. It appears to be a little bit higher
than some of the other conversations I've been having. Just curious as to what you – and I know there's a lot of
interpretations, but just curious as to what you think the timing might be for getting forgiveness for some of the
portfolio this quarter versus 2021?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Merrywell A
Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, Jackie, this is Chris. We've had good response to – we opened up our portal back in August, and we've
actually had about a third of the as far as numbers go that have applied to forgiveness. So we've had a little over
1,400 have applied. It's a couple of hundred million dollars. We don't expect to probably get that level back this
year. So some of it most likely and Aaron alluded to it earlier, probably looking into the first, second quarter next
year, and maybe some of it trails even into the third quarter. But they're starting to trickle in. I wouldn't say that it's
fast by any means and we're – again, we're seeing that about third of the borrowers, if you will, have applied for
forgiveness already.

Okay. Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then it was a very interesting comment that you had in both the press
release and I think it was part of the prepared remarks as well in terms of just working to retain talent during a
challenging environment given what people have going on in their personal lives, how has retention been now
versus how it was, say, a year ago?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Merrywell A
Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Retention, I'd say, has actually been pretty good. We're finding creative ways to work around issues distance
learning, things of that nature, so we can be a little bit flexible. Other team members are stepping in to help and
so we've been able to minimize a little bit of that turnover. I think I'm probably more optimistic of the talent that
we're starting to see that is wanting to come to work with us. From all the disruption that is going on and the things
that you've seen out there, there are very high-quality bankers that are calling us and reengaging in
conversations, and that's always a positive.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jacquelynne Bohlen Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And that...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
I'll just add a couple of points. Early on in the pandemic, the first few months, we saw a small uptick in folks that
were at or beyond what you would consider a normal retirement age that elected to retire. I think the uncertainty
and strain of coming to work in a pandemic environment was more than they wanted to deal with. So we did see a
little bit of that and it was understandable.
I think, as Chris mentioned, some of the things that we're seeing in terms of outreach from other bankers across
our footprint, one of the biggest challenges that as a management team that we've been very focused on is
maintaining our culture. And that's challenging when you're in a remote work environment. And I think that we've
done a really good job as a team of maintaining that culture and keeping folks connected to our organization.
And I think that's what we're seeing with other organizations that maybe have struggled in that regard. And we're
starting to get that outreach from some of their employees. And so that's an encouraging – I guess, an
encouraging time from our perspective in terms of what we think we'll be able to do from an organic standpoint as
we move forward.

Jacquelynne Bohlen Q

Maybe just on the deposit growth, it's been fairly robust here still. And I just want to get a sense for where it's
coming from, how much of it's kind of existing customers versus new and whether or not there's anything unusual
this quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Merrywell A
Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
I can't tell you unusual for the fourth quarter, but for the third quarter, it was pretty much a mix between new
business. As Clint had mentioned, some of our bankers have brought in some pretty significant new accounts,
and just existing clients increase some of that as the seasonal and some of it's just the reduced spending habits.
On the consumer side, as I mentioned, we saw more of a return to normal or approaching back to normal with
card spend and things of that nature. So most of it's been commercial. It's a bit of a – it's a mix in that. And again,
we're watching almost day – we watch it daily, and we talked about it frequently during the week. And there hasn't
been anything yet that's come out where I see a big runoff or something of that nature. I'll see if anybody wants to
add anything to that but...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aaron James Deer A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, I would just say that the – well, I would certainly characterize a lot of what's happening on the deposit front
as unusual. There's nothing that was out of character. We didn't add any broker or something like that, that could
bump that number up.

Okay. And then, just on the pipeline, I'm not sure if you quantified that during your prepared comments, but any
color on the size of the pipeline either linked quarter year-over-year, and whether or not the expectation is you
might be able to show net loan growth ex-Ag?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Merrywell A
Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Matt, we don't typically share the amounts for the pipeline. I can tell you that, yes, it's rebuilding on a year-over-
year comparison. We're not where we were in previous years. But that's understandable based on the
environment. The positive is it's rebuilding. I'd say we're cautiously optimistic into the fourth quarter of what that
looks like. Some timing may kind of play up into the year closures and things of that nature.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then, just on capital management. I wanted to touch on the buyback and M&A conversations. I guess,
how aggressive might you get with the buyback and what – if you could also give us an update on any
commentary around M&A in terms of active conversations whether they've picked up?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah, well, the buyback has been one of the tools that we've used for capital management for a long period of
time. And we had the plan that expired in May and we wanted to just let some time pass and see how things
played out with the pandemic and before we decided on what a new plan might look like. And we're looking at our
current capital levels, and we're very comfortable with those. We're very comfortable with all the various scenarios
we've done from a capital stress test point of view.
Our expectation around the performance of the loan portfolio going forward, our current ACL level, and then when
we look at the market volatility that's there, we just wanted the flexibility and felt like it was the appropriate time to
bring that tool back into the mix. And so I can't give you any specifics around levels, or frequency, or anything like
that with it. But I think you've followed us for a very long period of time, and you know that we've been good
stewards of capital and that we've used the combination of our regular dividend and M&A and special dividend
and share repurchases to manage those capital levels. And we're still significantly higher than the 12% long-term
goal that we have for total capital or 8% TCE. So we'll be strategic with it. And when it is appropriate, we'll use
that tool.
With respect to M&A, I think everybody is starting to kind of – they were hunkered down for much of the second
quarter. And I think as the third quarter went on and their own business has started to stabilize, and we started to
get clarity on the outlook for the rate environment and the difficult operating environment that the industry is going
to be faced with for the next two to four years, I think that folks started reconnecting, if you will. So not necessarily
what I'd call M&A – robust M&A conversations, but definitely staying in touch with one another and just seeing if –
as we progress through the tail end of the pandemic and the credit ripple that comes from that and all the
challenges, there's a lot of banks that I think don't have the scale that they need to drive the value for their
shareholders that will be expected. And so I think there will be opportunities for M&A and I think just from an
industry's perspective, I really think there's going to be some pent-up demand. And I think we'll start to see that
play out in the coming year.
