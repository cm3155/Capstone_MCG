John M. Campbell
Director-Investor Relations, Wells Fargo & Co.
Good morning. Thank you for joining our call today, where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike
Santomassimo, will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.
Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings materials, including the release,
financial supplement, and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution
you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties.
Factors that may cause the actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings,
including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial
measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our
SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website.
I will now turn the call over to Charlie.

Charles William Scharf
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Thanks, John. I'll make some brief comments about our first quarter results and update you on our priorities. I'll
then turn the call over to Mike to review first quarter results in more detail before we take your questions. Let me
start with some first quarter highlights. Our results in the quarter were strong and reflected the continued progress
we're making to improve returns. We grew revenue from both the fourth quarter and a year ago. We continue to
make progress on our efficiency initiatives, and expenses declined for both the fourth quarter and a year ago
driven by lower operating losses but we continue to be focused on controlling other expenses as well.
The consumer and majority of our businesses remain strong. Delinquencies and net charge-offs have continued
to slowly increase as expected. We're looking for signs of accelerated deterioration in asset classes or segments
of our customers and, broadly speaking, we saw little change in the trends from the prior quarter. However,
weakness continues to develop in commercial real estate office, and Mike will discuss this in more detail. Given
what we're seeing, we're taking incremental actions to tighten credit on higher-risk segments but continue to lend
broadly.
We increased our allowance for credit losses for the fourth consecutive quarter. Our economic expectations used
to support the allowance have not changed meaningfully, but we do continue to look at specific asset classes
such as commercial real estate to appropriately assess the adequacy of the allowance. We will continue to
monitor the trends in each of our loan portfolios to determine if future action is warranted.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2023
Both commercial and consumer average loans were up from a year ago but were relatively stable from the fourth
quarter. Consumer spending remains strong with growth in both debit and credit card spend, but spending began
to soften late in the quarter. The decline in average deposits that started a year ago continued in the first quarter
primarily driven by customers seeking higher-yielding alternatives and continued growth in consumer spending.
We did see some moderate inflows from the few specific banks that have been highlighted in the press, but those
inflows have abated. Our CET1 ratio, which was already strong, increased to 10.8% even as we resumed
common stock repurchases in the first quarter, buying back $4 billion in common stock.
Let me share some thoughts on the recent market events impacting the banking industry. We're glad that the
work we have completed over the last several years has put us in a position to help support the US financial
system. Along with 10 other large banks, we utilized our strength and liquidity and we made a $5 billion uninsured
deposit into First Republic Bank, reflecting our confidence in the country's banking system and to help provide
First Republic with liquidity to continue serving its customers. I'm proud of everything our employees have done
during this historic period to be there for our customers. We believe banks of all sizes are an important part of our
financial system as each is uniquely positioned to serve their customers and communities.
It's important to recognize that banks have different operating models and that the banks that failed in the first
quarter were quite different from what people think of when they think about the typical regional bank. These
particular banks had concentrated business models with heavy reliance on uninsured deposits. Our franchise,
and those of many other banks, operate with a broader business model and more diversified funding sources. It is
times like these that the many benefits of our own franchise become even more clear. Our diversified business
model provides opportunities to serve our customers broadly which reduces concentration risk across the different
elements of risk.
Most importantly, our customers benefit from our size and the range of banking services we provide which helps
us build a full relationship with individuals and companies. We also have strong capital and liquidity positions
which include a mix of deposits and access to multiple funding sources, and our continued focus on financial and
credit risk management allows us to support our customers throughout economic cycles.
Now, let me update you on the progress we've made on our strategic priorities. Our top priority remains building
out our risk and control framework appropriate for our company. I spent time in my recent annual letter
highlighting why we remain confident in our ability to complete this work, including: having much more effective
reporting and processes in place to provide appropriate oversight, adding close to 10,000 people across
numerous risk and control-related groups as part of our commitment to make the investments needed to complete
the work, and building the management disciplines and culture to govern and execute the work which includes the
operating committee reviewing risks and regulatory progress and escalations on a weekly basis.
I also summarized the actions we've taken to simplify the way we operate. This work continued in the first quarter
as we largely completed the exit of the correspondent home lending business as part of our plans to simplify that
business. We're also narrowing our retail mortgage business to focus on predominantly bank customers and
underserved communities. Our strategy includes broadening our existing investment from the Special Purpose
Credit Program to include purchased loans, investing an additional $100 million to advance racial equity in home
ownership, and deploying additional home mortgage consultants in local minority communities. We continue to
transform the way we serve our customers by offering innovative products and solutions.
We announced a multiyear agreement with Choice Hotels to launch a new co-branded credit card this month,
creating a best-in-class credit card program designed to enhance our customers' experience and bring them more
value. We rolled out Early Pay Day late last year which makes eligible direct deposits available up to two days

early. In the first quarter, this enhancement provided customers early access to over $200 billion in direct
deposits. We launched Flex Loan in the fourth quarter, a digital-only small-dollar loan that provides eligible
customers convenient and affordable access to funds. Customer response continues to exceed our expectations
and we've originated over 100,000 loans since November. Digital adoption and usage among our consumer
customers continue to increase. We added over 500,000 mobile active customers in the first quarter and digital
log-ins increased 6% from a year ago.
Since rolling out Vantage, our new enhanced digital experience for our commercial and corporate clients late last
year, we've received overwhelmingly positive feedback on the new user experience. Vantage uses AI and
machine learning to provide a tailored and intuitive platform based on our clients' specific needs. We also
continued to make progress on our environmental, social and governance work. We announced a $50 million
grant to the NAACP to support efforts to advance racial equity in America. This is the single largest donation the
NAACP has ever received from a corporation and builds on our longstanding relationship with the NAACP that
spans more than 20 years. The Wells Fargo Foundation expanded its commitment to housing affordability through
another $20 million Housing Affordability Breakthrough Challenge to advance ideas to help meet the need for
more affordable homes across the country.
We also announced a $20 million commitment to advance economic opportunities in Native American
communities, including addressing housing, small business, financial health, and sustainability. Before
concluding, I wanted to highlight the management changes we announced yesterday. Mary Mack, the CEO of
Consumer & Small Business Banking, is retiring this summer. She spent her entire career at Wells Fargo and has
led Consumer & Small Business Banking for the past seven years through a significant amount of change,
including defining a new path forward for the business. I can think of few Wells Fargo colleagues who have done
as much for our company and have been as visible in the communities that we serve over such a long period of
time.
We also announced that Saul Van Beurden, Head of Technology at Wells Fargo, will succeed Mary. Saul is a
strong leader, a technologist, and he knows how to run a business. This makes him the ideal person to lead
Consumer & Small Business Banking into the future. Our branch network will continue to be the key to business,
but our customers expect us to provide them with increasingly digitized and seamless banking experiences
across all channels. Saul understands this deeply and has consistently proven his ability to convert new products
and services across Wells Fargo.
Finally, Tracy Kerrins, currently Head of Consumer Technology, will become Head of Technology for the
company, reporting to me. Tracy has worked in the technology and finance industry for more than 20 years and
has led a series of business-critical initiatives to modernize our technology platforms across our consumer
businesses. She's a strong results-driven leader. It's always great when we can tap our own leaders for roles
within the company. And I want to thank Mary for everything she's done during her tenure at Wells Fargo. It's truly
been a pleasure working with her.
As we look forward, we're carefully watching customer behavior for clues on how the economic environment is
changing. Customer activity is still relatively strong, and delinquencies remain low, though they are increasing.
There are pockets of risks, such as commercial office real estate, which will likely impact institutions differently,
and we're proactively managing our own exposures. We continue to expect economic growth to slow and we are
prepared for a range of scenarios. We will continue to monitor both the markets and our customers and we will
react accordingly. Our diversified business model should enable us to support our customers throughout
economic cycles.

I'll now turn the call over to Mike.

Michael P. Santomassimo
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Thank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the first quarter was $5 billion or $1.23 per
diluted common share. While there was a lot going on in the banking industry around us, we continued to focus
on our priorities and our results reflected the progress we're making, which I'll highlight throughout the call.
Starting with capital and liquidity on slide 3. Our CET1 ratio is 10.8%, up approximately 20 basis points from the
fourth quarter, reflecting our earnings in the quarter and lower risk-weighted assets. After pausing share
repurchases for the prior three quarters, we repurchased $4 billion of common stock in the first quarter. Our CET1
ratio remained well above our required regulatory minimum plus buffers and we expect to continue to prudently
return excess capital to shareholders in the coming quarters. In the first quarter, our liquidity coverage ratio is
approximately 22 percentage points above the regulatory minimum. We continue to benefit from a diversified
deposit base with over 60% of our deposits in our Consumer Banking and Lending segment as of the first quarter,
which is a higher percentage than before the pandemic.
Turning to credit quality on slide 5. Net loan charge-offs continued to slowly increase to 26 basis points in the first
quarter, but were still below pre-pandemic levels. Commercial net loan charge-offs decreased $16 million from the
fourth quarter to 5 basis points; however, while losses improved, we continue to see some gradual weakening in
underlying credit performance, including higher non-performing assets. We are proactively monitoring our clients'
sensitivity to inflation and higher rates and are taking appropriate actions when warranted. We are also closely
monitoring our Commercial Real Estate office portfolio, and I'll share some more details on our exposure on the
next slide.
As expected, we've seen consumer delinquencies and losses gradually increase. Total consumer net loan
charge-offs increased $60 million in the fourth quarter to 56 basis points of average loans driven by an increase in
the credit card portfolio. While most consumers remain resilient, we've seen some consumer financial health
trends gradually weakening from a year ago, and we've continued to take credit tightening actions to position the
portfolio for a slowing economy.
Non-performing assets increased 7% from the fourth quarter, driven by higher Commercial Real Estate non-
accrual loans, but were down 12% from a year ago due to lower residential mortgage non-accrual loans. Of note,
87% of the non-accrual loans in our Commercial Real Estate portfolio were current on interest and 75% were
current on both principal and interest as of the end of the first quarter. Our allowance for credit losses increased
$643 million in the first quarter, reflecting an increase for Commercial Real Estate loans, primarily office loans, as
well as an increase for credit card and auto loans.
Given the increased focus on Commercial Real Estate loans, especially office, we provided more details in our
portfolio on slide 6. We had $154.7 billion of Commercial Real Estate loans outstanding at the end of the first
quarter, with $35.7 billion of office loans, which represented 4% of our total loans outstanding. The office market
continues to show signs of weakness due to lower demand, higher financing costs and challenging capital market
conditions. While we haven't seen this translate to meaningful loss content yet, we expect to see more stress over
time. As you would expect, we have been de-risking the office portfolio, which resulted in commitments declining
5% from a year ago and we continue to proactively work with borrowers to manage our exposure, including
structural enhancements and paydowns as warranted.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2023
As you can see on the slide, we've provided some additional data on the office portfolio, including approximately
12% is owner-occupied, therefore the loan performance is mostly tied to the cash flow of the owner's operating
business rather than rents paid by tenants. Nearly one-third had recourse to a guarantor, typically through a
repayment guarantee. The portfolio is geographically diverse and, as you'd expect, the largest concentrations are
in California and New York. Over two-thirds of our office loans are in the Corporate and Investment Banking
business and the vast majority of this portfolio is institutional quality real estate with high-caliber sponsors.
While approximately 80% of it's Class A, keep in mind that this is a single measure that is hard to evaluate in
isolation. For example, newer or refurbished properties may perform better regardless of whether they are Class
A or B. We are providing this data to give you more insight into the portfolio, but as is usually the case in
Commercial Real Estate, each property situation is different, and a myriad of other variables such as leasing
rates, loan to value, and debt yields can determine performance, which is why we regularly review the portfolio on
a loan-by-loan basis.
As a result of market conditions and recent increases in criticized assets and non-accrual loans, we've increased
our allowance for credit losses for office loans for the past four quarters. The allowance for credit losses coverage
ratio at the end of the first quarter for the office portfolio in the Corporate Investment Bank was 5.7%. We will
continue to closely monitor this portfolio, but as has been the case in prior cycles, this will likely play out over an
extended period of time as we actively work with borrowers to help resolve issues they may be facing.
On slide 7, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 6% from a year ago and were relatively stable
from the fourth quarter while period-end loans declined 1% from the fourth quarter with lower balances across our
consumer and commercial portfolios. I'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results.
Average loan yields increased 244 basis points from a year ago and 56 basis points from the fourth quarter,
reflecting a higher interest rate environment. Average deposits declined 7% from a year ago and 2% from the
fourth quarter due to the consumer deposit outflows as customers continued to reallocate cash in higher yielding
alternatives and continued spending.
During the market stress last month, we experienced a brief increase in deposit inflows that has since abated and
while our period-end deposit balances were slightly higher than we expected at the beginning of the quarter,
they're still down 2% from the fourth quarter. As expected, our average deposit cost increased 37 basis points
from the fourth quarter to 83 basis points with higher deposit costs across all operating segments in response to
rising interest rates. Our mix of non-interest-bearing deposits declined from 35% in the fourth quarter to 32% in
the first quarter, but remained above pre-pandemic levels.
Turning to net interest income on slide 8. First quarter net interest income was $13.3 billion, which was 45%
higher than a year ago, as we continued to benefit from the impact of higher rates. The $97 million decline from
the fourth quarter was due to two fewer business days. Our full year net interest income guidance has not
changed from last quarter as we still expect 2023 net interest income to grow by approximately 10% compared
with 2022. Ultimately, the amount of net interest income we earn this year will depend on a variety of factors,
many of which are uncertain, including the absolute level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, deposit
balances, mix and repricing and loan demand.
Turning to expenses on slide 9. Non-interest expense declined 1% from a year ago, driven by lower operating
losses and the impact of efficiency initiatives. The increase in personnel expense from the fourth quarter was
driven by approximately $650 million of seasonally higher expenses in the first quarter, including payroll taxes,
restricted stock expense for retirement-eligible employees and 401(k) matching contributions. Our full year 2023
non-interest expense, excluding operating losses, is still expected to be approximately $50.2 billion, unchanged

from the guidance we provided last quarter. As a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory and
customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses.
Turning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on slide 10. Consumer & Small
Business Banking revenue increased 28% from a year ago as higher net interest income driven by the impact of
higher interest rates was partially offset by lower deposit-related fees driven by the overdraft policy changes we
rolled out last year. We are continuing to make investments in this business. We're beginning to increase
marketing spend. We're accelerating the efforts to renovate and refurbish our branches. For our bankers, we're
investing in new tools and capabilities to provide better and more personalized advice to customers. We're
continuing to enhance our mobile app, and mobile active users are up 4% year-over-year. And we're also seeing
increased activity and positive initial indicators after our rollout of Wells Fargo Premier last year.
It's early on for all of these initiatives, but we are starting to see some green shoots. At the same time, we
continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives. Teller transactions continued to decline with reduced head count.
We reduced head count by 9% and total branches were down 4% from a year ago. In Home Lending, mortgage
rates remained elevated and the mortgage market continue to decline. Our Home Lending revenue declined 42%
from a year ago driven by lower mortgage originations, including a significant decline from the correspondent
channel and lower revenue from the resecuritization of loans purchased from securitization pools. We continue to
reduce head count in the first quarter and we expect staffing levels will continue to decline due to the strategic
changes we announced earlier this year.
We stopped accepting applications from the correspondent channel as announced in January and began to
reduce the complexity and the size of the servicing book. During the first quarter, we successfully marketed
mortgage servicing rights for approximately $50 billion of loans serviced for others that we expect to close later
this year. We will continue to look for additional opportunities to simplify and reduce the size of our servicing
business. Credit Card revenue increased 3% from a year ago due to higher loan balances driven by higher point-
of-sale volume. Auto revenue declined 12% from a year ago driven by lower loan balances and continued loan
spread compression from credit tightening actions and continued price competition due to rising interest rates.
Personal Lending revenue was up 9% from a year ago due to higher loan balances.
Turning to some key business drivers on slide 11. Mortgage originations declined 83% from a year ago and 55%
from the fourth quarter with declines in both correspondent and retail originations. As I mentioned, we stopped
accepting correspondent applications in January so going forward, our originations will be focused on serving
Wells Fargo customers and underserved communities. The size of our auto portfolio has declined for four
consecutive quarters and the balances were down [ph] 80% (00:23:38) at the end of the first quarter compared to
a year ago. Origination volume declined 32% from a year ago, reflecting credit tightening actions and continued
price competition.
Debit card spending increased 2% in the first quarter compared to a year ago and increased from a 1% year-over-
year growth in the fourth quarter. Discretionary spending drove the growth, with non-discretionary spending stable
from the fourth quarter levels. Credit card spending increased 16% from a year ago, in line with the year-over-
year growth in the fourth quarter, with sustained growth in both discretionary and non-discretionary spending.
Spending growth slowed throughout the quarter but were still at double-digit levels in March. We continue to see
some slight moderation in payment rates in the first quarter but they were still well above pre-pandemic levels.
Turning to Commercial Banking results on slide 12. Middle Market Banking revenue grew by 73% from a year ago
due to the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances while deposit-related fees were lower,
reflecting higher earnings credit rates on non-interest-bearing deposits. Asset-Based Lending and Leasing

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2023
revenue increased 7% year-over-year driven by loan growth which was partially offset by lower net gains from
equity securities. Average loan balances were up 15% in the first quarter compared to a year ago driven by new
customer growth and higher line utilization. After being stable in the second half of last year, line utilization
increased slightly in the first quarter. Average loan balances have grown for seven consecutive quarters and were
up 2% from the fourth quarter with the growth in Asset-Based Lending and Leasing driven by continued growth in
client inventory. Growth in Middle Market Banking was once again driven by larger clients, including both new and
existing relationships, which more than offset declines from our smaller clients.
Turning to Corporate and Investment Banking on slide 13. Banking revenue increased 37% from a year ago
driven by stronger Treasury Management results, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates. Investment
Banking fees declined from a year ago, reflecting lower market activity with declines across all major products in
nearly all industries. While commercial real estate market transactions are down across the industry, our
Commercial Real Estate revenue grew 32% from a year ago driven by the impact of higher interest rates and
higher loan balances. Markets revenue increased 53% from a year ago driven by higher trading results across all
asset classes. Average loans grew 4% from a year ago but were down from the fourth quarter. Lower balances in
banking reflected a combination of slow demand, increased payoffs and relatively stable line utilization. Declining
Commercial Real Estate balances were driven by the higher rate environment and lower commercial real estate
sales volumes.
On slide 14, Wealth and Investment Management revenue was down 2% compared to a year ago driven by lower
asset-based fees due to lower market valuations. Growth in net interest income was driven by the impact of
higher rates which was partially offset by lower deposit balances as customers continue to reallocate cash into
higher-yielding alternatives. At the end of the first quarter, cash alternatives were approximately 12% of total client
assets, up from approximately 4% a year ago. Expenses decreased 4% from a year ago driven by lower revenue-
related compensation and the impact of efficiency initiatives. Average loans were down 1% from a year ago
primarily due to a decline in securities-based lending.
Slide 15 highlights our corporate results. Revenue declined $103 million or 83% from a year ago as higher net
interest income was more than offset by lower results in our affiliated venture capital and private equity
businesses. Results in the first quarter included $342 million of net losses on equity securities or $223 million pre-
tax and net of non-controlling interests. In summary, our results in the first quarter reflect an improvement in our
earnings capacity. We grew revenue and reduced expenses and had strong growth in pre-tax pre-provision profit.
As expected, our net charge-offs have continued to slowly increase from historical lows and we are closely
monitoring our portfolios and taking credit tightening actions where appropriate. Our capital levels grew even as
we resume common stock repurchases and we expect repurchases to continue. And the guidance we provided
last quarter for full year 2023 net interest income expenses excluding operating losses has not changed.
We will now take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for
today will come from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, everyone. Hey, thank you for taking the question. Mike, was hoping to just start out on the deposit
side. So, when you talked about the influx of deposits from some of the sort of special situations having abated,
did that money actually leave the bank or is it just sort of the inflows that have stopped?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. Hey, Scott. Thanks for the question. Look, the inflows stopped, right, and they came in in a pretty short
period of time and those inflows stopped. And I think what you're seeing since then is just normal spending on the
consumer side and normal activity across the other businesses.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. And then, I guess, maybe switch gears just a bit. I think in your prepared remarks, you had
discussed plans to sort of prudently return excess capital in coming quarters. Was very glad to see the
resumption in repurchase in the first quarter. But just given all the kind of crosscurrents that we've got, whether it's
uncertainty on the regulatory environment or uncertainty on the economy kind of countered against your very
strong capital levels, just curious for maybe a little more color on how you would be thinking about share
repurchase through the remainder of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. This is Charlie. Let me take a stab. I would say, listen, I think the way we feel about it is our capital levels
grew quarter-over-quarter even after we purchased the $4 billion of stock, so it just shows our ability to generate
capital, if necessary, because of the environment or regulatory changes or things like that. So, because of that,
we do feel like we have the ability to continue to return capital to shareholders while we still have plenty of
flexibility to deal with anything, which could come our way, and so our excess above the regulatory minimums
plus buffers is extremely high, beyond what we feel that it needs to be. So we think we can continue to address
that and still be very prudent with how we manage capital.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Wonderful. Okay. I have a bunch more questions, but I have a feeling they'll be asked going forward as well. So,
Charlie and Mike, thank you guys very much. Really appreciate it.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hey good morning. So wanted to get a little bit more granular on some of the expense trends that we're seeing.
We've gone through the exercise of benchmarking your segment efficiency ratios versus peers. Clearly, you've
made significant strides improving profitability across virtually every segment, Commercial, CIB and Wealth. The
PPNR margins are running really in line with the peer group. It's still the consumer efficiency ratio in the mid-60s,
which is running well above peers. And I was hoping you could just speak to the opportunity on the expense side
within consumer. How much of a benefit should you see from the retrenchment in mortgage? And maybe what do
you see as a normalized efficiency target for the segment just given your current mix of business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Hey Steve. It's Mike. I'll start and Charlie can chime in if he wants. I think when you think about consumer, I think
we still have a lot more work to do there, and it's both in the consumer lending space or the mortgage space as
we simplify the servicing side of that business, and that just takes a little bit of time to work its way through. It
needs to be thoughtful and, in some cases, requires a little bit of investment in technology and the like. And then
on the Consumer Banking side, we've continued to rationalize the branch footprint and branch setup. We continue
to see teller transactions and other things decline, and so I think you'll see us focus there. And hopefully what
you've seen in that segment is a consistent quarter-on-quarter decline in head count and other factors, and that
will sort of continue to hopefully be the case. And then when you think about just where the end state is, we
shouldn't look any different than our peers, our best-in-class peers for each of our segments, including that one.
So, over a period of time, that's the goal.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
And I would just add, when you look at that segment, obviously, mix versus other people is an issue. Our Home
Lending business is, today, extremely inefficient, which is part of the reason why we made the decisions that we
made. So we've got a lot of wood to chop there, which will play out over a period of time to make that business
more efficient. And as we've talked about on the Consumer Banking side, we've done I think for many, many
years after Mary got her job in the Consumer Banking operation, our focus was dealing with the cleanup, which
they've done an exceptional job in the Consumer & Small Business Bank about, and then turned our attention to
becoming more efficient, which she has worked really hard on, and that's a combination of looking at our branch
footprint, staffing within the branches, migrating people to digital. And we're behind on that, but there has been a
lot of progress made over the last year-and-a-half to two years, and so there's still tremendous amount of
opportunity there, but it's in flight.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Really helpful color. Just for my follow-up, wanted to unpack some of the NII trends that we're seeing within the
Wealth side specifically. And there's a big focus right now on yield-seeking behavior if the higher-for-longer rate
environment persists. You and your peers have seen contraction in NII sequentially and continued deposit
outflows. Was hoping you could speak to whether you're seeing any abatement in just the pace of cash sorting or
yield-seeking behavior as of yet or if it's continued at a pretty healthy clip.

Yeah. I'll take that. And when you look at the sequential change in NII, it's really the fewer days in the quarter that
drove it. Otherwise, it's pretty flat to the fourth quarter as we thought it would be when we talked in January. When
you think about Wealth, it's been pretty stable, the trend. It's not accelerating, it's not decelerating at any
significant clip at this point. And what we see there is we're capturing those cash alternatives that people are
buying in the Wealth business. And so I think that trend will continue for a while, and the good news is we're
capturing that in other ways, but the trend has been pretty stable, and that's probably going to be the case for a
little longer.

John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Hi. Good morning. Mike, was wondering what your outlook is for the second quarter NII. And maybe if you could
talk a little bit about the puts and takes to that and what you're thinking for second quarter? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. John, as you look at – as things are trending, you can see where deposits are on a period-end and an
average basis, so that's probably input number one. And then you can see that deposit yields have increased,
right. So those two things are going to be the biggest drivers. So you should expect a little bit of a stepdown from
Q1 into Q2. And we'll see exactly sort of what that looks like as we get a little bit into the quarter, but I think the
variables are there to kind of come up with a range of outcomes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Yeah. Okay. And the outlook for the full year obviously embeds a pretty big stepdown from the first quarter
starting point. Can you give us any more color about the types of assumptions you have embedded into the full
year outlook on deposit, flows, mix shift and reprice beta?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. Sure. And as we've talked over the last few quarters, there's still a ton of uncertainty out there with regards
to really all of the inputs that go into that, right, and whether it's the mix of deposits, the absolute level or where
pricing will be. And so, our guide assumes that it's still going to be a pretty competitive space for deposits on the
pricing side that we will still see some mix shift happening and that we'll see some moderate declines as people
continue to spend and the trends happen. So, as we talked about even last quarter, I think as time goes by, we
get more and more information, and so we're hopeful that there's upside to the forecast, but we'll see that in the
second half of the year and it will be a function of how all those factors play out. But we're hopeful that we'll see
that and there'll be some upside there.

Operator: The next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey good morning. I just want to ask a follow-up on the cost side. So I think we're all pretty clear on your view of
continuing to hold the core flat from here. But I think an ongoing question is just, as we look further out, and I
know there's no crystal ball here, like, at what point do you get the line of sight when that next wave of gross
saves related to all the duplicative and extra buildup in the infrastructure related to risk compliance, et cetera,
when do you get the line of sight of when you can start to sunset that? Because I know you've talked about that
as a big point of how you get the ROE up over the medium term.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. Ken, let me try to clarify a little bit of that. So I think when you look at what we talked about last quarter in
terms of getting to a 15% ROTCE in the medium term, that didn't assume that we would have to take out
significant amount of the costs related to the risk and regulatory buildouts that we're doing. That efficiency on
those expenses will be out a little while. It could be years in terms of before we really get at some of that. But I
think our focus is to get the return to a sustainable 15% in the medium term by not having to rely on that. It really
goes back to what we talked about, really making sure capital gets optimized, not just in terms of shareholder
return, but also across the balance sheet, requires us to continue to execute on the efficiency initiatives outside of
the risk and regulatory work. And then we'll start to get the benefit of some of the investments we've been making
now for the last couple years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
And I would just add to that, just to be clear. When we think about the opportunities to continue to drive efficiency
in the company, we don't even think about all the expenses related to the risk and regulatory framework work that
we're doing. That work is and those expenses are – they're necessary, and those are not an excuse for us not to
be efficient in everything else that we do. And so, as we've talked about in the consumer businesses a second
ago, we look across all the things that we do, and there's still significant opportunity to just become more efficient
and either reduce the expense base or provide more capacity to invest going forward. And at some point, can we
become more efficient in how we run the risk infrastructure of the company? Probably, but that's not on the radar
screen and not necessary for us to achieve our efficiency goals.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. And thanks for those clarifications. Just a question on the fee side. I know watching your trading results are
a lot different than watching some of the bigger peers. But just looking at that $1.3 billion on the face of the
income statement this quarter in the context of the environment, can you help us put that into context? Was that
just exceptional result this quarter? Did it have anything we should be mindful of as we think forward? And just
your general outlook there. Thank you.

Yeah. Sure. We certainly benefited from the volatility that we saw, particularly in the rate market and some of the
other asset classes in the quarter, and you can see that in the results. But when you look at some of the core
platforms in FX and other areas, we've been just consistently investing in some of those platforms, so hopefully
over time you'll see good results there, but the quarter definitely was influenced by the volatility that we saw
across the market.

Operator: The next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the capital comments. I guess, Charlie, you talked about this. Is it
fair for us to assume – clearly, we have the SCB coming out of the stress test. That'd be one data point, and then
the Basel reforms. Should we assume that the CET1 likely drifts higher, maybe 11%, maybe higher in the near
term, while you still buy back stock? Is that a right assumption? And secondly, I think, Mike, you mentioned about
optimizing for capital and RWA. Just maybe if you can call out a few things that you can do to optimize RWA
relative to where the balance sheet is today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. Sure. Thanks. I think the simple answer to your first question is no. We don't expect it to continue to keep
drifting up. Certainly, we'll find out the results of CCAR with everybody else in June, and then we've got Basel IV,
which is a little bit longer timeline than that. But we're 160 basis points above the regulatory minimum buffers.
We've got plenty of capital to deal with whatever comes out of that. And as we said, over time, we'll get closer to
100 basis points or so above the 9.2%. And so I think there's plenty of capacity to deal with whatever comes and
continue to return money back to shareholders, as Charlie said.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
And so, I think the second part, just to be – and again, all I was trying to say is, we have a lot of flexibility to deal
with things that come our way and so we're not anticipating significant additional capital needs. We're not
anticipating that any potential downturn could create additional capital needs inside of the business. All we're
saying is that if any of those things were to happen, we have the flexibility to deal with that both because of the
amount of earnings that we have as well as the existing excess capital that we have. So, you add those – I mean,
you take that and you say all those things happened while we bought $4 billion of stock back this quarter, so we
feel we'll be able to continue to return capital and still maintain a very conservative position.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. And then, just to give you a couple examples to help illustrate the capital optimization. The mortgage
business is one of them. If we want mortgage exposure, we can buy securities. You don't have to always hold the
mortgage. If you're buying securities, you don't have to buy UMBS; you could buy Ginnies, and so there's plenty.
And then you could look at each of the underlying portfolios and make sure we're getting the return from a
14

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 14-Apr-2023
relationship point of view that we think, whether that's in the Commercial Bank or the Corporate Investment Bank.
And so I think there's plenty of areas that we can either reallocate capital to clients that we think we'll get better
returns for or optimize some of the underlying portfolios.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just one separate question. You made tremendous progress, Charlie, since taking over on the
compliance risk management front. There was a news article last night talking about some OCC MRAs. I don't
expect you to comment on that, but just give us a sense from a shareholder perspective your level of confidence
around the risk of another shoe dropping or a major setback to all the efforts and actions that you've taken to
address the regulatory orders, to the extent you can, just to give comfort that the progress that's been made is
getting us closer to the finish line as opposed to another big setback that could push us back again.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. Listen, I would refer you back to my shareholder letter where I wrote about it extensively, and I think I still
continue to feel exactly the way we felt when we wrote that letter – it wasn't that long ago – which is we have
continued work to do. I feel very confident in our ability to get the work done and that we're making progress. And
so, we live in an environment where things can come up. That's always the case so we don't want to pretend like
there are no risks of other things out there. But if there was anything specific, we would do our best to let you
know. And we feel good about the progress that we're making and are extremely focused on making sure that
we've got all the attention decked against it, but we're confident that the things that we're doing will close the gaps
that existed at the company when we got here.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. Back to the NII drivers. Can you maybe give us a updated expectation on how you're thinking
about loan growth here as you look through 2023? I know you've cited some of the pressures on the consumer
side, but some of the favorable trends still in commercial. And then separately on the deposit side, do you have
an updated expectation regarding your total deposit beta as we see pricing pressure continue?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, thanks. So, on the loan side, I think we're definitely seeing pockets of growth in places like the Commercial
Bank, and that's been pretty consistent now for a couple quarters. But the overall growth rate across total loans
has moderated for the last three quarters which is exactly what we thought might happen when we were talking
last summer, and so I think it'll still be pretty moderate. I wouldn't expect huge growth in loans over the rest of the
year and embedded in our guidance is some low single-digit growth rate in terms of loans for the year. And so I
think that's what we're assuming there. What was the second part again, John? Sorry.

Yeah. It was around your updated...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Oh, sorry. Beta, deposit beta, sorry. Yeah. No, look, on the deposit side, to-date betas have played out almost
exactly how we thought they would. And I think from here, the path of rates will matter, competition will matter.
And so, as I mentioned earlier in the call, we're still assuming it's going to be pretty competitive when we give you
the guidance that we gave you, and I think we may find hopefully that it gets – that maybe we're being a little
conservative there, but we do think at this point it'll still be competitive. And I think the betas will be pretty
reasonable though on the consumer side when you look back after the rate rises stop.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. Okay. Thanks, Mike. And then separately on the commercial real estate front, maybe if you could just
elaborate a little bit on the stress that you're seeing. I know you discussed office. Maybe can you talk about your
LTVs in office maybe on a refreshed basis, if you happen to have that, and maybe in other portfolios as well
because clearly, the change between origination LTVs versus where we're seeing refreshed levels come in are
clearly what is motivating some of the impact around reserve behavior? So, if you can give us a little color there,
that would be helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah, sure. Look, in the office space right now, as many others have said too, like this is going to play out over an
extended period of time. We're not seeing a lot of near-term stress in terms of whether clients are current or
seeing very big issues on a property-by-property basis at this point, but we do expect some of that to come. And I
think it'll be for all of the reasons that everyone's reporting on, right? And in particular, it'll be in cities that you see
weakness in places like San Francisco and LA, a little bit in Seattle. And so it's all the places where either lease
rates are already lower than the national average or the secular changes around back-to-office are changing in a
little bit more bigger way.
But it's going to take time and we just haven't seen it translate into loss content yet, and we're going very granular
property-by-property. And so, giving you LTV numbers from a portfolio – at a portfolio basis really isn't that helpful
at this point because it really is going to be a matter of what each of these underlying properties look like and
what the issues are there. And we haven't seen a lot of trades happening either recently, and so that also will
impact how you think about the valuations. And what we're doing is really just making sure we stress it in a whole
bunch of different ways on a property level basis to make sure we understand where the potential issues might
come from.

How are you doing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Couple questions, little bit of follow-up. But one on the credit side. Wanted to just understand a little bit about the
recoveries in commercial. I know in the deck you mentioned that commercial NCOs were down in part due to
higher recoveries. And just wanted to understand how long you see those recoveries persisting and is there any
driver for them actually increasing from here. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. There really isn't any story there, Betsy. I mean, we get recoveries every quarter, and there really isn't a
significant trend change one way or the other. And again, it's going to come back down to individual underlying
issues or situations that drive it quarter-to-quarter, but I wouldn't read too much into the trend.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then separately on the Wealth deposits. I know earlier in the call you addressed this that you would
expect to see the Wealth outflows continue at current pace or so for at least a little bit of time. I'm wondering is
there any anchor that you can give us with regard to Wealth deposits as a percentage of client assets that existed
pre-COVID that maybe we should anchor back on in modeling that line item.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. I mean, what we gave you in my commentary was just cash as a percentage of assets, and it's quite a bit
higher than it was before, about 12% now versus 4%, and obviously deposits is going to be a subcomponent of
that. And there are other drivers, right, of how much cash people are going to hold as a percentage of assets. And
right now, you're seeing a lot of – a lot of what is going into cash alts is coming out of other asset classes, so it's a
little harder to give you a specific number of, like, deposits as a percentage of assets because you're seeing
people sell equities and other asset classes and drive up those cash balances.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A

And so I would just take the current balance that you see in the Wealth space and the deposit side and assume it
continues to come down at a stable pace for a little bit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And just last question here on deposit betas. I know you indicated that it should be okay. I guess, I'm wondering
how you think about deposit betas this cycle versus last cycle. Similar? Higher? Lower? Any sense as to versus
prior cycle in magnitude would be great. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. Look, I mean, it'll be different obviously, and part of what's going to drive that is how long rates stay higher.
And I think that we'll find that out over a period of time. But as you can tell, where betas have performed so far,
they've performed pretty well when you look at it relative to the last cycle, particularly given how far rates have
moved up in excess of what happened last time. And they're behaving exactly as you might think, right. And if you
go portfolio by portfolio, the betas are pretty high on the large corporate side. That's been the case now for a
couple quarters. They're a little bit lower in the Commercial Bank given the nature of that client base. And in the
consumer side, they're relatively low, given the amount of rate rises that we've seen so far. And so I think on the
large corporate side, you'll see those be pretty consistent from here, and the consumer side will be a function of
all the things we talked about earlier.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Yeah. It was pretty small when you look at that change, so I wouldn't read too much into it. I think people are still –
there's still a lot of activity out there and consumers are still out spending both in the debit side and the credit side.
So I wouldn't read into a couple weeks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then separately, I know I always kind of harp on some of these reg issues, and I appreciate the New
York Post article yesterday, you can't comment specifically on, but it did allude to some concerns in your trading
business, and obviously it performed extremely well. You've been growing it, although I don't think you're growing
it super aggressively. But there's been some political comments, maybe it was – I don't know, six months ago or
so that you shouldn't be growing your Capital Markets business while you're investing in these other areas. So, I
guess, maybe you could just address the trading businesses overall in terms of how you're growing them in a
responsible way and how you're making sure the oversight in risk management is fine, I mean, because again
externally it seems like everything is going really well, but it's hard to tell. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
We have no concerns over what we're doing in the business. We're not increasing risk in any meaningful way.
We've had strong oversight in that business and we think it continues, and we benefited from business activity,
which is focused on customer flow. We have strong financial risk management in the company and have had that
for a long period of time. We have strong risk management over our trading businesses and controls. And I would
just be really careful to take the source that you're taking and using that to expand into anything beyond from
whence it came. If there's anything meaningful to report, we report it. And as I said, we feel really good about the
progress that we're making and we feel good about the performance of the company. And I think that that stands
on its own.

Very good. And then as a follow-up, I know you gave us some details about the net interest income growth this
year. [indiscernible] (00:58:38) annualize the first quarter results...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A

Hey, Gerard. We lost you there for a second. Can you just repeat the whole second part?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Sure. You gave us some details on the outlook for net interest income growth, up 10%, and if you annualize your
first quarter number, of course, that would be greater than the 10% growth for the full year. And you gave us the
reasons why there's a lot of uncertainty. The one specific question though is, has your thinking on the yield curve
– and I know this is very hard, nobody can predict it where it's going to be. But are you thinking that the yield
curve and maybe a rate cut could be coming sooner and the yield curve comes down when you look at your
outlook? Or has your outlook for the interest rates changed, I guess, is the question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Well, I think certainly the market expectations are implying that there'll be a decrease in the late part of the year
and so I think that's certainly being priced in at the moment. But I do think that you need to be prepared that that's
not going to happen and I think it's possible it doesn't. So I think as we get a little closer, we'll all know.

And what we try to do in our guidance is use what the market's telling us, right. So if that doesn't happen and
rates are higher than what the market's implying, then there would be a little upside there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A

Yeah. And the only thing I'd add is, listen, in all of this, and I tried to say this in our remarks, which is we've said
constantly we don't know what the future holds. We see what the market is saying. Who knows where the market
is right or wrong. You have the Fed Chair who's talking about expect rates higher for longer, and so we're
prepared for a range of scenarios. When we think about giving guidance, we just try and choose a benchmark,
which is the market, which is it's a scenario. And pick your own scenario based upon what you all think, and you
can make your own determination what it'll be. But we're just trying to give you both like a benchmark and what
supports that benchmark, but also be clear that there are a range of alternatives out there which could make the
result differ. Just trying to be as transparent as we can.

Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
No. Appreciate the further insights. That's very helpful. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
Sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: The next question comes from David Long of Raymond James. Your line is open.

David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, everyone. I appreciate all the color on some of the deposit flows, but let me just ask it a little bit
different way. From a non-interest-bearing deposit figure, the number, the percentages has come down. How do
you expect that concentration to change over the course of the next several quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Well, I wouldn't try to predict it exactly over the next couple quarters. But I think if you look at – we're about 32% in
the quarter, and if you go back a number of years pre-pandemic, that was in the mid-20s. And we've said this in
other forums that you could see it start to trend towards there. Will it get down there? Unknown, but I think you'll
see it trend down a little bit more.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Sure. If you look back over, call it, the last 15 years since the great financial crisis, rates have been pretty close to
zero outside of a brief period just before the pandemic. Do you see non-interest-bearing deposits going back to
pre-great-financial-crisis levels for Wells Fargo or the industry where we had numbers there in the mid to high
teens?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
I think that's almost impossible to predict.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: The last question for today will come from Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Kotowski Q
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Yeah. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I guess, I wonder how do you anticipate managing the
duration of your investment securities portfolio from here. I mean, obviously, it must have extended out quite a bit
last year, and we saw the mark-to-marks on it increase across the industry, but I noted kind of the HTM portfolio

was down about 7% during the quarter. And I mean, do you anticipate running that down? And if so, how quickly
does it run down if you do nothing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Well, I think obviously that's going to be a little bit dependent on rates and where rates go, given there's some
mortgage securities in the portfolio in terms of the burn-down. And I think we're going to continue to be thoughtful
as we have in the past around thinking about the size of the portfolio in total, including the AFS, and that's really a
function of a bunch of things, including how much loan growth we expect to see over a period of time. And then
we look at all of the other constraints that we've got to worry about around liquidity and everything else and we
decide on how much goes into HTM and what the makeup of it is. But at this point, we feel comfortable with the
quantum both in terms of the size of the portfolio and the duration of the portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Kotowski Q
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Okay. So you anticipate keeping it roughly this size, all things being equal, or does it run down?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
I think we'll make that decision over time. I don't anticipate the portfolio getting much bigger from here over the
next few quarters, but I think we'll make that decision over time and then the burn-down will be what it is based on
where rates and natural maturities of the portfolio go.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Kotowski Q
Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Okay. Thank you. That's it for me.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Charles William Scharf
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wells Fargo & Co.
All righty, everyone. Thanks so much. Appreciate it, and we'll talk to you soon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael P. Santomassimo
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Wells Fargo & Co.
Take care.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
