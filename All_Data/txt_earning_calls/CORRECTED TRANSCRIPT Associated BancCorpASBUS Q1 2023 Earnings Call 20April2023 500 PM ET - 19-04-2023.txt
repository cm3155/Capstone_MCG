Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Andrew J. Harmening
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, thank you, Shomali, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm Andy Harmening, and
I'm joined here today by Derek Meyer, our Chief Financial Officer; and Pat Ahern, our Chief Credit Officer.
I'd like to start things off by sharing some financial highlights from the quarter and then from there, Derek will walk
through an update on margin, income statement trends, and capital, then Pat will provide an update on credit.
Then in light of the recent turmoil in the banking industry, we've also pulled together some additional information
that underscores the stability of our markets and the durability of our business model.
So while these past five weeks have generated a wide range of headlines about regional banks and financial
service industry in general, we can still say that Associated Bank continues to operate from a position of strength
and it starts with our markets. As the largest bank headquartered in Wisconsin, we've been operating largely in
conservative, diversified Midwest markets for more than 160 years, including metropolitan areas, mid-sized cities,
and small towns. And it's important to note we serve a stable and diversified customer base with deposits from all
banking segments: consumer, high net worth, small businesses, large corporate, government agencies, and
commercial real estate.
And here in the early part of 2023, these markets have remained resilient in the face of an uncertain
macroeconomic environment. Unemployment rates remain stable, with Wisconsin and Minnesota continuing to
come in below the national average. The consumer remains healthy, and our business customers continue to
seek ways to expand and optimize their operations where it makes sense. This backdrop has enabled us to stay
on offense with our initiatives and while I like these initiatives and companies' strategic focus coming into the year,
I like them even more right now.
As we've discussed, our customer and deposit acquisition initiatives began well over a year ago, and over that
time, we've demonstrated an ability to execute as a company. And after delivering the most profitable year in our
company's history in 2022, we've carried that momentum forward in 2023 with several key milestones during the
first quarter.
In February, we launched our new Champion of You brand campaign to support our customer acquisition strategy
with television, radio, and digital ads. The campaign demonstrates our commitment to helping our customers,
communities, and our colleagues become financially stronger.
In March, we launched a new grace zone for the consumer and business accounts that are overdrawn up to $50,
helping our customers when life brings the unexpected challenge. We also continue to build momentum in our
recently launched deposit initiatives such as our digital sales platform, our mass affluent strategies that give us
the ability to attract and deepen more quality customer relationships.
All of these efforts are positioned as to drive positive operating leverage, enhance our profitability, and meet the
needs of our customers' [indiscernible] (04:57). And while we like the progress we've made on our initiatives,
maintaining discipline with regards to credit risk, expense management, and operational risk, that is the
foundation of our company. These foundational strengths will continue to be our focus as we deliver enhanced
value and provide a source of stability for our stakeholders.
So with that, I'd like to highlight the key results for the first quarter on slide 2. Our first quarter results reflected the
continued expansion of our balance sheet, strong profitability, and stable credit impact. Loan balances continue to
grow in each of our major segments but as expected, the pace of that growth has slowed compared to the trends

we saw in the back half of 2022. As we continue to execute our strategic plan and benefit from rising rates, we
once again delivered strong net interest income and net interest margin north of 3%. We also saw a slight
increase in our non-interest income while our expenses declined 5% from the prior quarter. Taken together, these
inputs helped us drive positive operating leverage while delivering PTPP income of $149 million and return on
tangible common equity above 15%.
We are continuing to monitor asset quality closely, but our credit trends in the first quarter remain favorable. We
saw just 5 basis points of net charge-offs during the quarter and added 3 basis points of ACLL. Despite an $18
million provision for the quarter, net income available to common still reflected a 41% increase compared to the
same period a year ago. With that, I'd like to provide a little more detail on our loan trends.
As shown on slide 3, the diversifying impacts of our strategic plan have continued to drive broad, high-quality loan
growth across all major segments. We've now reported growth in nearly every major loan category for four
consecutive quarters. However, this growth has slowed as compared to the strong pace we saw in 2022. This has
been especially true for areas such as auto and CRE.
Nonetheless, we've continued to add balances in consumer verticals such as auto and mortgage and in several of
our commercial businesses. As we've seen over the past couple of quarters, this dynamic is being influenced by
the funding of prior commitments and a slowdown in payoff activity. On an inter-period basis, our mortgage
warehouse business led the way in the first quarter, but we would not expect this trend to continue over the
remainder of the year.
Now, as we've discussed over the past several quarters, one of the benefits of our lending initiatives is that
they've given us more flexibility to drive returns without stretching on credit. This also enabled us to decrease our
reliance on lower yielding non-relationship asset classes. With this in mind, we made the decision to exit the third-
party-originated mortgage business in Q1. This TPO business has historically represented about a third of our
mortgage production, and while the loans have been high-quality, they are lower margin than our retail mortgage
loans, are more susceptible to prepayments and have relatively low relationship value.
Put it in context, we originated approximately $1 billion of these loans in 2022, and we expect originate less than
$100 million in 2023 as we wind down this business to focus on other areas that enable us to optimize returns
over time. Given current market conditions, we now expect total loan growth of between 6% and 8% in 2023.
Shifting to slide 4, we highlight our deposit trends for the first quarter. Clearly, this was a very unique quarter for
the entire industry. With deposits already at a premium in the current rate environment, the events of the past few
weeks have added significant volatility for regional banks across the country. Despite those macro trends, our
core customer deposit balances decreased by less than 1%, and our retail deposits actually increased slightly for
the quarter.
Like most of the industry, we did see some short-term volatility from a subset of uninsured deposits in March, but
those flows have stabilized. We view this as a result of stability and resilience of our markets, the diverse granular
deposit base of our company has cultivated over the course of several decades, and our recent efforts to attract
and deepen customer relationship with digital tools and product enhancements.
On an end of period basis, our total deposits grew 2% compared to the prior quarter and 7% compared to the
same period a year ago. We remain comfortable flexing wholesale network funding levels in the short term, but
we expect to hold this type of funding in check as we move through the year. We remain confident in our ability to

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
fund our growth at a reasonable cost in 2023 and beyond based on our in-flight initiatives. With that said, based
on current market conditions, we now expect to drive total core customer deposit growth of 1% to 3%.
Finally, on slide 5, our team is once again up to deliver strong revenue for the first quarter and when combined
with diligent management of expenses, we've been able to deliver consistent positive operating leverage and
strong PTPP income. In the first quarter, PTPP income of $149 million represented a 67% increase as compared
to the same period a year ago. We remain committed to delivering positive operating leverage during 2023.
With that, I'll hand it over to Derek Meyer, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide further detail on our margin,
income statement, and capital trends for the quarter. Derek?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek Meyer
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Thanks, Andy. Slide 6 highlights our asset sensitivity and liability rate trends throughout the first quarter. Average
earning asset yields, once again, expanded meaningfully in the first quarter due to rising rates and the asset-
sensitive nature of our balance sheet. Versus the fourth quarter of 2021, total earning asset yields have now
increased by 235 basis points or roughly 53% of the increase in Fed funds target rate over the same period.
On the liability side, interest-bearing liability costs have now increased by 221 basis points since the fourth quarter
of 2021 or roughly 50% of the move in Fed funds target. Consistent with the rest of the industry, we've seen the
pace of liability costs continue to increase into the first quarter. This S-curve effect has unfolded largely as
expected, but the pace accelerated in the response to Fed's aggressive actions to fight inflation. We have also
seen betas increase from the success of our efforts to attract and deepen relationships in areas such as
commercial deposits, wealth management, and mass affluent. These deposits often carry a higher beta by nature,
but nonetheless we're pleased with our initial momentum in these businesses.
Moving to slide 7, we continued to deliver strong net interest income in the first quarter, but the number has come
down slightly versus fourth quarter as rising liability costs outpaced rising asset yields during the quarter. As
compared to the fourth quarter, our net interest income decreased by 5%, while our margin compressed by 24
basis points. With that said, our margin profile has transformed significantly over the past 12 months, and we're
taking steps to drive more durable margin over time. As compared to the same period a year ago, our net interest
income increased by 46% in the first quarter and our NIM increased by 65 basis points.
Moving to slide 8, we continue to take gradual steps to lock in a more durable margin profile and reduce our
interest rate risk over time. First, we've taken steps to reduce our interest rate risk by gradually layering in swaps
over the past three quarters. Given ongoing uncertainty around the macroeconomic picture in the near-term rate
environment, we do not intend to call the peak on the interest rate environment in 2023, but we will continue to
take reasonable steps over time to dampen our asset sensitivity and manage our downside risk.
Within our core balance sheet, we've added high-quality liquid securities to take advantage of rising rates. We're
also continuing to manage our deposit costs, while actively working to bolster our funding base of low-cost core
customer relationship deposits. With that said, the macro outlook remains uncertain. Our current expectations
assume one additional 25-basis point Fed funds increase in May, with 225-basis point decreases in September
and November, respectively. Based on our current expectations for balance sheet growth, deposit betas and Fed
action, we now expect net interest income growth of between 13% to 15% in 2023.
On slide 9, we highlight that we continue to build our securities book in the first quarter to align with our 18% to
20% target. Throughout the past year, the yields on our investments have risen steadily with the rate
5

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
environment, but we've reined in durations to reduce our longer-term rate risk. We also reduced exposure to
unrealized losses in AOCI during the quarter. After adjusting our CET1 capital ratio to include the impacts of
AOCI, this impact would have represented an 84-basis point hit to CET1 at year-end. That gap has been reduced
to 71 basis points in March. As a percentage of total assets, we built our investment security and cash positions to
roughly 21% during this quarter. We continue to target investments to total assets of between 18% to 20% in
2023.
Shifting to slide 10, non-interest income grew slightly in the first quarter despite the ongoing pressure from
market-driven headwinds and customer-friendly fee adjustments that we faced for the past several quarters.
Modest increases in mortgage banking income and other fee income reduced other fee-based revenue, offset
reductions in service charges, card-based fees, BOLI income, and capital markets.
Our relative non-interest income growth versus prior quarter was also impacted by a $2 million investment
securities loss recognized in the prior quarter. While non-interest income stabilized quarter-to-quarter, we now
expect total 2023 non-interest income to contract by between 8% and 10% versus 2022. This anticipated
compression is driven by current market dynamics and moderation in deposit account fee income due to
customer-friendly OD and SF changes made in the back half of 2022. These proactive changes give us additional
confidence in our ability to strengthen our low-cost deposit base and enhance our broader profitability profile in
2023 and beyond.
Moving to slide 11, our first quarter expenses came in at $187 million, a 5% decrease versus the prior quarter
despite our ongoing investments in people and technology. Our FTEE efficiency ratio rose slightly from the fourth
quarter, but at 54.6%, it remains more than 9 percentage points lower than the same period a year ago.
Additionally, our non-interest expense decreased 11 basis points as a percent of total assets from prior quarter
and 8 basis points versus the same period a year ago. These proof points underscore our commitment to
maintaining expense discipline as we continue to make progress against our growth strategy.
While we continue to invest in strategies to support these growth aspirations in 2023, we are committed to
keeping expense growth below revenue growth. On an ongoing basis, we will continue to pursue opportunities to
optimize our expense base where possible. With that in mind, we now expect total non-interest expense growth of
approximately 4% in 2023.
Shifting to slide 12, we continue to support the company's growth while managing capital levels towards our target
ranges. Despite recent volatility in the marketplace, our capital ratios grew versus the prior quarter. We also saw a
meaningful increase in our tangible book value per share, driven in part by our enhanced profitability profile. We
remain comfortable with our capital levels as we look out over the remainder of the year. Given current market
conditions and the expectation for short-term rates to remain elevated in the near-term, we continue to expect
TCE to land in the 6.7% to 7.25% range by year-end and CET1 to land between 9% and 9.5%.
I'll now hand it over to our Chief Credit Officer, Pat Ahern, to provide the credit update.

Thanks, Derek. I'd like to start by providing an update on our allowance as shown on slide 13. We've utilized the
Moody's February 2023 baseline forecast for our CECL forward-looking assumptions. The Moody's baseline
forecast remains fairly consistent with recent trends and assumes continued Fed rate action, minimal GDP growth
in the labor market cooling in 2023.

At the end of the first quarter, our ACLL landed at $366 million. This figure represents a $15 million increase from
the prior quarter, largely driven by a combination of portfolio loan growth, nominal credit movement, and general
macroeconomic trends. Accordingly, our reserves to loan ratio increased 3 basis points from 1.22% to 1.25%
during the quarter.
Moving to slide 14, our quarterly credit trends remained stable during the first quarter. We did see non-performing
assets and non-accrual loans increase slightly from the fourth quarter, but both measures are down 18% as
compared to the same period a year ago. Delinquencies decreased on both a whole dollar basis and as a
percentage of total loans as compared to the fourth quarter. After posting a $20 million provision in Q4, we added
another $18 million of provision in the first quarter. As mentioned, this [ph] provisionability (18:57) a function of
loan growth, limited credit movement, and macro trends.
Given recent volatility in the industry, I'd like to take the opportunity to reiterate that the recent growth in our loan
portfolios has been driven by investments in our core business, growth of core relationships, and expanding our
engagement with familiar customer segments. Our experienced team continues to adhere to a disciplined
underwriting culture and proactive approach to portfolio management.
We remain focused on the uncertainty in the macro economy and vigilant with current underwriting reflecting
elevated inflation, supply chain disruption, and labor costs, just to name a few economic concerns. In addition, we
continue to maintain specific attention to monitoring the effects of elevated interest rates on the portfolio, including
ongoing interest rate sensitivity analysis across the bank. Going forward, we expect any provision adjustments to
reflect changes to risk rates, economic condition, loan volumes, and other indications of credit quality.
With that, I will now hand it back to Andy to share some closing thoughts.

Andrew J. Harmening
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Thank you. Look, given recent events in the industry, we have included a few supplemental slides that underscore
the strength and stability of our franchise. First, on page 16, our deposit portfolio is very granular by nature, with a
large percentage of our deposits coming from consumers, small business, and other insured depositors. After
removing collateralized deposits, uninsured deposits represent only 24% of our total base. We have enough
liquidity for 177% coverage of these deposits, and we can access 103% of that coverage as soon as tomorrow
without liquidating any securities.
On the commercial side, no single sector represents more than 10% of our total deposits, with the largest sector
being public municipalities. Additionally, we have no material exposure to the banks in other parts of the country
that have recently failed.
On slide 17, we provide additional information regarding our liquidity sources as of yesterday. As mentioned on
the prior page, we have enough readily available funding to cover 103% of our uninsured, uncollateralized
deposits. But if we include all liquidity sources, that number increases to 177%. In summary, we feel very
comfortable with the levels of uninsured, uncollateralized deposits we have at Associated, and we're also
comfortable with our liquidity levels.
Moving to slide 18, our conservative approach to credit has been honed over the course of the past 12 years, and
we've built a diverse portfolio of high-quality loans across our consumer, business, and corporate customer
bases. CRE is no different. In building our CRE portfolio, we have focused on partnering with well-known
7

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
developers in stable Midwest markets. Approximately 70% of our CRE portfolio is based in the Midwest, with an
emphasis on multi-family and industrial properties.
Office loans represent less than 5% of our total loans as a bank and within that portfolio, we are weighted towards
suburban Class A properties. While we continue to monitor this portfolio closely, we feel well-positioned given our
business model approach and the markets that we operate in.
With that, I'd like to reiterate a couple points from our discussion this afternoon on slide 19. First, remain confident
in our ability to drive balanced loan growth throughout the year but the pace is expected to slow given current
market conditions. With that in mind, we now expect total period end of loan growth between 6% and 8% in 2023.
We're pleased with the initial results of our deposit initiatives and remain confident in our ability to attract and
deepen customer relationships in 2023 and beyond. With that said, based on current market conditions, we now
expect to drive total core customer deposit growth of approximately 1% to 3%.
And while we're taking steps to dampen our asset sensitivity, we expect to continue to benefit from the rising rate
environment in the near-term. Based on our most recent forecast for balance sheet growth, deposit betas, Fed
action, we now expect to deliver net interest income growth of between 13% and 15% in 2023.
And lastly, we continue to invest strategically in people and technology, and we now expect non-interest expense
to grow by approximately 4% in 2023. In fact, we have already taken action to drive to this new target. And as
always, we remain committed to delivering positive operating leverage in future quarters.
With that, Shomali, let's open it up for questions.

Derek Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Oh, are you talking about slide 16, 17?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Okay. Yeah, sure. So what we've done since the end of the quarter really started in the middle of March was
continue to look at ways of getting liquidity just immediately available. And so that we could accelerate any kind of
coverage that we had for any events. And as a result of doing that, we had cut plenty of liquidity coverage
available and this really speaks to it on the next page, on 17, in brokered CDs and we decided to issue brokered
CDs, which is what that deposit growth is and term out our FHLB short-term funding and create secured liquidity
that way be available immediately. So that's what we're trying to capture on those two pages.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Okay. And then when we look at the guidance for the core deposit growth of that 1% to 3%, that implies
obviously a slowdown, a slowdown from here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then in terms of the cost of those, I mean, we should assume that that core beta is still at the higher level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. And to be clear, the 1% to 3% is customer deposits as opposed to net worth or brokered. So it's exclusive
of that and the first quarter, we were just under 1% decrease in customer deposits. We think we'll make that up
and grow in the neighborhood of 1% to 3% for the year.
The other thing I'll mention on those brokered deposits, the way that Derek and our finance team were able to
handle that was really just an opportunity to increase liquidity, but not really have any significant increase in terms
of cost to the bank.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then I guess trying to piece together some of the components of guidance. Does that imply that
quarterly net interest income should be sort of flat from here? I mean, clearly we'll see some margin pressure. But
I mean overall NII, is that sort of flat at these levels or how should we think about that?

Derek Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
I think, well, one, if we look at the size of the drop, we think about 10 basis points of that comes from a mix
change in non-interest-bearing deposits, so if you work through that math. And then we think about 4 or 5 basis
points came from our sub-debt issuance and our securities growth. So probably more of a 10-basis point drop.
There could be additional drop from this quarter based on that continued mix change from non-interest-bearing
deposits. We saw it. It was a few hundred million more than we had planned. We did account for some of it, but I
don't see anywhere near the same magnitude of drop going forward that we saw from fourth quarter to first
quarter. The worst of it's behind us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Were you talking about margin or were you talking about NII?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
I was talking about NIM, margin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yeah, yeah. I was saying NII, so net interest income. Sort of piecing those components together, should we
assume that dollars of net interest income are roughly flat from here for the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. I don't think we've timed it out that specifically.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then maybe just shifting, looking at capital levels, you're in the range of your goals. How should we
think about buybacks through the year here if you're continuing to build capital? Is that something that we should
think about or is it just the environment is too difficult to really say for a bank to be back in buying back stock at
this point?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. We continue to stick to the same priorities we've talked about in all our other calls, which would be
dividend, organic growth, and we're not – our guidance does not contemplate buybacks or acquisitions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. So even with the price pullback, that wouldn't change your thinking on buying back stock?

Daniel Tamayo Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Maybe first, just kind of following up on the net interest income discussion, so
you mentioned that assumes two rate cuts in the back of the year. How would that guidance change if those cuts
weren't in the assumptions? I know they're late in the year, but just curious what that would be if it was just the
May hike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. I think the easiest piece to give you is a 25-basis point rate increase is about $2.5 million a quarter and it's
symmetrical. So, if we don't get it, we would not get compressed by $2.5 million a quarter and you can use that as
a guide.

Okay. All right, helpful. And last, quickly just on the loan growth expectations for the year, I heard you say the
TPO is obviously coming out of that. Is that most of the difference in the loan growth guidance or are you pulling
back in other areas you're seeing lower demand?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. I would say the TPO is really just a small portion of it because what's happened in the mortgage business,
as you may know, is prepayments have slowed significantly. And so we're still seeing growth with significantly
less production. I would say that we've meaningfully tried to – on the auto book, we're trying to make sure that
we're getting a nice yield on those. We've not expanded into new markets at the pace that we had originally
planned. We see a slight decrease in the pipelines in commercial banking as we go throughout the year.
So when you add all those together, I would say TPO's a small piece of it, but I would say it's a general. Some of
the decisions that we've made, some of the more severe underwriting that we have, strategic decisions on
expansion and then some decrease in pipeline on the commercial side year-over-year.

Hi. Maybe just big picture. There's a lot of talk about increased bank regulation after the events of March. What
could that mean for a bank like Associated, kind of $41 billion and growing? Any thoughts there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, I think they showed their hand recently and they're appropriately caring about the granularity of deposits. I
think when you look at where we are, when we have 24% of uninsured and uncollateralized deposits, we feel like
we're in a really good position.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
When you think about liquidity coverage, I think some of the major banks speak to that maybe in a just a little bit
different way versus what's available in 24 hours. Maybe it's within 30 days but I think liquidity coverage is going
to be, of course, important there.
The one thing and I will say from a regulatory standpoint, I feel like the OCC and the Fed from Associated Bank
perspective quickly got in, asked for a lot of details from, I suspect, all of their banks and appropriately so and has
aggregated that. So, learning a lesson from a couple of bank failures is the right approach, an appropriate
approach.
What will come from that in the mid-term and long term, we'll have to wait and see what happens by segment. But
to date, I don't feel as if we've been asked questions that are not appropriate for banking. I suppose that there'll
be an increased focus on asset liability management with an increased focus on deposits. But with regards to the
overall policy change or regulatory changes, it's too early to know what will be formalized.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks for that, Andy. And then as my follow-up, I've noticed the last couple weeks some larger banks are getting
out of the auto floor plan business. Can you just remind me, was that an area you focused on when you joined or
was it more on the auto finance side on the consumer business? And if not, is that an opportunity that would
make sense for Associated?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
We'll review all of – one thing that we've said is we're going to review all of our categories and make sure we can
move towards maximizing returns. We've already made one of those moves in TPO, third-party origination on
mortgage, which really didn't have anything to do with what occurred in the last 30 days as much as the fact that
we have more maturity across all of our lending verticals.
With regards the floor plan, we don't have immediate plans to enter into that. We're not in the floor plan business
today. We are in the indirect auto business. That was initially started, if you might remember, as a hedge against
mortgage volatility. And gosh, I think we've seen a little mortgage volatility.
So it's working as we had hoped. We believe it's significantly better yields than what we'd seen in third-party. So
we like where that had started. But if we see an opportunity in floor plan where there are good yields and good
relationship value and an opportunity for deposits, we would consider it. But we don't have immediate plans to
enter into that.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to clarify on the interest rate
assumptions. Could you restate when the two cuts you expect to occur in the back half of the year are?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
September and November.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Great. And I hear you on the dollar impact but as I think through kind of dynamic balance sheet modeling
just given higher deposit betas and worsening kind of mixes across the industry, is there a possibility where
maybe that second cut is actually maybe beneficial or neutral as it relates to NII and NIM just given that the
second cut might help a little bit more on the deposit cost?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. I'm not sure – that would be a great – it's a very good question and it would be a great case study.
Typically, deposit costs keep going up for another month or two or three after the last hike. So it's not obvious to
me that that would help but I know I ask and if you could immediately take advantage of it with deposit pricing, it
might. But I haven't seen it successfully play out that way before. That being said, I've seen a lot of things this
quarter that I haven't seen before.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
I think that for me, Brody, the real question for our industry is deposit mix shift and that impacts everybody on the
demand deposit side. There's some view that that is a reversion to the norm, that maybe that money went into
there during some of the stimulus and it's coming back out through spend. That's logical and if that is the case, we
would expect that impact to decrease every quarter over the next three, four, five, six quarters until that kind of
has worked its way through the system. I think that is maybe as significant of an impact to margin going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And just one more on the margin front. I guess help me think through the – although this is more on the NII
front with the lower NII guide. I'm assuming it's mostly due to funding and is it a mix of worsening funding mix or
you're also expecting accelerating betas?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
So the guidance contemplates beta that get just about 53%. So those have crept up. We've shared – I think it was
just below 50% in our last one. That's largely driven by mix. Probably the new development in is largely what
Andy's talking about is the mix. It was non-interest-bearing. For us, those were largely stable as a percent of
deposits the last four quarters and there was really much more movement than had been happening in really in
the last quarter. And you put that together with a little bit higher deposit betas and you end up with sort of what
our guidance comes out to be, which is flattish NII quarter to quarter.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And I just had a couple of last ones. Just on the auto book, I just wanted a couple clarifications.
Could you remind me what the – I guess we had to define it by FICO score or prime versus super-prime or
whatever. Like could you help me define where most of those – what most of those – who most of those loans
would be made to from a demographic perspective as it relates to credit score?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
I'm going to start with the easy part then I'm going to turn it over to our expert, Pat Ahern. This is Andy. I believe
about 96% or 97% of these loans would be considered prime or super-prime and if you use our score card model,
we actually believe that 99% of them are. The average FICO in the first quarter, for example, at the time we did
the loan was 772 in the first quarter. So a pretty strong borrowers and that's where we're staying. That's the
neighborhood we expect to live in because typically when you lend to them, they pay you back. And so maybe
give a little more color around that, Pat.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern A
Chief Credit Officer, Executive Vice President & President-Chicago Market, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. I mean, the metrics across, say, the last rolling kind of 12-, 13-month averages have maintained at the
same levels Andy's talking about. I think across the whole portfolio, the FICO is like 755, 760. So that's only
increased this last go round, but we've seen a fair amount of nice stability there and we – like a lot of other lending
areas, we have not stretched to find volume there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. This is just the last one on this and it's something that I'm wondering just about consumers as a whole.
When you underwrite those auto loans, is there any – I guess in the model or in the process, is there any part that
looks at the like the durability or the stability of that borrower's credit score like over a multi-year timeframe? And I
ask just because if you have a marginal bar that might be marginally prime that gets a bunch of cash given to
them from the government, and then they can make 12 months of consistent payments, that really helps the FICO
score when maybe behaviorally they're not necessarily what the FICO score that is at the end of the 12 months
indicates they would be. So is there any kind of like stability to that FICO score given like through time?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. Let me make sure I give my perspective on how a consumer operates. And the way a consumer operates
is if they like to pay, doesn't really matter what their income level is. They pay and so typically what you see, the
consumer can get a little bit more healthy but somebody that is not a payer before they get stimulus doesn't all of
a sudden become a really disciplined consumer. That has not been my experience.
With regards to the durability of the score, that view doesn't exist, to my knowledge. And so when we look at what
it is, we look well beyond just a FICO score. So when we say a balance scorecard, we're looking at multiple
iterations. And what we did, Brody, is we bought data in this when we took over the business and brought in a
team that has been in this business for decades.
So I don't have as big a concern on an inflated FICO, and in short period of time somebody going from sub-prime
or near-prime to prime and super-prime. I just think that'd be a very, very big stretch for that to happen. And I think
15


Associated Banc-Corp
(ASB) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
what's important is that's not the only measurement we're using when we're underwriting this, and that is the
nature of the balance scorecard.

Hey, Jon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Question on slide 4. With some money market, the non-interest-bearing decline, it looks a lot like others. But I'm
just curious how much of that run-off happened after March 8 and I'm specifically looking at the money market
piece of that. Was some of that rate-driven or intentional? I'm just kind of curious what happened kind of pre and
post-March 8.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
I don't have the exact breakdown, but I'll say a couple things here. We did see some uninsured deposits leave the
bank and our numbers surely would have looked different on core customers had Silicon Valley Bank – had the
failures not occurred. So that's one thing.
16


Associated Banc-Corp
(ASB) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
The second piece – but it's not crazy numbers for us. And what I would say, though, still is there is a mix shift that
is going on that was happening before Silicon Valley Bank. And to be clear, it's happening in our industry. It is not
– it's not unique to Associated. It's, in my opinion, across the board. It's a consumer behavior.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. I guess maybe another way to get at this if – we're sitting here in 90 days. Does slide 4 look similar, just
perhaps not as amplified? Is that fair?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
It would make me sad if it looked the same because I just told you that I thought we were going to grow deposits
for the year. So, well, it looks somewhat similar. Let me take a pause on that. Maybe with the – I was going to say
similar with different numbers, the magnitude of the loss we wouldn't think would be as significant. The challenge
on non-interest-bearing, we think, at some level will stay the same. So the mix could be similar, but just not to
such exaggerated dollars, if that makes sense.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And then how about just bigger picture, more on slide 3, loan growth drivers from here. It
sounds like you're saying commercial's a little bit slower. Maybe some of it's self-imposed. Maybe the pipelines
have changed a bit, but how about slide 3? How does that look as the year progresses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. We think mortgage warehouse, if you look at that and you look back and there's a table in the back that
shows average deposit, that just spiked at the end of the quarter. We don't expect that to be a similar phenomena
the rest of the year. So that is not a high growth. That would be surprising to me and so that something changes
wildly with interest rates, that that would be a primary grower for us.
We'd expect the modest growth in mortgage, although we're out of the TPO unless again there's a large change
in interest rates for the refinance like it booms this year, which we don't anticipate. We wouldn't see a large
retrench there. We would think that there would be steady growth in the commercial part of our business and I'm
not so sure that that REIT approach would change. So there'd be a little bit of them and we'll have steady growth
in the auto finance, assuming that we can continue to lend to high-quality borrowers at a good yield.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And then just one more on the expense growth guidance. You talked about already taking some actions to
get to that lower growth level. Can you give us some examples of what you're doing and then also where you feel
it's necessary to spend money? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. Sure. So one thing that I've said is that we go into each year with a plan for growth and then we would be
immediately ready and willing to pull levers on the expense side if we didn't see that growth emerging. So we
17


Associated Banc-Corp
(ASB) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2023 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2023
have a decent amount of growth, but not to what I thought was the upper range of that. One thing we did is we
pulled the lever on third-party origination, but we also recognized where our mortgage volume was overall and we
decreased our staffing, both contractors and FTE in that category.
Then we looked at the rest of the year and we looked at where strategic adds were being made and what were
necessary in this environment. And we put a process in place that requires it to go through quite a process to add
any of those people, including up to our CFO having to sign off on that. And trust me, when Derek doesn't just
sign when he sees it, he has a discussion about that.
So that will slow any strategic adds that we might have had. And then we look at the areas that we think are going
to thrive going into the end of the year and into next year and we will continue to add quality people in those
places. But net-net, we won't necessarily replace every role that comes in. We won't add some of them that were
planned. We've reduced lines of business and then, frankly, we'll set up a much more thorough process in the
next two to three weeks to start to look across our company heading into 2024 as to what we should look like
then.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Good, Andrew.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Leischner Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
So looks like the quarterly provision has been a little under $20 million in the last three quarters. Is that a good run
rate going forward? Do you expect that to ramp up given the macro uncertainty? And also, if you can provide any
insight on where you expect to see reserve levels go, that would be great. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern A
Chief Credit Officer, Executive Vice President & President-Chicago Market, Associated Banc-Corp
I would say, well, probably I could see provision increasing from here. We've come off such a small level, but it's
hard to say what that's going to be. We're going to continue to monitor loan growth, where the markets are going
from a macro level, but then more importantly, our individual credits in the portfolio.
We've just gone through a complete deep dive across the full commercial bank, including C&I and CRE, and we
really did not find any significant movements in risk rating changes where there were no surprises that came out
of stuff and we'll continue to do that on a quarterly basis. That being said, if we see continued pressure or
probability of recession later in the year going into 2024, we'll monitor that and make appropriate adjustments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Andrew, I think it's also important to remember that when you decrease your growth with the CECL methodology,
you don't have as immediate of impact on your level. We've taken qualitative downturn factors and increased
those in our model. And then – so that's already been occurring.
And then finally, we do believe that the market will slowly have some level of deterioration at some point, but we
are not anticipating wild swings with the nature of our portfolio. And remember, we're in the upper Midwest and
what that means is the real estate isn't quite as volatile. And that's sometimes an area where you see volatility. So
we're not immune to macroeconomic impacts, but we think it would be more of a slow build as we go throughout
the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Leischner Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. Great. Thanks. That was really helpful. And so with your loan deposit ratio at 96% at quarter end, and I

going?

You want to answer this one? This one Derek likes or I'll take it because I like it, too.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Derek Meyer A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
I don't want to get in your way. I'll clean up anything you miss.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew J. Harmening A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Wow. Okay. Fair enough. Look, we're pretty comfortable staying around that 95% area. As loan demand and
growth decreases, our goal is to try to fund that with our deposit growth. In the instances we're not afraid to flex on
the wholesale, but we have multiple initiatives, I mean when we think about the digital sales platform, when we
think about our mass affluent, when we think now we're the 13th largest HSA business in the country and we are
forecasting double-digit growth there, when we think that we have more RMs and if they are not lending, they sure
as heck should be talking about primary relationships. And we have double-digit increases in our treasury
management sales.
So we have a lot of reasons to believe that we can outpace the market when it comes to deposit growth. We just
have to execute. First quarter was a noisy market for our industry, but we still believe that we're in a position to
grow our deposits. We would like to stay in that 95% range. Our initiatives will continue to have a focus on holistic
relationship and deposits. We started a new branding campaign and we've already gotten early results.
And I guess the other thing that gives me some optimism is that our primary customers were consumer and
businesses even with the noise in the first quarter. They still had positive growth. They had marginal positive
growth but we're just getting started in many of these consumer initiatives. So you asked a simple question. I gave
you a complicated answer because it's not simple. But the short answer would have been I'm comfortable at the
95% range. We'd like to fund that with customer growth as opposed to wholesale or net worth growth. But we're
comfortable in the short-term because we believe in those initiatives, using those levers as long as it's profitable.
