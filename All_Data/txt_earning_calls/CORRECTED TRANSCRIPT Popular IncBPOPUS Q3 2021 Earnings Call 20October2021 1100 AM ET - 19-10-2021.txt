MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Hello, everyone, and welcome to the Popular, Inc. Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. My name is
Bethany, and I'll be coordinating this call for you today. [Operator Instructions]
I will now hand the call over to your host, Paul Cardillo, Investor Relations Officer at Popular. Over to you, Paul.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul J. Cardillo
Investor Relations Officer, Popular, Inc.
Good morning, and thank you for joining us, and also for your patience as we dealt with some connectivity issues.

They will review our results for the third quarter and then answer your questions. Other members of our
management team will also be available during the Q&A session.
Before we start, I would like to remind you that on today's call, we may make forward-looking statements that are
based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press
release and are detailed in our SEC filings. You may find today's press release and our SEC filings on our
webpage at Popular.com.
I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Ignacio Alvarez.

President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Good morning, and thank you for joining the call. The third quarter was another strong one, in which we achieved
net income of $248 million. Our results reflect the continued strength in economic activity, driven by the
2

unprecedented levels of federal stimulus. They also reflect our diversified sources of revenue and prudent risk
management.
Please turn to slide 3. Our quarterly net income of $248 million was $30 million higher than the second quarter
and $80 million higher than the same quarter of 2020. The sequential variance was driven by a higher benefit in
the provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher expenses.
Net interest income was in line with the second quarter. Our non-interest income increased primarily due to the
sale of two corporate office buildings. Our higher volume of credit and debit card transactions in the quarter also
contributed to the increase. Credit quality trends continued to be favorable in the period with lower NPLs and low
levels of net charge-offs.
During the quarter, we continued to return capital to our shareholders. On September 9, we completed the
previously announced $350 million accelerated share repurchase program. And on September 30, we announced
the redemption of our 6.7% trust preferred securities, of which $187 million is currently outstanding. These actions
evidence the strength of our capital position, which allows us to return capital to our shareholders while we
continue to invest in our franchise.
Please turn to slide 4. On October 15, we acquired K2 Capital Group, a national healthcare equipment leasing
business with $119 million in assets. This transaction will complement and expand our existing niche healthcare
lending business.
Our customer base in Puerto Rico continues to grow, increasing by 12,000 in the third quarter and by nearly
42,000 year-to-date to reach more than 1.9 million unique customers. Adoption of digital channels among our
retail customers continues to be strong. Active users on our Mi Banco platform exceed 1.1 million and had grown
by 18% since March 2020. We captured 66% of our deposits in the third quarter through digital channels. As
expected, these trends have adjusted slightly lower but remained significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels.
Within Popular's clientele, the dollar value of credit and debit card sales have continued to trend higher,
increasing by 5% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Sales are also well above pre-pandemic levels, 34%
higher than in the third quarter of 2019. Auto loan and lease originations at BPPR have remained extremely
strong. While they had decreased slightly compared to the third quarter in 2020, which reflected the reopening of
the economy, they were 26% higher versus the third quarter in 2019.
We have continued to see strength in the housing market. While the dollar value of mortgage originations at
BPPR decreased by 3% compared to the third quarter 2020, they increased by 51% compared to the third quarter
of 2019.
Please turn to slide 5 for an update on the current macro environment in Puerto Rico. In the third quarter,
business trends and customer activity remained robust. We continue to see strong momentum in recent quarters
as most of the COVID-related restrictions that were in place have either been relaxed or eliminated.
Puerto Rico has continued to make solid progress on the vaccination front, and we are proud to say that we have
the highest vaccination rate of any US state or territory. According to the CDC website, 81 % of the population
over 12-years-old, have been fully vaccinated and 90% have received at least one dose of the vaccine.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
New auto sales continue to reflect strong consumer demand and are on a record pace with 31,000 units sold in
the third quarter. Year-to-date, auto sales are up 66%, compared to the first nine months of 2020 and are up 32%
from the same period in 2019.
Cement sales have also remained strong. Year-to-date sales through August were higher than the level of sales
seen through the same periods in 2018 and 2019, when the island was rebuilding following the 2017 hurricane.
Activity levels in the tourism and hospitality sector have continued to be a source of strength for the local
economy. With much of world travel still somewhat limited, Puerto Rico continues to be a Popular destination for
mainland residents.
Hotel demand remained strong during the quarter. In August, occupancy rates in Puerto Rico have exceeded a
comparable period in 2019, for the fourth consecutive month. Airport traffic has continued to improve. Year-to-
date passenger traffic has more than doubled compared to last year and has now exceeded comparable 2019
levels.
In September, traffic was up 130% compared to the same month a year ago and was 20% higher than in
September of 2019. This was the sixth consecutive month that passenger traffic has surpassed the comparable
figures in 2019. Cruise ship arrivals recommenced in August. According to the Puerto Rico Tourism Company,
more than 300 trips are anticipated for the remainder of the 2021-2022 season.
Employment levels have improved, but are still somewhat below pre-pandemic levels. Total non-farm employment
has increased by 3% since December 2020, and by 1% since August 2020. We are pleased with the results for
the third quarter and continue to be optimistic about the prospects for the future. However, we will remain
attentive to how the evolving health situation may impact the economy.
I will now turn the call over to Carlos for more detail on our financial results.

Carlos J. Vázquez
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Ignacio. Good morning. Please turn to slide 6. As usual, additional information is provided in the
Appendix to the slide deck. Today's earnings press release detailed variances from the second quarter.
Net interest income for the third quarter was $489 million, an increase of $2 million from Q2. Non-interest income
increased by $15 million to $169 million in Q3. Around $12 million of the increase came from extraordinary items,
including a $7 million gain associated with the sale and leaseback of two corporate buildings, plus $3 million
higher net earnings from investments held under the equity method, along with other smaller positive variances.
The provision for the second quarter was a benefit of $61 million. This was $44 million higher than the benefit
recorded in the second quarter. Lidio will expand on credit-related matters.
Total operating expenses were $388 million in the quarter, an increase of $20 million from Q2. This increase was
primarily due to higher employee compensation cost by $3 million, mostly driven by annual merit increases,
higher professional fees by $4 million, a lower OREO gain by $3 million, plus smaller increases in other
categories like FDIC deposit cost and business promotion. Higher credit and debit card transactions also drove a
$2 million increase in related expenses.
For the fourth quarter, we expect expenses to be between $405 million and $410 million. This is consistent with
our guidance for average quarterly expenses in 2021 to be between $380 million and $385 million. Obviously, if
4

possible, we will try to improve on this number. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25%, the same as last
quarter. In Q4, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 25% and 28%.
Please turn to slide 7. NII on a taxable equivalent basis was $536 million, $5 million lower than in the second
quarter. The primary driver for this decrease was lower investment portfolio interest income by $7.7 million, due to
lower yields, which was partially offset by $1.5 million higher interest income from loans and lower deposit costs
by $1.1 million. A lower mix of exempt income also contributed to this outcome.
Deposits grew by $1.4 billion in the quarter. Most of the growth was at BPPR, with a $700 million increase in
Puerto Rico government deposits and a $500 million increase in our retail and commercial deposits. Net interest
margin decreased by 14 basis points to 2.77% in Q3. On a taxable equivalent basis, NIM was 3.04%, a decrease
of 18 basis points. The lower margin was due to higher balances of low-yielding money market and investment
securities.
Total loan yields increased by 2 basis points in Q3, a result of higher PPP related income of $22 million,
compared to $14 million in the second quarter. PPP loans yielded approximately 10.1% compared to 4.45% last
quarter, due to higher accelerated recognition of fee income upon forgiveness.
Year-to-date, we have recognized $59 million in income from this program. The remaining unamortized portion of
fees for the PPP portfolio is approximately $40 million, of which we expect to recognize half in Q4 and the
remainder in the first half of 2022.
As of the end of the third quarter, Puerto Rico public deposits were roughly $20 billion, an increase of $700 million
from last quarter. We continue to expect public deposit balances to come down over time, driven by the
restructuring of public sector debt and the return to current debt service.
Our ending loan balances decreased by $201 million in the quarter. This decline was due to a [ph] $354 million
(12:11) decrease in PPP loans and a $140 million runoff in our residential mortgage portfolio. Excluding the
impact of PPP, loan balances grew by $153 million, driven by higher commercial auto loan and lease balances in
Puerto Rico. These increases were offset in part by lower commercial balances in the US, driven by higher pre-
payments. We do not expect overall loan growth to materialize until the middle of next year when demand
resulting from expected economic growth should outpace the forgiveness of PPP loans.
Please turn to slide 8. Our common equity tier-1 ratio in Q3 was 17.4%, an increase of 80 basis points from Q2,
primarily due to net income. On September 9, the corporation completed the previously announced ASR and, in
total, we purchased approximately 4.6 million shares at an average purchase price of $75.84.
Additionally, last month, we announced the redemption of the $187 million outstanding balance of our 6.7% trust
preferred securities to be executed in Q4, which will result in reduced annual interest expense of $12 million.
Tangible book value increased by $2.77 per share to $66.01. This increase was primarily driven by our quarterly
net income and partially offset by dividends and lower accumulated unrealized gains on investments. Our return
on tangible equity was 19.4% in the third quarter.
In summary, during 2021, we have repurchased $350 million in common stock, increased our quarterly dividend
by $0.05 per share to $0.45 per share, redeemed $187 million in high Trust Prefs. And on October 15, we
acquired a national healthcare equipment leasing business for $155 million in cash.

We have also returned to our normal capital planning schedule, which should result in an announcement of
Popular's 2022 capital actions no later than January 2022 webcast.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Lidio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano
Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Carlos. And good morning. During the third quarter, the corporation continued to exhibit strong credit
quality metrics and low credit costs, driven by the improving economic environment.
Please turn to slide number 9 to discuss credit metrics. Non-performing assets decreased by $57 million to $710
million this quarter, mainly driven by an NPL decrease of $52 million, coupled with a decrease of $9 million in non-
performing loans held for sale. Offset in part by an increase of $4 million [ph] through (15:05) other real estate
owned.
In Puerto Rico, NPLs decreased by $48 million, mainly due to lower commercial NPLs of $34 million. This was
due to payments received and charges taken on collateral dependent loans, coupled with lower mortgage NPLs
of $16 million, resulting from lower inflows and continued improvement in the credit profile of the portfolio.
In the US, NPLs decreased by $4 million, mostly related to a commercial loan payoff. The $9 million decrease in
NPLs held for sale was mainly due to loan sales. The ratio of NPLs to total loans held in portfolio was 2.2%
compared to 2.4% in the prior quarter.
Please turn to slide 10 to discuss NPL inflows. Compared to the second quarter, NPL inflows excluding consumer
loan decreased by $44 million, driven by a decrease of $37 million in Puerto Rico as the prior quarter included the
inflow of a $32 million commercial relationship coupled with a decrease of $5 million in mortgage NPL inflows. In
the US, NPL inflows decreased by $7 million, mainly due to lower commercial inflows.
Turning to slide number 11, net charge-offs amounted to $10.1 million or an annualized 12 basis points of
average loans held in portfolio, compared to a net recovery of $1.3 million or negative 2-basis point in the
previous quarter The quarter-over-quarter comparison was impacted by the recovery in the prior quarter of a $7.9
million commercial relationship in Puerto Rico.
Excluding this, the net charge-off ratio would have been flat quarter-over-quarter, 12-basis point versus 9 basis
points. Net charge-offs continue to be significantly below pre-pandemic levels. Our allowance for credit losses
decreased by $67 million or 8.6% to $719 million, driven mainly by improvements in the economic scenarios and
credit quality as we will discuss in the following slide.
The ratio of allowance for credit losses to loans held in portfolio decreased to 2.49% from 2.70% in the prior
quarter. Excluding PPP loans and guarantee mortgage loans, this ratio is 2.74%. The ratio of allowance for credit
losses to NPLs held-in-portfolio was 114%, flat from the prior quarter.
Please turn to slide number 12 to discuss details on the drivers of the variance in allowance for credit losses. As
we previously mentioned, the allowance for credit losses decreased by $67 million when compared to the
previous quarter. Variances were driven by changes to qualitative reserves and economic outlook as well as
portfolio credit quality and mix. While a strong recovery is evident, we also consider more adverse outcomes
given uncertainties around the impact of new virus strains and the Puerto Rico government's ability to utilize the
available federal assistance.

As a result, we continue to assign the highest probability to the baseline scenario, followed by the more
pessimistic S3 scenario. Our macroeconomic forecast uses a number of economic variables with the
unemployment rate and GDP being the largest drivers. The current baseline scenario expectations for 2022 GDP
growth and the unemployment rate expectation are flat quarter-over-quarter.
However, Moody's analytics revisions to certain income-related variables in Puerto Rico contributed to a $17
million decrease in the allowance for credit losses. During the quarter, we released $50 million from our qualitative
reserve prompted by the economic environment and improvements in the outlook for the US [ph] CRE (19:41)
portfolio. Total portfolio changes, particularly in the Puerto Rico commercial and auto loan portfolio caused the
ACL to decrease by $24 million. Portfolio changes includes fluctuations in credit quality, volume, and mix.
To summarize, our loan portfolio exhibited improved credit quality metrics during the third quarter with net charge-
off activity significantly below pre-pandemic levels. We will continue to monitor the exposure of the portfolios to
pandemic-related risks and changes in the economic outlook.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ignacio for his concluding remarks.

Ignacio Alvarez
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Lidio and Carlos, for your updates. Our results in 2021 to date have been strong, driven by solid
earnings, improved credit quality, record deposit levels, continued customer growth and the successful execution
of our capital actions. We are optimistic about the economic outlook. In addition to the unprecedented level of
federal stimulus related to COVID, Puerto Rico still has a significant amount of hurricane recovery funds that have
yet to be disbursed, which we expect will now start flowing at a faster pace.
The combined impact to these factors and continued consumer spending should generate considerable economic
activity in many sectors for the coming years, and we are well-positioned to benefit from such activity. A
successful resolution of the debt situation in Puerto Rico would also be a positive factor. And last, but certainly not
least, we're looking forward to having the entire team together in our offices again.
Given progress in the vaccination process, a general improvement in health conditions in our markets and sound
safety protocols in our facilities, we have begun to bring back to the office our colleagues that were still working
remotely. The managers and supervisors returned earlier this month and the remainder of our workforce will
return in early November.
We are entering the homestretch of 2021. Despite all those challenges, this has been a great year thus far with
solid results and significant accomplishments. Our team is energized and committed to ending the year on a
strong footing.
We are now ready to answer your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Brock Vandervliet of UBS. Brock, your line is
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Oh, thanks. Thanks very much. I did manage to get in the queue. If you could just start in terms of core loan
growth expectations, I understand overall loan growth is going to take a while to overcome the PPP paydown
headwinds which you already outlined. But how should we think about core loan growth over the next couple of
quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Well, this is Ignacio. I think, we got to look at it a little bit sector-by-sector over the next quarters. I mean, besides
PPP, we have a large mortgage loan book in the US, which is paying down, about 150...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Puerto Rico. Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
...Puerto Rico. So – but I think we expect to see continued loan growth in auto, and the commercial sector looks
very strong also. So those are sectors that we expect to see growth.
In the commercial, we expect to see growth both, in Puerto Rico and in the US. In the US, this quarter we had a
lot of paydowns from the construction portfolio especially, but I think you'll see sectors like auto and commercial
be coming up sooner. Overall, we continue to say as I think Carlos mentioned in his prepared remarks that
overall, when you look at the overall loan balance, probably won't see a significant net growth until the second half
of next year. Carlos, you want to add something...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah. No, Brock. I mean, we're pretty pleased that ex-PPP, both last quarter and this quarter, our loans
grew. So, our commentary on net growth is just the fact that in the fourth quarter, it's roughly half of our remaining
PPP portfolio that's forgiven. And we have similar runoff in our [ph] resi portfolio about (24:02), $0.5 billion of loan.
So, we started minus $500 million already.
And in the first half of next year, if the other half of our PPP portfolio is forgiven, which we expect and then
mortgage runoff doesn't change, then we start at minus $600 million for the first half of next year. So that is what
leads the math. But, in general, we're pretty happy that ex-PPP, both last quarter and this quarter, we had net
loan growth.

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And just separately on capital, I noticed you bought the leasing business, not a terribly large acquisition, but
certainly material given that purchase price you're continuing to build capital, reserves look ample given the credit
contours. How should we think about capital allocation?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
I mean, we keep trying to touch all the buttons or pull all the levers, whichever way you want to address or think
about it. This year, I think we have successfully done so. We saw all the different ways in which we can manage
capital that have been put to use. And that will hopefully continue to be the way we operate in the future. We're in
the middle of our capital plans for 2022 now. Again, we are hopeful that we'll have an announcement by the
webcast in in January. But in general, given our levels of capital, we will probably have to continue to pull all the
levers to achieve what we want to do, which is over time to move our capital levels in the direction of our US
peers plus some cushion.

Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yes. Sorry about that. Wanted to just start off a little bit more on this K2 acquisition. Initially, it seems like kind of
small potatoes in terms of the net assets being acquired. But just looking at the purchase price certainly leads me
to the suspicion that maybe this is actually a pretty good loan-generating engine. And I was hoping that you could
expand a little bit more on sort of what kind of origination capabilities this platform has and how it's going to sort of
fit into the overall model?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Well, I don't have the numbers exactly in the projection of originations, but I can tell you that it's – when we look in
the states, we've said before we're looking for niche businesses that can complement our existing businesses.
And this is a healthcare equipment leasing company, which we think really fits well and strategically complements
our national healthcare lending business. So, we think that we like the people behind K2. We think they have a
good business. But we think that the synergies that we can create with healthcare business are important. And we
hope to try to make into a national platform the same way we've done with [ph] PAB (27:50) in our healthcare
vertical.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q

Can you talk a little bit more on sort of what type of loans these are and what kind of yields that we expect to
replace the cash with?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. The loans are basically, mostly finance leases of medical equipment like machines that you put in
healthcare centers. So, just generally, healthcare, X-ray machines or other types of – what's that?

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. I don't have the number on the yield, either, Alex. But I mean if when all the acquisition noise comes out
and everything normalizes, call it in 2023, we expect it to contribute about high-single-digit millions to net income
every year and hopefully grow. As Ignacio said, one part of the beauty of this is that, not only does it add an
10

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
important product for healthcare clients it also makes our existing healthcare offering more competitive. So, part
of the benefit of this acquisition will not be in the subsidiary itself. It will actually be part of Popular Bank.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then just in terms of the, sort of – when you do a deal like this and the regulatory process, this one is
relatively small, but I imagine it does play a role in sort of the – sort of overall capital allocation from a regulatory
standpoint. Do you have to go through the same process as you do with the buyback and the dividend?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. The regulatory system is quite complex. Let's not call it [indiscernible] (29:43) but it's quite complex. So,
depending how you do an acquisition, it depends how you have to go through different regulatory structures. This
case since we're doing it through a subsidiary of Popular Bank. In fact, we only have to go to the New York DFS.
So, it was a relatively simple, straightforward process. I don't think it would be material enough for example, the
Fed when we're looking at our capital plan. Obviously, they look at everything we do, but I don't think it's going to
move the needle one way or the other in the capital plan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then just another question on the bankruptcy, you sort of alluded to the end being kind of within sight.
It's a little bit hard, I think sometimes for a lot of investors and for me to kind of boil through some of the headlines.
But it seems like they're getting pretty close to a deal between the board and the bondholders. And it seems like
the government may have gotten what they wanted with the pension scheme. Can you just help us understand
exactly where we are in that process?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. Well, we're actually in a critical stage as you're up-to-date. So, there was negotiations going back and forth
and both, the executive branch and the legislative branch had basically said that they weren't going to sign off on
any deal that had cuts to the existing pension. And there was also controversy regarding the amounts that will be
budgeted to support the public university, the UPR.
They went back and forth in a couple of rounds and there appears to be an agreement in principle regarding that
the [indiscernible] (31:21) would present a plan of adjustment with zero cuts to the pension and with at least $500
million for the UPR.
Yesterday, the House of Representatives voted on legislation to support that plan of adjustment. One of the
technical issues is that the plan of adjustment contemplated exchange of new bonds for existing bonds. And
there's a debate whether that has to go through the legislature or not. So, yesterday, the House approved it. They
are still a bit short in the Senate. Apparently, some of the Senators are not convinced that the language regarding
no pension cuts is ironclad. So, I think the Senate is scheduled to take this up on Thursday again. But you're right,
we're very close. The House did pass the enabling legislation and now we're waiting on the Senate. The Governor
has said he will sign the legislation. So, really, it requires the Senate to approve it.
The Senate is a very difficult situation in Puerto Rico, because no party has an absolute majority. The party has –
the President of the Senate has a plurality, but they don't have it. So it requires more horse trading than usual.

Popular, Inc.

And so, we're really down to the ninth hour whether this gets approved by the Senate. It could happen as early as
Thursday. If that doesn't happen, then we have to go back and renegotiate something. I'm hopeful it'll happen on
Thursday, but we'll have to wait and see.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
So if that does happen on Thursday, then the presumption is that the bankruptcy, you'll be able to exit bankruptcy
at some point by the end of this year. And then just remind us how much of public deposits – I think in the past,
you said somewhere around $10 billion to $11 billion that sits on Popular's balance sheet would flow out directly
related to that bankruptcy. Is that correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. That's our best estimate. Of course, the government has not told us exactly. We hold most of the public
funds, but there are other financial institutions that have public funds, including local institution including city, so –
but that's our best estimate, yes. And the process would be, if this enabling legislation is passed, the plan of
adjustment will be considered by the court and it's up to the court to approve or disapprove the plan of
adjustment. Theoretically, they could disapprove it. We – I don't think that given all the work that's gone through
this, I think that's not a likely result. So, hopefully, we will have something by the end of the year, in which case,
I'm not clear how soon the money will go out, but it will go out relatively soon thereafter, because it's a cash down
payment, so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And in terms of the financial impact to you guys, if I'm remembering correctly, it's not, I think the language
is not material to NII, but certainly would help the NIM, TCE, and ROA. Is that correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
That is correct. In the existing level of interest rate environment, it is not material to NII, and it would – yeah, it will,
obviously, be very significant to our margin. Our margin has basically been driven by this sole factor for the last
four or five quarters. So, our margin will return to be more linked to our core business than it has been for the last
year plus.

open.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you. Good morning, Ignacio and Carlos.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Maybe this question – we can start off with Lidio, if he's still there on credit. Obviously, net charge-offs for you
folks were very low in the quarter and granted they were up slightly from the positive number that you had in the
prior quarter. But in the industry, it's experiencing incredibly low net charge-offs in – at this part of the cycle. Can
you give us an – what you think may happen in terms of how long can these low levels remain, and do we start to
see some sort of normalization in net charge-offs by the end of next year into 2023, which still will be lower than a
bad period, but I would think that they eventually have to start creeping up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer, Popular, Inc.
I'll give you my perspective, I mean, prior to the pandemic, if you look over sort of three, five-year periods, the
charge-offs for Popular were between – corridor between 75-basis point to 125-basis point. Since the pandemic,
we have been significantly, as you mentioned, lower than that, including a net benefit in the prior quarter.
When you look at NPL formation, when you look at early delinquency, so just – at least for the short-term, that will
continue to be the case. And I think a lot of it is going to be dependent upon economic performance and the pace
of the [ph] federal system (36:40) that Carlos and Ignacio alluded to in the prepared remarks, but we expect to
come to Puerto Rico. So, if that were to happen and we continue to see the level of economic activity, that might
last a little bit, but I agree with you also that at some point in time, things will normalize in the future.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. Ignacio and Carlos, obviously, you announced this acquisition recently and you're putting your cash to
work and you've done other deals similar like the Wells Fargo Automobile portfolio in their business a couple of
years back, I guess. Are there any other opportunities for you folks to put your excess capital to work in
acquisitions whether it's a non-depository or even a depository somewhere in the mainland?

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
Yeah. We have traditionally been opportunistic buyers of assets, and we continue to be so. And so, people bring
opportunities to us and we review them. This K2 seemed like a very nice fit to bolt-on. It complements our
healthcare vertical, which is doing very well and we think has great potential for the future given the demographics
of the country, right?
So, we will continue to look for those kinds of unique opportunity just like Reliable. We like the auto sector and it
was there and it came across. I have said before that, especially bank acquisition is not our focus in the near-
future. But we are opportunistic that when things present themselves, we look at especially acquisitions of things
that complement our existing businesses. So, I think our overall strategy hasn't changed. K2 came around. We
looked at it carefully. We thought it fit perfectly with our existing strategy. So, we executed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then just as a follow-up, I know you need to keep a certain amount of cash on the balance sheet
when the government finally draws down those excess deposits from your organization. But Carlos, when you
look out, when do you think you may want to start to lengthen the duration of maybe some of those cash assets
into longer-term securities?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Well, given that rates are finally seem to be going up in time, investment returns seem to starting to go up. We are
looking at that more closely now. Again, as you know, Gerard, I have – it pains me significantly to extend duration
to 7 to 10 years to get a yield of [ph] 130 (39:35) or something like that. Now, we're in the [ph] 160s (39:39). So it's
becoming more interesting. So this is the job of our ALCO Committee. We look at this every week. We did extend
– we did increase our investment portfolio by about $2 billion this quarter. So, we do it selectively when we think
there's good opportunities to extend.
Again, as rates move up, our willingness to extend will move up accordingly. So, are we rushing through the
door? No. Are we taking a good look at the door right now? Yes. We are.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then, just – and I apologize, I should know this, but do you have a swaps book or – and if you do,
is it growing? Are you looking to add to it? Some of your peers are doing that now in this period of their outlook for
rates.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
No. We don't have a swaps book, Gerard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Very good. Okay. Thank you.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 20-Oct-2021
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: We have a follow-up question from Brock Vandervliet of UBS. Brock, your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thank you. It's just going back to some of the credit questions. I think everyone kind of focuses on charge-offs
and the reserve level. But as we look at NPLs, and they've been down consistently and they were down
substantially in Puerto Rico, $48 million this quarter, why couldn't that drop far more meaningfully or are there sort
of structural NPLs that we shouldn't expect to see go away? It just seems like with the economic trajectory, the
structurally high level of problem assets that we've seen for years, because Puerto Rico is in a recession should
drop pretty hard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Paul, do you want to take that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul J. Cardillo A
Investor Relations Officer, Popular, Inc.
Sure. I can try. When you look at NPLs in Puerto Rico, and the mix of NPLs over time is, mostly mortgage-related
NPLs. That takes a little bit longer to resolve than maybe some other type of NPLs. So that leads you to what you
maybe call structural NPLs. I mean, that's going to take a longer time for it to work throughout and more so over
the last – since the pandemic, because there have been lack of foreclosures and NPLs – mortgage NPLs have
actually not decreased as fast as other type of NPLs in the cycle – in this part of the cycle. So I think that is what
is driving the many higher levels of NPLs that you see in Puerto Rico.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And just on expenses, a number of the major banks have called out, and it's not unique to banks and just
greater expense pressure, difficulty in hiring, that general theme, is that something we should also be aware of
within your business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yes. I mean, we're not immune to the situation. The hiring situation has become much more difficult. There are
salary pressures. In Puerto Rico, we still have an advantage against some of our main peers, but we are seeing
salary inflation in Puerto Rico as you get competition from all kinds of sectors. So that's something that we can
anticipate we will continue. We made some salary increases at July as you've seen.
We're going to be reviewing our minimum wage like everyone else is. So these are – this is a – we have
somewhat of a beneficial position in Puerto Rico, but we're subject to the same trends. We're subject to the same
trends.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Understood. Okay. Thank you for the follow-ups.
