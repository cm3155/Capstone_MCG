Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Gregory D. Carmichael
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. Hope you are all well and staying healthy.
Earlier today, we reported first quarter net income of $694 million or $0.93 per share. We continued our positive
momentum from the past several quarters and, once again, delivered strong financial results in the first quarter.
These strong results reflect record commercial banking fee revenue, continued success generating consumer
household growth, and a strong underlying net interest margin.
Our performance reflects focused execution on our key strategic priorities. We continue to benefit from the
diversification and resilience of our fee-based businesses in retail, mortgage, commercial, and wealth and asset
management, which are generating strong results and helping to cushion the impact of lower short-term rates.
We have maintained our disciplined client selection and conservative underwriting, which are evident in our credit
metrics. Over the quarter, we recorded a benefit in our provision for credit losses, reflecting a stronger economic
outlook, as well as historically low net charge-offs, which included improvements in both our commercial and
consumer loan portfolios.
In addition to muted credit losses, our criticized assets and NPLs also improved sequentially. Non-performing
loans decreased 11% from the prior quarter, with NPL inflows at the lowest level since the third quarter of 2019.
Our balance sheet and earnings power remain very strong. As a result, our robust CET1 ratio further improved to
10.5% this quarter. Our CET1 target remains at 9.5%.
As we have stated many times before, we are focused on deploying capital for organic growth opportunities,
evaluating non-bank opportunities where it fits our strategy, and share repurchases. Based on our current
dividend and trailing four quarters of net income, we have the capacity to repurchase shares up to $347 million in
the second quarter. After that, we have more flexibility in terms of how and when return capital to shareholders
under the SCB [Stress Capital Buffer] framework. Jamie will provide more details on our capital plan.
The improved macroeconomic data and outlook are aligned with our strongest overall commercial loan production
since before the pandemic. Furthermore, we have seen our pipeline strengthen considerably over the past 90
days with significant strength in manufacturing, renewables, healthcare, and technology, partially offset by muted
demand in leisure and hospitality and CRE.
Production was offset by elevated payoffs and paydowns, combined with another 1% decline in line utilization. We
are retaining the customer and their core banking relationship as virtually none of our commercial payoffs during
the quarter were the result of client attrition. Additionally, paydowns in our corporate bank largely reflected clients
tapping the capital markets, where we benefited significantly from additional capital market fees.
Given the strong production trends, firming pipeline, and retention of the client relationship, we remain well-
positioned to take advantage of a more favorable economic backdrop should clients execute their growth plans in
the second half of 2021. We will continue to assess the implications of client supply chain constraints as we
progress through the year.
Consumer employment, savings, and spending trends also remained favorable given the fiscal stimulus, pent-up
demand, and a gradual reopening of the economy throughout our footprint.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Despite the overall economic recovery over the past several quarters, I recognize that not everyone in our society
has benefited equally. This is why I'm very proud that, in addition to producing strong financial results, we have
also continued to take deliberate actions to improve the lives of our customers and the well-being of our
communities.
I am particularly pleased that we exceeded our five-year $32 billion commitment to invest in low- and moderate-
income communities by more than $9 billion. We also recently announced a $2.8 billion commitment in support of
racial equality, focused on lending, investing, and financial accessibility.
We also announced a new banking product this quarter called Momentum Banking, which competes with the
fintechs and is now our flagship mass-market banking offering. Momentum Banking provides customers with
liquidity solutions in our newly enhanced mobile app to help them avoid unnecessary fees, including immediate
access to funds from digital deposits; short-term, on-demand, borrowing options; simple goal-based savings
targets; free customer access to their paycheck to two days earlier with a qualifying direct deposit starting in June;
and no monthly service fees.
In addition, we were honored to, once again, be named one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by
Ethisphere, also reflecting our strong corporate culture, compliance program, and ESG actions. We were one of
just five banks globally to receive this accolade this year.
We believe our balance sheet strength, diversified revenues and continued focus on disciplined expense
management will serve us well in 2021 and beyond. We remain committed to generating sustainable long-term
value for shareholders, and anticipate that we will continue improving our relative performance as a top regional
bank.
I would like to, once again, thank all our employees. I am very proud of the way you have continually risen to the
occasion to support our customers and each other over the past year. You have enabled Fifth Third to continue to
be a source of strength for our customers and our communities.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jamie to discuss our first quarter results and our current outlook.

James C. Leonard
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Thank you, Greg, and thank all of you for joining us today.
We generated strong returns this quarter, reflecting our solid operating performance and continued improvement
in credit quality. We produced an adjusted ROA of 1.4% and an ROTCE, excluding AOCI, of 19.8%. PPNR
results were also strong, driven by strength in both NII and fees. Consequently, expenses were elevated relative
to our previous guidance due to performance and market-linked compensation expenses. We recorded a $244
million release to our credit reserves this quarter, which lowered our ACL ratio from 2.41% to 2.19%.
Our historically low charge-offs, which came in better than expected, combined with an improving economic
outlook versus previous expectations, resulted in a $173 million net benefit to the provision for credit losses.
Continuing with the income statement performance, net interest income declined just 1% sequentially due to the
lower day count and a reduction in prepayment penalties received in the securities portfolio compared to the
fourth quarter. This was partially offset by the impact of $2.1 billion in government-guaranteed residential

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
mortgage forbearance loans purchased from a third-party servicer in December, and another $600 million in
March.
We have continued to take action to prudently deploy excess liquidity in order to improve our NII trajectory for
2021, and these loans provided a more attractive risk-adjusted return relative to other alternatives. Our first
quarter NII results also included approximately $12 million in incremental PPP fees, reflecting loan forgiveness,
compared to the fourth quarter. Additionally, as we discussed previously, our prior quarter NII results included
prepayment penalty income for our investment portfolio, which declined $10 million sequentially.
From a liability management perspective, we reduced our interest-bearing core deposit costs another two basis
points this quarter, resulting in a cost of only 6 basis points. Reported NIM increased 4 basis points sequentially,
reflecting a decline in excess cash, incremental PPP forgiveness fees, and day count, partially offset by the
aforementioned securities prepayment penalty income decline. Underlying NIM, excluding PPP and excess cash,
decreased just 4 basis points to 310 basis points.
With a top quartile margin relative to peers, an asset-sensitive balance sheet, and over $30 billion in excess
liquidity, we believe that we remain well-positioned for a higher rate environment while also benefiting from
structural protection against lower rates given our securities and hedge portfolios.
Additionally, we have updated our interest rate risk disclosures to reflect a 38% deposit beta to better align with
our future expectations, based on the last rate hike cycle experience. In a plus-100 basis point scenario, where
we invest about one-third of our excess liquidity over a 12-month period, we would expect annual NII to be about
15% higher compared to a static rate environment.
Total reported non-interest income decreased 5%. Adjusted non-interest income, excluding the TRA impact,
increased 3% compared to the prior quarter. Our fee performance reflected strength throughout our lines of
business, including record commercial banking fees, led by robust debt capital markets revenue, mortgage
banking revenue driven by strong production, and strong leasing business revenue.
Top line mortgage banking revenue increased $42 million sequentially, reflecting improved execution and strong
production in both retail and correspondent, which was partially offset by incremental margin pressure. Also, as
we discussed in January, our fourth quarter results included a $12 million headwind from our decision to retain a
portion of our retail production.
Mortgage servicing fees of $59 million and MSR net valuation gains of $18 million were more than offset by asset
decay of $81 million. If primary mortgage rates were to move higher, we would expect to see some servicing
revenue improvement, which would likely be more than offset by production and margin pressures in that
environment. As a result, we currently expect full-year mortgage revenue to decline low to mid-single digits given
our rate outlook.
Reported non-interest expenses decreased 2% relative to the fourth quarter. Adjusted expenses were up 3%,
driven by seasonal items in the first quarter, in addition to elevated compensation-related expenses linked to
strong fee performance, as well as the mark-to-market impact on non-qualified deferred comp plans.
Current quarter expenses included $10 million in servicing expenses from our purchased loan portfolios. For the
full year, we expect to incur $50 million to $55 million in servicing expenses for purchased loans, including the
impact of an additional $1 billion in forbearance pool purchases in April.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Moving to the balance sheet, total average loans and leases were flat sequentially. C&I results continued to
reflect stronger production levels, offset by paydowns. Additionally, revolver utilization rates decreased another
1% this quarter to a record low 31% due to the extraordinary levels of market liquidity and robust capital markets.
The sequential decline in utilization came primarily from COVID high-impact industries and our energy vertical.
Also, our leveraged loan outstandings declined more than 10% sequentially.
As Greg mentioned, we are encouraged by the fact that we are retaining customer relationships throughout this
environment and are benefiting from the fee opportunities. Average CRE loans were flat sequentially with end-of-
period balances up 2%, reflecting drawdowns on prior commitments which were paused during the pandemic.
Average total consumer loans were flat sequentially, as continued strength in the auto portfolio was offset by
declines in home equity, credit card, and residential mortgage balances. Auto production in the quarter was strong
at $2.2 billion with an average FICO score around 780, with lower advance rates, higher internal credit scores,
and better spreads compared to last year.
Our securities portfolio increased approximately 1% this quarter, as we opportunistically pre-invested expected
second quarter cash flows of approximately $1 billion during March. With respect to broader securities portfolio
positioning, we remain patient but we will continue to be opportunistic as the environment evolves.
Assuming no meaningful changes to our economic outlook, we would expect to increase our cash deployment
when investment yields move north of the 200 basis point range. We are optimistic that strong economic growth in
the second half of 2021 will present more attractive risk/return opportunities.
We continue to feel very good about our investment portfolio positioning, with 57% of the investment portfolio
invested in bullet and locked-out cash flows at quarter end. Our securities portfolio had $2 million of net discount
accretion in the first quarter, and our unrealized securities and cash flow hedge gains at the end of the quarter
remained strong at $2.4 billion pre-tax.
Average other short-term investments, which includes interest-bearing cash, decreased $2 billion sequentially and
increased $30 billion compared to the year-ago quarter. The unprecedented excess cash levels are the result of
record deposit growth over the past year.
Core deposits were flat compared to the fourth quarter, as growth in consumer transaction deposits impacted by
the fiscal stimulus was offset by seasonal declines in commercial transaction deposits and a reduction in
consumer CD balances. We are experiencing strong deposit growth so far in April and expect low single-digit
growth in the second quarter from both consumer and commercial customers.
Moving to credit, our overall credit quality continues to reflect our disciplined approach to client selection and
underwriting, prudent management of our balance sheet exposures, and the continued improvement of the
macroeconomic environment.
The first quarter net charge-off ratio of 27 basis points improved 16 basis points sequentially. Non-performing
assets declined $81 million or 9%, with the resulting NPA ratio of 72 basis points, declining 7 basis points
sequentially.
Also, our criticized assets declined 8% with considerable improvements in casinos, restaurants, and leisure travel,
as well as in our energy and leveraged loan portfolios, partially offset by continued pressure in commercial real
estate, particularly central business district hotels.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Our base case macroeconomic scenario assumes the labor market continues to improve, with unemployment
reaching 5% by the middle of next year and ending our three-year R&S period in this low 4% range. As a result,
this scenario assumes most of the labor market disruption created by the pandemic and resulting government
programs is resolved by 2024 but still leaves a persistent employment gap of a few million jobs compared to pre-
COVID expectation. Additionally, our base estimate incorporates favorable impacts from the administration's
recent fiscal stimulus and assumes an infrastructure package over $1 trillion is passed this year.
We did not change our scenario weights of 60% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios.
Applying a 100% probability weighting to the base scenario would result in a $169 million release to our reserve.
Conversely, applying 100% to the downside scenario would result in a $788 million build. Inclusive of the impact
of approximately $109 million in remaining discount associated with the MB loan portfolio, our ACL ratio was
2.29%. Additionally, excluding the $5 billion in PPP loans with virtually no associated credit reserve, the ACL ratio
would be approximately 2.4%.
With the recent economic recovery in our base case expectations point to further improvement, there are several
key risks factored into our downside scenario, which could play out given the uncertain environment. Like all of
you, we continue to closely watch COVID case and vaccination trends, which could impact the timing of
reopening of local economies and reverse the strengthening consumer confidence trends. Our March 31
allowance incorporates our best estimate of the impact of improving economic growth, lower unemployment and
improving credit quality, including the expected benefits of government programs.
Moving to capital. Our capital remained strong during the quarter. Our CET1 ratio grew during the quarter ending
at 10.5%, above our stated target of 9.5%, which amounts to approximately $1.4 billion of excess capital. Our
tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, is up 8% since the year ago quarter. During the quarter, we
completed $180 million in buybacks, which reduced our share count by approximately 5 million shares compared
to the fourth quarter.
As Greg mentioned, we have the capacity to repurchase up to $347 million in the second quarter, based on our
current dividend and the federal reserves average trailing four quarters of net income framework. As a category
four bank, we expect to have additional flexibility with respect to capital distribution starting in the third quarter.
As prudent stewards of capital, we expect to get closer to our CET1 target by mid-2022. While we did not
participate in CCAR 2021, we are required to submit our board-approved capital plan to the Fed. Those plans
support the potential to raise our dividend in the third quarter and repurchase over $800 million in the second half
of 2021.
Moving to our current outlook, for the full year, we expect average total loan balances to be stable to up a bit
compared to last year, reflecting relative stability in commercial, combined with low-single digit growth in
consumer, which includes the additional $1 billion in Ginnie Mae forbearance loan purchases in April.
We continue to expect CRE to remain stable in this environment. Our loan outlook assumes commercial revolver
utilization rates migrate closer to 33% by year end. It also includes the impact of $2 billion in loan balances we
expect to add from the latest round of PPP, including the $1.7 billion we've generated to-date, which will continue
to be offset by forgiveness throughout the year.
We expect our underlying NIM to be in the 305 basis point area for the full year. Combined with our loan outlook,
we expect NII to decline just 1% this year assuming stable securities balances. On a sequential basis, we expect
7


Fifth Third Bancorp
(FITB) Corrected Transcript
Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
NII to be stable to up 1%. Within our NII guidance, we assume we generate approximately $150 million in PPP-
related interest income in 2021, of which $53 million was realized in the first quarter compared to $100 million in
the full year of 2020. We expect full year fees to increase 4% to 5% compared to 2020, or 5% to 6% excluding the
impact of the TRA.
Improvement from our previous guide reflects a more robust economic rebound, as well as our continued success
taking market share as a result of our investments in talent and capabilities, resulting in stronger processing
revenue, capital markets fees, and wealth and asset management revenue, which will be partially offset by
mortgage.
We expect second quarter fees to decline 3% to 5%, reflecting lower mortgage and leasing revenues, partially
offset by low-single digit growth in card and processing and treasury management revenue. We expect relatively
stable commercial banking revenues sequentially.
Given both our stronger fee and NII outlook, combined with the servicing costs from the loan portfolio purchases,
we expect full year expenses to be up 1%, driven by volume-based compensation and other expenses. On a
sequential basis, we expect expenses to decline 5% to 7%.
We expect to generate positive operating leverage in the second half of 2021, reflecting our expense actions, our
continued success growing our fee-based businesses and our proactive balance sheet management. We expect
total net charge-offs in 2021 to be in the 30-basis-point to 40-basis-point range, given the strong first quarter
performance and assuming our base case scenario continues to playout. Second quarter losses are likely to be in
the 25-basis-point to 35-basis-point range.
In summary, our first quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over
the past few years toward achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. We will continue to rely on the
same principles of disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting, and a focus on a long-term performance
horizon, which has served us very well during this environment.
With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first response is from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.
Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask about your investments, specifically in the Southeast. You're obviously
managing expenses for the revenue environment. But can you talk about the priorities with the investment dollars
that you are allocating for the Southeast, where are those investments being made and have we started to see
the returns from those investments come through already in your loan growth, NII, and fee trends that we saw this
quarter? Just a little bit more color on the return timeline would be helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Fantastic, this is Greg. First of all, thanks for the question. Listen, we continue to be bullish on our investments
and our strength in our Southeast markets. To remind you, these are markets we're already in, that we have a
presence and it's really about being a better provider of products and services in those markets, and really taking
advantage of the opportunity those markets create for us.
We couldn't be more pleased to-date with the progress we've seen in that market, especially if you look at
household growth, new customer acquisition, strength of our commercial businesses in those – in the Southeast
markets. So, the progress we've made to-date, we're going to continue to invest in those markets as it makes
sense.
From an other investments perspective, obviously, we balance our investments for the greatest return for our
shareholders. But right now, we think the Southeast is still a good place for us to continue to invest until we get to
the scale and take advantage of the opportunities that are out there.
And I'll – Tim, you may want to add a few things on progress.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Bill, so good question. Just to add to what Greg said. When we announced the build-out of the de novo
strategy in the markets in the Southeast, we announced that we were going to build about 120 branches. Only
about 30 of those have come on-line but those 30 branches, collectively, are contributing almost 10% of our new
household production this year. So, we are seeing some benefit there but a lot still to come as we add another 30-
plus branches in the Southeast this year and another 35 next year.
On the commercial banking and wealth management side of the equation, I think we've talked in the past about
the additions we have made in the Southeast on the fee income side of the business, both Coker Capital and H2C
are headquartered down there and have strong Southeast presences. But we also talked about adding 30
additional middle market bankers to the Southeast, and only about 7 of those positions were filled in the first
quarter, with another 10 offers outstanding. So, very clearly, those benefits are not yet in the run rate, but we've
9

been very pleased with the quality of talent that we are able to attract and we expect that to continue to further
accelerate the shift in the business mix between the Midwest and the Southeast markets.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
That's very helpful. Thank you. As a follow-up, can you speak to your asset sensitivity and any plans to alter it
from here? And then, maybe just discuss how you're thinking about the potential for layering in any swaps from
where we are currently?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah, it's Jamie. Thanks for the question. We did, as I said in our prepared remarks, update our asset sensitivity
disclosures to, I think, be a little more transparent and give you our views of how we see the next rate hike cycle
playing out. So, we did change our deposit betas from 70% down to 38%. So, with that in mind, obviously that
reflects a very asset-sensitive balance sheet, as you can see in the disclosures.
How we look at it right now is that, given our view on the economy, we believe there's still momentum and a bias
for higher rates as 2021 plays out and even 2022. So for us, we can afford to be patient, and fortunately, our
investment portfolio is running off at a pretty slow pace and the hedges aren't running off at all. We still have 2.5
more years before we have that headwind.
So we're really not forced into trades today that would sacrifice future NII levels just to make income now. So I
think we'll continue to be patient. We'll be opportunistic, but we would certainly like to see entry points a little bit
better. And our focus would be more on just extension of protection as opposed to laying on net new notional
amounts to where we are today.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Jamie, can you share with us, and maybe Greg too – we all have seen in the banking industry, and you guys
certainly are showing it as well, this incredible deposit growth year over-year. And clearly the quantitative easing
from the Fed is a major contributor to the industry's deposit growth, as well as the deficit spending by the US
government. Obviously, you're not a wholesale bank like some of our money center banks that might be gathering
some of these deposits from this quantitative easing.
Can you share with us? Where is the – or kind of give us a timeline or a trail of where is this deposit growth
coming from in terms of your customer base? And what's going to eventually bring it down so that your short-term
investments will eventually be utilized by your customers, basically drawing down those deposits?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Thanks, Gerard. Great question and a difficult answer, but I'll start with the easy parts. In terms of where our
deposit growth has come from, we're up 27% year over year, 30-plus billion dollars. Seventy percent of that has
come from our commercial customer base and 30% has come out of the consumer book.
In terms of the consumer book, the growth was really driven, as we've talked about, the 3% household growth, but
also just the consumers deleveraging. And when you slice the consumer deposit book, just March over March,
average DDA and IBTs per account are up about 30%. Savings are up 15%.
So we're seeing that consumer behavior being a little more conservative, plus the additional stimulus and all the
other liquidity programs available are just adding significant balances to these consumer accounts. I think that will
come down as consumer spending picks up, and we should expect that excess liquidity of about $2,000 per
account start to wane in the back half of this year.
But for the second quarter, we do expect consumer deposit growth to continue. We've seen that with the stimulus
payments, with tax refunds. And so we see a portion of that excess liquidity being applied to paying down
unsecured loans, but for the most part sticking.
From a commercial perspective, I think clients are just being more conservative. And I expect the commercial
deposit balances perhaps tick down a little bit slower in over a period of years as folks – while we see strong
pipelines and encouragement for loan growth, I think corporations will hold a little bit extra liquidity given what
we've just been through. And so I think you might see the ability to grow loans without really seeing a lot of run-off
in the commercial deposits, but I think consumer spending will drive a decline in the consumer book perhaps
sooner than commercial.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. I know you gave us some good color, Jamie, on the loan loss reserves relative to loans. And credit
quality for you and your peers has been extraordinarily good through a cycle that was pretty dramatic, as we all
know. What do you think – and I know it's a moving target with CECL. But what do you think about getting the
reserves down to that day-one CECL level in January of 2020. What would it take and how long will it take do you
think for you guys to bring it down to that level?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

So when you look at our process at the end of each quarter, we have a robust process that estimates the
allowance based on the credit risk in the portfolio, and that's driven by the economic forecast over the three-year
reasonable and supportable horizon that we use.
So while we feel very positive about our credit performance to date through the pandemic, there are still segments
of the economy and our loan book that have not returned to those pre-pandemic levels of health. So we do think
full normalization will take time and will not occur over a period of just a few quarters.
And I guess to answer the heart of your question, to get back to those adoption level reserve rates, we would
need to see a sustained strengthening in the credit characteristics of those borrowers that are most at risk for the
longer-term negative impacts from the pandemic in concert with improving economic forecast. And most
importantly, those forecasts need to improve above our current expectations. So I think it will take some time.

Can you size the level of your investments? You expect positive operating leverage in the second half of the year.
This must be taking some sort of a toll. And, I guess, we've heard a lot of investments you have. The Southeast

expansion, where you're opening 70 branches, that's one category. Second category would be other expansion
markets like Texas and California. And the third category would be the loan process automation.
So when you add it all up, what sort of impact does this have? When do these investments peak? If you think of a
J curve as investing and hurting your profits then improving later, when do you get to that inflection point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. Mike, it's Jamie. Thanks for the question. Really, when you look at our expense outlook for the year, yes,
we do – as you mentioned, we do expect the positive operating leverage second half of the year.
The second quarter of 2021 is probably going to be the highest year-over-year growth rate on expenses. And the
IT investments will be, year-over-year, up double-digits. We expect marketing to accelerate in the second quarter.
And then, we have the investments from the loan servicing costs for some of the loan pool purchases.
So really, when we look out at the expense guide, each quarter should be better and better in terms of expenses.
Whereas, NII grows – we're at the trough now, NII should grow every quarter. And then, as we talked about
before, fees from the second quarter trough should then build throughout the rest of the year.
So that's how we see the year playing out. Obviously, we've got some flexibility to change that expense
progression, should it not play out and deliver that extra revenue, but that's really how we see the year playing
out.

And just a separate question. For the Southeast expansion strategy, what is the end game in terms of, where do
you want to be in terms of market share, where you are today, or other metrics that you're monitoring?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Mike, this is Greg. I mean, listen, so we've said many times before, we like the Southeast markets for all the
reasons you would expect. It's also one of our strongest performing – the strongest performing sector of our
business, both on the retail side and on the commercial side and on the wealth side.
So it's really been a strong performance for us. So the end game, we want to be, just call it, top five bank in the
market from a deposit perspective will be an objective of ours. That's pretty much what we search for. We think
that makes us relevant, allows us to serve the community the best. So top five retail deposits is how we're thinking
about it.
And then, from a banker perspective, on the commercial side, just making sure we have the talent in the market to
take advantage of the opportunities down there that are presented to us. So that's kind of what we're focused on.
Tim, anything you want to add to that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Fifth Third Bancorp
No, I think that that's right. We're a little bit unique if you look at the Southeast footprint, and most of the growth in
the Southeast is happening on the Atlantic Coast side and the Mid-Atlantic, and then on both sides in Florida; and
13

we really have a metro market strategy down there. So – and the focus is on places like Charlotte, Raleigh-
Durham, Chapel Hill, Nashville, Naples, Tampa, the high-growth mid-sized markets. And as Greg said, top five in
those markets would get you to, call it, 8% to 10% market share. In those stated metro areas, as opposed to –
including the micropolitan markets elsewhere in the state.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks, good morning. Just a follow-up on the Ginnie Mae and the mortgage banking businesses. Do you still
see room to find and repurchase more of those Ginnie Mae buyouts? And you mentioned on the mortgage side
that you're retaining a little bit more of your production. Can you give us an understanding of how much of that
production you're now planning to retain and how much that's changed over time? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Thanks, Ken. In terms of the Ginnie Mae pools, they're becoming more and more difficult to locate. I think as
everybody's been executing on that play for their own portfolio. And as we talked about, we bought back our $750
million in the third quarter of 2020. So that, combined with the fact that we're over $3 billion of product now, I think
that's a healthy and appropriate allocation for our balance sheet. So I'm not looking to add more there.
In terms of the mortgage retention, we did retain in the fourth quarter $0.25 billion or so of our retail production.
This quarter, we did not elect to retain anything that was salable. So we're currently selling everything that is
salable and then retaining jumbo, non-conforming, and other items. So I think that's – and that, for now, would be
our intention for the rest of this year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And Jamie, one follow-up on mortgage. You guys have been taking a long – a little bit longer to get kind of
the pipeline through, and we saw the originations up. Can you just give us an update there on just your outlook for
origination volumes? And have you kind of gotten that – to the right spot in terms of being able to get the
production through in terms of that opportunity set? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yes. For as disappointing as the fourth quarter was in mortgage, the first quarter was just as exciting. So we feel
very good about how the team performed. The first quarter was very strong and we've got the trains running on
time and everything is in a good spot, as you can tell from the first quarter results.
So in terms of the outlook for the year, we expect the mortgage originations to be up a bit, call it, mid-single digits
– second quarter volumes, mid-single digits. But the headwind is going to be margin compression. So while we
14

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
transition to more of a purchase environment here over the summer months, volumes should be strong, margins
will compress.
And then, as those prepayments, refis slow down, we expect to see a little bit of a lift in the servicing portfolio. So
it's less of a headwind and perhaps even a positive in the back half of the year. But net-net, I think, on a year-
over-year basis, we're looking at a slight decline in both top line and bottom line mortgage fees.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Oh, I apologize. I was on mute. In terms of getting to the 9.5% CE Tier 1 target, how much of that comes from
being at the very high end of your allowable stock buybacks, like the $800 million in the back half of the year,
versus balance sheet growth later in the year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
The balance sheet growth is fairly stable in terms, I guess, of the year-over-year. We do have, I guess, the
dynamic of C&I growth, but PPP paydowns. But I don't see the balance sheet, at least in 2021, being that big of a
driver. I guess, there's a 9 basis points of erosion with the CECL transition that kicks in, in the first quarter of
2022.
But overall, our income levels are more than sufficient to cover the balance sheet growth. So the real benefit for
us is just buying back the $347 million in the second quarter, and then $800 million or more in the back half of the
year to try to bring that down to 9.5% by mid-year 2022. That's our goal. And then, also have a dividend increase
here in the third quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. Perfect. And then, just as a follow-up, in terms of your net charge off guidance, think you're at 27
basis points this quarter. Your guidance for next quarter is sort of, call it, maybe 30 basis points at the midpoint.
But your full year guidance is the 30 basis points to 40 basis points. Are you implying that second half should see
noticeably higher charge-offs? Or is that just being more conservative?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yeah. I think it's an element of conservativism given the uncertainty in the environment. We certainly could
experience charge-offs at the very low end of that range but, at this point in time, feel like it's prudent to guide to a
30-basis-point to 40-basis-point range.

Operator: Your next response is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Hi, Matt.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
So just to ask a liquidity question a little bit different. You actually had a more modest increase in both deposits
and the cash this quarter than what we're seeing for the overall industry. And I'm just wondering, how you'd
reconcile that difference?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
It's really driven by our commercial clients. And in particular, our focus on retailers where you typically have
seasonal run-off in the first quarter of every year from elevated fourth quarter balances.
I think, on a year-over-year basis, our growth is certainly at the high-end. And I think we've done a very nice job of
capturing more than our fair share of the excess liquidity in the commercial book. And then, obviously, the
household growth on the consumer side has contributed. So I feel good about how we're positioned from a
deposit gathering perspective, it is just more about when is the right time to start putting the money to work.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then, just separately, the incremental costs related to the mortgage servicing for the loans that you've
purchased, there's obviously a lot more revenue that you're getting than the $50 million of additional cost. But I
guess I was a little surprised that there's that much incremental costs, that it's just not more scalable or is it a bit
of a kind of more intensive product to service, given the nature of the Ginnie Maes?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
No, a very good question. The answer is actually far simpler, which is, we don't service the loans and, therefore,
we pay a servicing fee; and that servicing fee is certainly on the high side, given the yield on the securities. And
so it ends-up being almost a 2% servicing fee paid to the servicer. But the flip side is, you get more than that
benefit, but it does show up in NII.
So when you look at our expense guide, as diligent as we are and as focused as we are on expenses, at the end
of the day, we did raise the expense guide 2 points. Half of that is from the volume-related compensation expense
and fee growth. And then, half is from these additional loan servicing costs that are more than offset by the
improvement in NII.

Matthew O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And what's the related pickup in revenue that you get for those loans or the yield if you want to put it in percent?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Yes, high 3% yield.

Matthew O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
And then there's additional fee income that comes as the loans are resold. So all in, it's an ROA of roughly 2%,
which is very attractive in this environment and certainly better than just buying MBS in the portfolio.

Matthew O'Connor Q

Yes, agreed. Thank you.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just I guess when we talk about the line utilization improving
potentially from 31% up to 33% by the end of the year, maybe just a reminder of what you would consider sort of
a typical number for you guys?
And then, just as the follow-up, I'm not sure anyone has a great answer for it, but maybe just best guesses or
thoughts on why utilization isn't already improving kind of broadly for the industry, given that we all have what
seems like pretty good visibility into the likely trajectory of the economy, vaccination rates, et cetera. I just would
be curious to hear your thoughts there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gregory D. Carmichael A
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer & President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Scott, good question. This is Greg. I'll start it and maybe throw it back over to Tim for some more color. First off,
normalized line utilization for us going into the pandemic would have been 36% – 37% on average. So obviously,
with the pandemic, you saw a spike up to 40-plus percent. But think about a normalized range, 36% – 37%. We're
running about 31% right now. So hopefully, the second half of the year is a little stronger than we anticipate. As
we look at our bottoms-up forecast, we can pick up another 2% lift. That's a stretch out there, but we think that's
doable, given what we're seeing in our pipelines, just back up to 33%, which is still not the normalized level.
If you think about it, each 1% is about $750 million of outstandings for us. So the impact of a 2% uplift by year end
is less than 1% on total loan growth for 2021, given the ramp-up throughout the year. So it's possible. But once
17

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
again, I think there's a lot of variables out there that we're watching, but we are encouraged by the pipeline
strength that we're seeing right now.
Our production levels in commercial in the first quarter were at pre-pandemic level, so we're encouraged by that.
If you look at the pipelines going forward, the forecast right now will be about 30% up in production over 2020, but
slightly below pre-pandemic levels. And we're seeing good strength in manufacturing, healthcare, TMT, and
renewables right now.
And if you look at our markets where we're seeing some good progress, Indiana, Michigan, California, and the
Carolinas would jump out as a source of strength from an asset perspective. So production is strong. The
pipelines look good. We're hopeful we'll see in the back half of this year an improvement in line utilization. And
once again, there's a lot of liquidity out there. So it's something we're watching.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Fifth Third Bancorp
I think just to add to what Greg said, Scott, we're asking the same question to ourselves in terms of what's the
visibility we have into the economy. And some of the signals we're seeing about a pickup on inflation and input
costs, I had the chance since the beginning of the year to be out in 12 of our 15 different regions and to spend
time with clients there. So we've been asking that question. And what we are hearing from them primarily are
either supply chain disruptions, some of that obviously is some of the global dynamics that we have talked about,
whether it was stuff stuck in the canal or shortages in semiconductors, but it also is just access to materials.
And then on the other side of the equation, labor shortages, in particular as it relates to the skilled trades. And the
byproduct of that is, we're not seeing the inventory building that you might otherwise expect to see yet. So we're
watching inventory levels closely. We're watching the IFM index closely as leading indicators to when we may see
a pickup in utilization. I think one positive note, which is reflected in the results in the first quarter, is we are seeing
increased demand on the equipment side of the business. And that is encouraging because that obviously would
be the other precondition to an expansion.

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Hey, Erika.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
First question is for Jamie. Jamie, thank you so much for slide 5. I love it. Most investors have started to talk
about normalized ROTCEs as they think about valuing banks with a two to three-year forward look. And even
though you deployed some excess liquidity, what's stunning is how significant it still is relative to 4Q 2019. And as
investors contemplate what normalized returns are for Fifth Third, how – where do short-term investments
normalize to?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
So your question, are you – from a total return perspective ROTCE, or are you just asking on what are we – how
much excess cash do we end up holding?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Yes, so do you ever go back to $3 billion, or are we redefining...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Okay, got it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
...what excess liquid is for your guys?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Leonard A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Fifth Third Bancorp
Sure. Because obviously we debate daily when is the right time to put the money to work and how do we see the
environment playing out. Right now, I think the easiest way to consider the excess liquidity would be a third of it
runs off, a third of it we'd love to invest in organic loan growth, and a third of it ultimately gets invested in the
investment portfolio.
And so in terms of what that return profile looks like with regard to the investment portfolio, we want to wait for the
right time to put the money to work. But when we do put it to work, we're at 18% right now, securities as a percent
of total assets, we're comfortable running that number at 23% or so. So that means about $10 billion or so of that
additional liquidity we would deploy into the investment portfolio over a period of time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just one last question on Momentum Banking. How should we think about how Momentum Banking
can potentially impact long-term consumer deposit growth versus whether or not that renormalizes service
charges on deposits lower?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 20-Apr-2021
Timothy N. Spence A
President, Fifth Third Bancorp
Sure, Erika, it's Tim. A good question. So I think we are very focused. Our strategy, as I think we've discussed
quite frequently, is a primary relationship strategy. It's a focus on primary banking. It's a focus on being the place
where you get paid on where you pay your bills and on how you build up liquidity.
And the byproduct of that, obviously, as Jamie mentioned earlier, is we did see really positive trends in the
consumer side of the business, because the liquidity that consumers have built up really is in the transaction
accounts, as opposed to somewhere else. So our deposit growth on the consumer side has been underpinned by,
call it, 2% to 3% household growth over a period of several years now.
We would like to continue to bump that number up. And we think that the Momentum Banking product, coupled
with the expansion in the Southeast, gives us a path to doing that, in terms of the overall household growth rates
that we experienced, which will support non-interest-bearing deposit growth.
I think on the other side of the equation, yes, when somebody elects to use a short-term liquidity product, take our
Early Access product, the deposit advance product that we've had in the market for several years now, that is a
lower cost way to cover a cash flow shortfall than an overdraft fee. But it's also a very sustainable way. And owing
to the fact that we have had those products in our product set for several years now, our overdraft charges as a
percentage of total consumer deposits are lower than all but one of the large US banks already.
So I think, from our perspective, we're giving the consumer the widest possible range of options to avoid fees.
We're getting the benefit of that in the form of household growth and of primacy, which is the entry point for us to
the broadest range of products and services that we offer. And because of our position on the overdraft side of
the equation and the low reliance on that fee line, we have less to give up there and are going to be able to
outgrow any sort of an impact on the fees per household measure.
