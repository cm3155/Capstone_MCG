Dana W. Nolan
Executive Vice President & Head of Investor Relations, Regions Financial Corp.
Thank you, Christine. Welcome to Regions' third quarter 2022 earnings call. John and David will provide high-
level commentary regarding the quarter. Earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statement
disclaimer and non-GAAP information, are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. These
disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments, and Q&A.
I will now turn the call over to John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Thank you, Dana, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. Once again, Regions
delivered another strong quarter, underscoring our commitment to generating consistent, sustainable long-term
performance. We generated earnings of $404 million, resulting in earnings per share of $0.43. Our results include
the resolution of a previously disclosed regulatory matter, the establishment of an incremental $20 million reserve
for potential losses associated with Hurricane Ian, and the strategic sale of $1.2 billion of unsecured consumer
loans.
Excluding the regulatory matter and other adjusted items, we once again generated record adjusted pre-tax pre-
provision income. This quarter's results reflect strong revenue growth, driven by higher rates, robust loan growth,
low deposit cost, and well-controlled operating expenses.
Asset quality remains broadly stable, with credit metrics in line to slightly better than pre-pandemic levels. In
general, we feel good about the health of both our corporate and consumer customers. Many of our business
customers have adopted operating models, capable of thriving in uncertain operating environments, and remain
cautiously optimistic about opportunities to grow and expand their businesses.
Consumers continue to maintain strong liquidity levels, and unemployment in our footprint remains at historical
lows. This quarter's results are further evidence the investments we have made in talent, technology, and
strategic acquisitions continue to pay off, as expanded products, capabilities, and expertise are helping us to meet
customer needs and deepen relationships.
Before wrapping up, I want to take a moment to speak about Hurricane Ian. This was an incredibly powerful
storm, and communities in Florida and South Carolina all face difficult challenges as they begin the recovery
process. I'm extremely proud of the way our teams are responding to meet the needs of our customers, fellow

associates, and communities affected. Regions has a long history of helping communities through difficult times,
and we will continue to support the recovery efforts.
In closing, we have a strong balance sheet that is well-positioned to perform in any economic environment. We
have a solid strategic plan, an outstanding team, and a proven track record of successful execution. While
sentiment across both business and consumers remains generally positive, we will continue to monitor our
portfolios for indicators of stress. We have robust credit and interest rate risk management frameworks, and a
disciplined and dynamic approach to managing concentration risk, which has positioned us well to continue to
deliver consistent, sustainable long-term performance.
Now, David will provide some highlights regarding the quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Thank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Average loans grew 4% while ending loans grew 1% during
the quarter. Ending loans reflect the impact of the strategic sale of $1.2 billion of consumer loans on the last day
of the quarter. It represents another example of our disciplined approach to capital allocation.
Average business loans increased 5%, reflecting high-quality, broad-based growth across all businesses and
industries, specifically financial services, wholesale durables, transportation, information services, and multifamily.
Approximately 70% of the growth again this quarter was driven by existing clients accessing and expanding their
credit lines to rebuild inventories and expand their businesses.
Commercial line utilization levels ended the quarter at approximately 43.1%, modestly lower versus the prior
quarter; however, loan production remained strong, with linked-quarter commitments of $4.4 billion. Unfavorable
capital market pricing continues to augment loan growth; however, we believe improved market conditions will
eventually lead to clients refinancing off our balance sheet through the debt markets. Average consumer loans
grew 3%, while ending loans declined 1%, driven primarily by the previously mentioned loan sale.
Growth in average mortgage, credit card, and other consumer was offset by declines in other categories. Within
other consumer, interbank loans, which are primarily prime and super prime, grew 14% compared to the prior
quarter. We expect full year 2022 average loan growth of approximately 9%. This assumes a slowing rate of
growth compared to the third quarter.
Let's turn to deposits; as expected, deposits continued to normalize in the quarter. Average total consumer
balances were modestly lower quarter-over-quarter, largely consistent with typical pre-pandemic seasonal effects.
Despite inflationary pressures, consumer balances have remained relatively stable, supported by wage increases
and prudent spending. Additionally, new customers and additional account acquisition remains healthy.
Normalization has been more evident in average corporate and commercial deposits, which are down $2.9 billion
quarter-over-quarter. However, overall liquidity, managed by the Corporate Bank, on- and off-balance-sheet, is
relatively stable compared to year-end levels, reflecting the movement of some customer funds to off-balance-
sheet treasury management options. The movement to these products and the re-mixing out of noninterest-
bearing checking accounts into higher-yielding money market and savings accounts is as expected, and is
reflected in our overall deposit beta assumptions for this cycle.
Ending balances have declined approximately $3.7 billion year-to-date, in line with our full year expectation for
overall deposit reduction of between $5 billion and $10 billion. A rapidly rising rate environment is a significant
4

competitive advantage for Regions, based on the combination of our legacy deposit base and the more resilient
components of surge deposits.
Let's shift to net interest income and margin. Reflecting our asset-sensitive profile, net interest income grew $154
million, or 14%, quarter-over-quarter while reported net interest margin increased 47 basis points to 3.53%. Our
adjusted margin was 3.68%, reflecting the combined effects of average cash balances of $14 billion and PPP.
The cycle to-date deposit beta remains low at 9%, contributing to higher-than-anticipated net interest income
growth. We expect full year deposit betas in the high-teens.
In addition to higher rates, growth in average loan balances provided further support for net interest income.
Looking forward, while we do expect cash balances to continue to normalize, we do not anticipate accessing
more expensive wholesale borrowing markets for multiple quarters. This, coupled with additional hedge maturities
in the fourth quarter, provides further runway for margin expansion.
Total net interest income is projected to increase 7% to 9% in the fourth quarter, and is now expected to be
approximately 33% to 35% higher than the first quarter of 2022. Reported net interest margin is projected to
surpass 3.80% in the fourth quarter.
While we have purposely retained leverage to higher interest rates during a period of low rates, our attention has
shifted to normalizing our interest rate risk profile in today's uncertain environment. Through the first half of 2022,
we added $15 billion of swaps and securities. The swaps became effective in the latter half of 2023 and 2024,
and generally have a term of three years. This represents approximately 75% of the total hedging amount
expected this cycle. As previously disclosed, hedging already completed will support a 3.60% margin floor even if
rates move back to below 1%.
We made some modest tactical changes to our profile in the third quarter, primarily extending some of our current
protection. We still expect to execute an additional $5 billion of hedges, and we'll balance market rate levels and
risk to growth as we decide the appropriate time to finish the program.
Now, let's take a look fee revenue and expense. Adjusted noninterest income declined 5% from the prior quarter,
as a modest increase in Wealth Management was offset by declines in other categories. Service charges declined
as the impact of policy enhancements implemented in mid-June offset increases and other service charges,
including treasury management. We expect to implement a grace period feature sometime in 2023.
Overdraft policy changes made to-date are expected to result in full year service charges of approximately $630
million in 2022. In 2023, after including the impact of a grace period feature, full year service charges are
expected to be approximately $550 million.
Within capital markets, activity was negatively impacted by the delay of M&A deals and higher rates in real estate
capital markets. Results also include a positive $21 million CVA and DVA adjustment. We expect capital markets
to generate fourth quarter revenue in the $80 million to $90 million range, excluding the impact of CVA and DVA.
Card and ATM fees declined quarter-over-quarter. Credit card income was negatively impacted by higher costs
associated with a reward liability, while checkcard and ATM fees produced lower interchange, due to a decline in
both transaction volume and discretionary spending resulting from higher inflation. Elevated interest rates and
seasonally lower production drove mortgage income lower during the quarter, but was partially offset by higher
servicing income.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2022
Wealth Management continues to perform well despite ongoing market volatility, and we expect this business to
grow incrementally year-over-year. We also expect full year 2022 adjusted total revenue to be up 11% to 12%,
driven primarily by growth in net interest income, partially offset by lower PPP-related revenue and the impact of
overdraft policy changes.
So, let's move on to non-interest expense. Reported professional and legal expenses reflect a charge related to
the resolution of a previously announced regulatory matter. We do anticipate $50 million of this charge will be
mitigated by insurance reimbursement proceeds, which we expect to receive in the fourth quarter. Excluding this
and other adjusted items, adjusted non-interest expenses increased 4% compared to the prior quarter.
Salaries and benefits increased 3%, primarily due to an increase of 277 full-time equivalent associates, as well as
one additional day in the quarter. This increase was partially offset by lower variable-based compensation and a
decrease in payroll taxes. Over 70% of the increase in associate head count are customer-facing within our three
lines of business.
We expect full year 2022 adjusted non-interest expenses to be up 4.5% to 5.5% compared to 2021. Importantly,
this includes the full year impact of the acquisitions we completed in the fourth quarter of last year, as well as
inflationary impacts. With the changes in revenue and expense guidance, we expect to generate positive adjusted
operating leverage of approximately 6% in 2022.
Although the consumer loan sale and hurricane-specific reserve create some volatility in certain credit metrics this
quarter, underlying credit performance remained broadly stable. Reported annualized net charge-offs increased
29 basis points; however, excluding the impact of the consumer loan sale, adjusted net charge-offs were in line
with our expectations at 19 basis points, a 2-basis-point increase over the prior quarter. We are seeing some
deterioration in certain commercial segments that contributed to a quarter-over-quarter increase in nonperforming
loans, but it is important to note that we remain below pre-pandemic levels.
Provision expense was $135 million this quarter. The increase relative to the second quarter was due primarily to
another quarter of strong growth in loans and commitments, normalizing credit from historically low levels, and a
$20 million reserve build for potential losses associated with Hurricane Ian. These increases were partially offset
by a net provision benefit of $31 million associated with a consumer loan sale.
Our allowance for credit loss ratio is up 1 basis point to 1.63% of total loans, while the allowance as a percentage
of nonperforming loans remain strong at 311%. Our year-to-date adjusted net charge-off ratio is 19 basis points,
and we now expect our full year 2022 adjusted net charge-off ratio to remain approximately 20 basis points.
We ended the quarter with a common equity Tier 1 ratio in an estimated 9.3%, reflecting solid capital generation
through earnings, partially offset by continued strong loan growth. Given the uncertain economic outlook, we plan
to manage capital levels to the mid- to upper-end of our 9.25% to 9.75% operating range over time.
So in closing, we've delivered strong year-to-date performance despite volatile economic conditions. We will
continue to be a source of stability to our customers, and also remain vigilant with respect to any indicators of
potential market contraction. Pre-tax pre-provision income remains strong. Expenses are well controlled. Credit
remains broadly stable, and capital and liquidity are solid.
With that, we're happy to take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank
you. Our first question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please
proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Good morning, Ebrahim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Good morning, John. I guess maybe just to start out, I mean, obviously revenue backdrop and NII
looking pretty good heading into next year. Just give us a sense of how you're thinking about using some of these
towards franchise investments; how we should think about expense growth going from here, both in terms of
investments you're making, inflationary cost that you're seeing, and just using a better revenue backdrop to
actually invest in the franchise? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, Ebrahim. This is David. So, as you saw, we made some – quite a bit of investment last year in the fourth
quarter through three non-bank acquisitions. We continue to look for opportunities in all three lines of business to
continue to grow our franchise. We have a lot of things going on. We have our new systems we're going to be
putting in over time, and we'll see cost increases related to that; but we have our continuous improvement
program that we continue to leverage to keep our total expense growth under control.
We're not going to give you guidance for next year, but we do have a page in the deck that shows you what our
compound annual growth rate has been very strong in managing keeping and our cost down, and we're going to
continue to do that while making appropriate investments. We don't have anything specific. We're going to look for
opportunities to help grow our three lines of businesses.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
And those deals are essentially tuck-in deals be it fintech or fee kind of deals that you've done recently, similar to
those?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
That's correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just one quick question, I mean, obviously, your hedging strategy is well-understood. As we think
about in a world where rates overshoot expectations relative to the forward curve, is there any risk to a potential
7

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2022
jack to the margin at least in the short-term where Fed's not cutting, but we actually see that it's going much
higher than what the forward curve's pricing in?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, I think you have a couple different things. Higher rates for our type of franchise is good for us. So, to the
extent we overshoot 4.5%, 5% on Fed funds, we'll benefit from that. Clearly, if it stays up there longer, you end up
having some incremental credit risk; because if rates are that high, that means inflation continues to be higher
than the Fed wants and they have to keep going. So there could be some incremental credit risk until you get to –
settle down from a rate increase standpoint.
The reason we haven't completed our hedging program and the reason we have $13 billion of cash is partially
wanting to – and I want to use hedge again – but part of trying to figure out where rates might go. So we have a
bit of dry powder. That's about $5 billion that we have dry, not counting the $13 million on the books to hedge, and
we're looking for a better foothold.
So, we could be patient. Our NII is growing nicely without that. And I think in our material, we show you that we
can protect a margin right now of 3.60%, if rates were to go back to 1% or below. So being patient, I think, is the
right thing for us to be.

question.

John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Good morning, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. Good morning. Just on the credit front, if you could give us a bit more detail on the unsecured
consumer loan sale in terms of the actual types of credits that were sold, and any remaining sales expected on
that front? And if so, how are you thinking about the lost content on any remaining transactions on that side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Sure, John. It's David. So we acquired EnerBank in the fourth quarter last year. It's an unsecured consumer
portfolio. We told you at that time we could grow that portfolio double digits. That industry was about $175 billion
industry. So you're talking about [ph] $72 billion (00:22:22) worth of production each year.
But we also had this other unsecured consumer portfolio that we had built up over time that those loans were not
being serviced by us or serviced by a third-party. And we thought that the right thing to do from a capital allocation
8


Regions Financial Corp.
(RF) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2022
standpoint, a risk reduction standpoint, would be to sell that portfolio as we continue to invest in growing our
EnerBank book.
As you can see in the slides, we had reserved about $94 million. We ended up taking charge-offs of $63 million.
So, we had $31 million worth of provision benefit that's flowing through the financials this quarter. But it was really
a capital allocation and a risk reduction measure. And we don't anticipate at this time having anything else. We
don't have any other unsecured portfolios like that. That's not true; we do have a small one that's in run-off.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then separately, also on credit, sorry, can you give us a little detail
around the increase in NPLs? I know you mentioned some commercial segments. So what commercial areas did
you see that increase? Anything indicative of a trend you see there? And then I know you mentioned that you're
seeing some normalization in credit that influenced your provisioning. In what areas are you seeing that
normalization, and could that interpret into higher charge-off expectations for 2023, even though I know you're at
20 bps for 2022? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. John, this is John. So we are seeing some stress in the office portfolio, particularly urban office, a reflection
of some of the back-to-work changes that we're all seeing in the economy, consumer discretionary-related kinds
of businesses where consumers are choosing not to spend as freely as they had been. Some softness in not-for-
profit healthcare related to rising labor cost and inflation. Similarly, in senior housing; again, we're seeing, I would
say, some impacts from both labor and inflationary cost. And then some disruption in technology-related
businesses.
All that, I'd characterize, as beginnings of what we would call normalization. We're at historically low levels in
terms of credit quality, the best I've seen in my almost 40-year career. And so, we do expect credit metrics to
begin to normalize in 2023 and beyond. Currently, at 52 basis points of NPLs, still much better than pre-pandemic
levels. Charge-offs, as you noted, 19 basis points for the quarter; we expect 20 basis points for the year.
We'll firm up our guidance for 2023 in late December or January. But our current projection is that charge-offs in
2023 will be somewhere between 25 and 35 basis points, as we begin to see a return to more normal levels again
of credit quality.

Morning, Ken.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey. Good morning, everyone. If I could just focus in on the fee side. I see you're continuing to – your reiterate
your 2023 service fees guidance of $550 million. [indiscernible] (00:26:13) through the recent settlement, and the
incremental changes that you're making, and the confidence you have in continuing to reiterate that level of
service fees for next year. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Ken, thank you for the question. I think what we're observing is customer patterns are very much what we
expected when we made changes. So, you might recall that we changed our posting order. We provided
customers with alerts. We reduced the cap on daily overdraft fees. We eliminated charging for NSF. We
eliminated charges for overdraft protection transfers.
Most recently, we're giving customers access to their paycheck two days in advance. We also have implemented
an overdraft protection line of credit to help customers. And in, probably, the second half of 2023, we'll also
implement a grace period. All that designed to help customers better manage their finances, and we're seeing a
positive impact.
It's not necessarily a trend, but I would say over the last quarter, we've seen about a 20% reduction in the number
of customers who are overdrawing their account, which is again I think a very positive thing. We talked about
historically how we've dealt with changes in fees, and I'd point to overdraft fees as an example. Since 2011, we've
seen almost a 40% reduction in the collection of overdraft fees, and yet, we overcame that and grew non-interest
revenue over that same period of time by almost $500 million.
So we have a history of continuing to evolve and change our business to overcome losses in fee revenues. We're
doing that through growth in capital markets, growth in treasury management, growth in Wealth Management and
other parts of our business. And so, we feel good about the impact to customers, and believe that we can manage
the impact to our business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got it. Okay. And a second follow-up, just in terms of Wealth Management really has bucked the market trend
here, continuing to increase in a really tough market. Can you just talk about, is that new customer wins and
business adds, and is that more than overcoming just the natural market challenges?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's a combination of a number of things. One, we have very strong retail investment services business,
works very closely with our branch bankers. And in this environment, see a lot of customers who are interested in
acquiring annuities. So, we've seen nice growth in that source of fee revenue.
10


Regions Financial Corp.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2022
Our institutional business is growing, and we've had some nice wins there. And then within Wealth Management,
both opportunities to move new business, new customers, and we've additionally seen about 20% of our increase
in fee revenue in the personal Wealth Management business is a result of customers moving money to us during
this period of time where they're looking for more stability.
Our approach to the business is as a fiduciary; and I think during uncertain and volatile times, customers are
choosing to increase their level of business with us. So, all those things are contributing to growth in wealth fee
income.

Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning. Good morning. My first question is for David. David, you're implying an exit rate for NII of
$1.375 billion in the midpoint of the range of your guide. And I'm wondering as we think about that as a jumping-
off point, do you think that you can continue to grow that level of NII based on the forward curve in 2023?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think we have – as I mentioned earlier, we have some dry powder left. We still have $13 billion of cash.
We don't have to access the wholesale market for several quarters based on our estimates. We have still a little
bit of hedging to do. We did some slight repositioning this past quarter to help continue to grow NII and our
resulting margin, and really taking advantage of what could be a much higher rate environment.
I would tell you our guidance is baked on a 75-basis-point increase in November, followed by 50 basis points, and
then 25 basis points. If we had to do it all over again, we probably have that a little bit higher. So, I think we have
some incremental opportunities to grow. And our loan growth has been nice. We have a very solid balance sheet.
We leverage our deposit franchise, and I think you can – I think we're hitting a pretty good tailwind here hopefully
wrapping up the year strongly and really positioning 2023 to be a pretty spectacular year as well. Again, we'll give
you a better guidance when we get to the earnings call in January.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And then as a follow-up, as we think about deposit trends, clearly, the rate curve implies a terminal rate
over 100 basis points greater than since we last spoke in this type of earnings context. I'm wondering if you could
give us a sense of how do you – you've been very active with regards to managing some of the surge deposits.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2022
How do you think about deposit growth from fourth quarter? Do you think most of the surge deposits and that
impact would have been driven out of the bank? And additionally, with a 9% cumulative beta in the third quarter,
how should we think about terminal beta within the new Fed funds rate [indiscernible] (00:32:38) the forward
curve is implying?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, we've been saying all along that we expected deposits to decline in the corporate space; in particular,
those surge deposits of $5 billion to $10 billion. We're down about $4.5 billion since last year-end. And I think that
we still expect that to happen. We're holding on to more than we thought, and so perhaps that's a positive to us. I
think as you think about betas, so our beta last cycle was about 29%, right, 30%. We've been guiding that it's
going to be higher this go around to the mid- to upper-30s. Our cumulative beta now is at 9%. I think linked-
quarter, we're at 11%.
This next quarter, you're going to see that move up a bit. We expect about a 30% beta in the fourth quarter. It will
take our cumulative to the midteens. And then in the first quarter, we're probably going to see even higher beta
than that, call it 50%, which will get our cumulative to about 25% at that time. So, I think you're going to just
continue to see this eek up a bit, but we believe our beta, as like the last time, will be lower than our peers, which
is the value of our franchise, but call it mid-30s to upper-30s.

Can we follow up on the credit side of it again. I know your levels of credit delinquencies and charge-offs are
extremely low. But, John, when you were talking about some of the commercial stuff, can you share with us just
how large the syndicated loan portfolio is today, as well as the leveraged portfolio? And are there any signs that a
syndicated portfolio is showing signs of more weakness than your just in-footprint portfolio?

John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Sure, Gerard. First of all, no, would be the answer to the last question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
And the syndicated portfolio represents about 25% of our overall portfolio. Interestingly, we've had a 27%
increase in investment-grade balances over the last 12 months. And so, the investment-grade portion of our
overall portfolio is about 40% today. Over the last three years or so, we've seen the probability of default come
down by 19 basis points. In other words, the quality of our book continues to improve, we believe. Our leverage
book, as defined by [ph] 3x4 (00:35:43) is roughly $9.5 billion dollars in total, and about 86% of that is in shared
national credit exposure. So again, pretty high quality, we think, and we're not seeing any deterioration to speak of
in that portfolio at all.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Gerard, this is David. We have [indiscernible] (00:36:04) don't get to the back of our deck, but on page 25, we
have a lot of what John was just speaking to, and it really shows the quite a bit of improvement in terms of
probability of default and the investment-grade improvement.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. Thank you. And then following up on deposits; obviously, as you pointed out, David, a few times on the
call, the strength of the franchise is the deposits, which is true for most banks prior to quantitative easing, of
course. But what's striking is your slide 19 that those median customer deposit balances just remain so healthy.
Have you guys dug into it? I think you may have referenced about maybe some higher paychecks on the
consumer side that's keeping balances up. But what are you guys sensing from why these balances just don't
seem to be really falling off just yet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So the consumer has been very resilient. In particular, this bucket that we have on that page, that group
happened to be – that cohort happened to be the recipient of a lot of stimulus. They also are a recipient of
minimum wage increases. Our unemployment rate's below 4%. So these are people working and they're being
prudent where they're spending.
And so, they just have not spent more than they make. And I think it's attributable to what John just mentioned in
terms of overdraft being down, too. I think they were being more cautious and careful in this period of time. And
with inflation, you would expect this group to be hit more adversely, but they also disproportionately benefited.

So, that's why you're seeing this. On the surface, it didn't make sense to you, but that's what the data is telling us.
And we've gotten pretty granular with this group, account by account by account, which is where we got the
information from.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And, David, this group you're referring to, is this, would you say a FICO score group of high-600s to low-700s, or
is that about right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
It's not just lower income, lower FICOs. It has to do with how people manage their money. So, it's lower balances.
So, this customer segment was under $1,000. That can be people that have fine FICOs, they just spend about
what they make so they don't have a lot in their account. So, it's not necessarily the lower FICOs band.

Bill Carcache Q

Following up on your comment on slide 19, does the data tell you that the Fed is going to have to do more, or
does your interpretation of this suggest, rather, that consumers and businesses are just in a better position to
weather the downturn? Curious to hear sort of just your interpretation of slide 19.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
The Fed doing more in terms of raising rates and slowing inflation, or stimulus, or what?

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
From what context are you talking?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Yeah. Yes. The Fed doing more in the sense that it's the high level of liquidity and capacity to spend that is in and
of itself fueling inflation, and perhaps that that could lead the Fed to do more from that perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, we certainly think the Fed is getting after inflation. And as a result, we think their move is going to be pretty
strong this next couple of moves, at least. But this customer segment is just – they're just better – so as our
business is, frankly, better prepared for whatever downturn or slowdown we might have. Our base case is not a
recession, but we do think the probability of that has increased. And if the Fed moves at the pace we think, there's
a strong likelihood that, that can happen, but we think it'll be fairly mild.
But we do think that customer spend patterns are down. We saw that in our debit card transactions this quarter.
Quarter-over-quarter they were down. And so we think people are already being prudent with that. The inflation
that we're seeing is coming from labor. In a very tight labor market, it's hard to get on top of that, unless
unemployment rate goes up some. So I think that's what will happen over time. And then other inflation is being
driven by commodities, which is really a supply imbalance right now versus demand.
But with the Fed moving at the pace that they're moving is going to slow that down, it's going to bring demand
back to supply. And I think you'll see – the expectation is you would see a slowdown from that standpoint.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
That's very helpful. And the expectation of a mild recession to the extent that we have one that is consistent
you're your reasonable and supportable outlook on slide 23. But just for sensitivity purposes, could you give a
sense of what kind of impact taking the unemployment say to 5% – the 5% level would have under reserve for
example?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. I can give you some data points, but it's important to know that when you start picking on one particular
item, there are a host of things that go into the calculation. So, what you're asking for is everything else being
stable, except for unemployment going to 5% or 6%. So if you were to do – and no other changes, no response
from the bank, no anything, you would probably have a reserve that's 20% higher, under a 6% unemployment.
But again, you start taking into account what is the 6% unemployment mean, where are interest rates. And so our
NII is likely overwhelming whatever credit issues that we might bake in. So, it's a nice thing to think through, but

there are just too many parts to kind of figure out what the net-net is. We think higher rates for Regions is still a
net positive.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
That's very helpful. Thank you. And if I can, just for clarification, ask a final question on slide 23. Sorry, I just – I
forget what slide it was, but your overall commentary about protecting NIM in that 3.6% range, I think it was slide
20...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
...in 2023 and beyond. How far beyond 2023 does the protection extend? And would that protection still hold in an
extreme where rates fall – to take into an extreme where if ZIRP were to return, is the protection still in place, or is
it only up to a certain level of Fed funds?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, generally, when we put in hedges, they're about three years in duration. So, if you were talking about middle
of 2023 and 2024 start, so you're three years out from that, so you're a 2026, 2027 protection. And so, we will
look to extend those. We still have room for more hedging, and it's dynamic. We study this every single quarter
and we've got a group that does it every day. And so, this is just a static position that we're showing you as of the
date we produced it.

David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Good morning, Stephen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I guess I wanted to ask, David, maybe to you first, what is it that makes you think these deposit betas will be
higher this time around based on what you've seen so far? Is it really just a blending in of those surge deposits? Is
it – any sort of change in customer behavior? I just would think, with all your liquidity, they would actually be a little
bit lower based on what we've seen so far.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, I think, one, we're coming from zero. And we did have a lot of surge deposits, $40 billion worth of surge
deposits. We think that, that's going to – a third of that's going to move out. We expected $5 billion to $10 billion.
Hadn't happened yet. If we've missed it, we've been probably a little bit more conservative. We'd much rather give
you a mid-30s than a 29% where we ended the last cycle.
But I think expectations would be – for everybody, it should be a bit higher. We're coming from a low and going to
higher rate environment that we saw last time as well. And so we kind of peaked last time pretty quickly and then
start to come back down in, I think, 2019 it was. So, again, if we miss it, it's probably because we're a little
conservative.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. That's helpful. And then just you referenced the level of liquidity, cash balances here a number of times that
you still have. Securities have been down the last couple of quarters. Obviously, we saw some of those surge
deposits out and you referenced no more borrowing. So, all those puts and takes there, I guess, how low could
you see cash balances go? And do you think you'll have to continue to take securities lower to offset more of
these potential outflows without borrowing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. We generally would run with $1 billion to $2 billion of cash. We got [indiscernible] (00:46:14) to really take
care of those surge deposits that we expect to run out. And we've been a little bit opportunistic with not deploying
our cash and securities because we didn't need to, because we had good loan growth and we had good hedging
and protection. And so our NII was growing nicely.
There was no reason for us to – we could have generated more NII. But at the risk of missing an opportunity to
invest that cash in a much better environment, which is what we're getting. So, I think being patient here is
important and we really want to use that cash to fund our loan growth, more importantly, that's our first order of
business; versus trying to put it in the securities book at this point.
If we see where we think rates may cap out, could we use our securities book for some incremental hedging?
Yeah. We can do that. But think about it as we still have a lot of access to borrow from FHLB. And our total
liability cost right now, 23 basis points is the lowest in the peer group. And we don't see where we need to access
wholesale any time soon.

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. Thanks. Hi. Good morning. Just two quick questions. Just as it relates to Hurricane Ian, I
think around 12% of your deposits are within some of the counties that got kind of hit. Historically, you've seen
some deposit inflows from aid and things like that. Is there any sort of expectation that you have for potential
deposit inflows and is it material?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Michael, at this point, we don't. There's still a lot of uncertainty. Ian hit right here at the quarter-end. We did our
best estimate trying to figure out what the damage was going to be. But you're rightly to point out that, oftentimes,
in these storms, there's a lot of money that comes into federal dollars, state dollars, and insurance money. But we
haven't really contemplated any of that, and our deposit guidance does not reflect any additional deposits coming
from those sources.

Okay. Helpful. And then maybe – sorry if I missed this, but so the range for capital markets was moved a little bit
down. As we think about going into next year where, obviously, the backdrop is softening to some degree, is that
kind of the new range that we should kind of expect in the kind of a near- to intermediate-term for that business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
I wouldn't sign off on that just yet for next year. We'll give you better range when we get to the January earnings.
That was really just more for this next quarter because of what we are seeing right now, in particular with M&A
and real estate capital markets. So, don't lock that in for 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. I understand you're not going to give any sort of guidance that I totally get. What would be kind of the
broader puts and takes, in your eyes, to be within the kind of the prior range or above it or below it, et cetera?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Jackson Turner A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
I think if we can get M&A back on track to where it was. If you can get real estate capital markets to open up a bit.
Just get more activity; the whole capital markets are kind of down right this minute. We're going to continue to add
some bolt-on acquisitions or at least looking for opportunities. We had a couple that we added this past year. And
so, we're going to do some things to see if we can't help augment the pressure that we're feeling from the lack of
having, again, M&A and real estate capital markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner A

Just to be clear, we're not contemplating acquisitions in the quarter...
