Q2 2023 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2023
With that, let me now turn it over to Steve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone, and welcome. Thank you for joining the call today. We're pleased to
announce our second quarter results, which Zach will detail later. Our approach to both our colleagues and
customers continues to be grounded in our purpose and served us well in the second quarter. Our colleagues
again demonstrated that we make people's lives better, help businesses thrive and strengthen the communities
we serve.
Now, on to slide 4. These are the key messages we want to highlight today. First, Huntington has a distinguished
deposit franchise, which continues to benefit from our strategy to acquire and deepen primary bank customer
relationships. This has fueled continued deposit growth over the year, including this quarter.
Second, we once again drove capital ratios higher, with Common Equity Tier 1 having increased for four quarters
in a row. We remain on track to build CET1 to the high end of our range by year-end.
Third, credit quality, which is a hallmark of the company, is performing very well and we continue to operate within
our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite.
Fourth, we are dynamically managing through the interest rate environment. We are maintaining disciplined
deposit pricing while delivering deposit growth and maintaining a robust liquidity position.
Finally, we remain intently focused on executing our strategy. We are investing in the business to drive long-term
sustainable revenue growth, and we continue to proactively manage the expense base to align with the revenue
outlook. Operation Accelerate remains on track and we will increase our use of business process outsourcing to
drive sustained efficiencies into 2024.
Moving on to slide 5, over the past decade, we've transformed Huntington. This puts us in a position of strength
today. This foundation includes our granular and high quality deposit base, which is supported by our leading
consumer, business and commercial banking franchises.
With this strong foundation in place, we can be nimble and seize on opportunities to expand our business that will
arise during times like these. The hiring of the fund finance team we announced last month is a great example.
This business was on our commercial banking growth roadmap and we're pleased to be able to add great talent
and welcome these colleagues to Huntington.
We are building capital even as we maintain loan growth. We are optimizing the level of new loan growth and
remaining judicious for the loans we carry on balance sheet in order to generate the highest return on capital. As
a result, capital ratios expanded in the second quarter, with our CET1 ratio increasing to 9.82%. Further, our
adjusted CET1 ratio is 8.12%, above the peer median. Our disciplined approach to risk management drives our
strong credit quality, with low net charge-offs and the non-performing asset ratio decreasing for the eighth
consecutive quarter.
Our management team has a long track record of being disciplined operators, with the focus on delivering value
for shareholders. This execution has been awarded and recognized across the franchise, including winning the
J.D. Power Mobile Award for the fifth year in a row and maintaining our strong number one SBA ranking.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2023
Regarding the macro outlook, it remains a dynamic environment. Interest rates are playing out in the higher for
longer scenario that we had been anticipating for some time. Economic activity in our footprint appears to be
holding up relatively well, which supports sustained loan growth and solid credit performance.
That said, we are diligent, watching the environment closely and are actively managing our loan portfolio. We are
well-prepared to operate through a range of potential scenarios. Further, we are also closely monitoring the
potential regulatory adjustments to capital and other requirements. We are evaluating the proposals, and thus far,
the potential new requirements appear broadly in line with what we had expected. We are well-positioned to
manage through these changes, address them expediently, and over time, offset a meaningful portion of the
potential impacts.
And finally, before I hand it over to Zach, we want to share that Rich Pohle, our Chief Credit Officer, has
announced his upcoming retirement effective at the end of 2023. We've greatly benefited from Rich's expertise
and leadership during his nearly 12 years with Huntington. He's been a great leader of our colleagues and a great
partner for me and the executive team.
We have a strong bench and we're pleased Brendan Lawlor, Deputy Chief Credit Officer, will succeed Rich in this
role at the end of the year. Brendan joined us in 2019 after 25-plus years as a Senior Commercial Credit
Executive at a large regional bank and is currently responsible for all commercial credit across the bank.
Zach, over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance.

Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 6 provides highlights of our second quarter results. We
reported GAAP earnings per common share of $0.35. Return on tangible common equity, or ROTCE, came in at
19.9% for the quarter. Further adjusting for AOCI, ROTCE was 15.8%.
Deposits grew during the quarter, increasing by $2.7 billion or 1.9% on an end-of-period basis. Loan balances
continued to grow, as total loans increased by $900 million or 0.8% from the prior quarter.
Credit quality remained strong, with the net charge-offs of 16 basis points and allowance for credit losses of
1.93%. As Steve mentioned, capital increased from the prior quarter. This solid capital position, coupled with our
robust credit reserves, puts our CET1 plus ACL loss absorbing capacity in the top quartile of the peer group.
Turning to slide 7. Average loan balances increased 0.8% quarter-over-quarter or 3.1% annualized, driven by
commercial loans, which increased by $772 million, or 1.1%, from the prior quarter. Primary components of this
commercial growth included Distribution Finance, which increased $464 million; Asset Finance, increased by
$234 million; Business Banking, increased by $160 million; Auto Floor Plan, increased by $175 million. Offsetting
this growth, CRE balances were lower by $340 million.
In consumer, growth continued to be led by residential mortgage, which increased by $438 million; and
RV/Marine, which increased by $112 million. Partially offsetting this growth were lower auto loan balances, which
declined by $318 million.
Turning to slide 8. As noted, we continued to deliver ending deposit growth in the second quarter. Balances were
higher by $2.7 billion, primarily driven by consumer; with commercial balances up modestly. On a year-over-year
basis, ending deposits increased by $2.6 billion or 1.8%.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2023
Turning to slide 9. We saw sustained growth in deposit balances throughout the second quarter. On a monthly
basis, total deposit average balances expanded sequentially for April, May and June, with June 30 ending
balances above the June monthly average, providing a strong start point as we enter Q3.
Within consumer deposits, we have now seen average balances increase for seven months in a row. Within
commercial, average monthly deposits were stable over the course of the second quarter.
Turning to slide 10. I want to share more details on our non-interest bearing deposits. Overall, the $33 billion of
these deposits represent 23% of total balances and are well-diversified across consumer, business and
commercial banking.
The ongoing mix shift we have seen from non-interest bearing over the past two quarters has been in line with our
expectations and consistent with what we saw in the last cycle. We expect this mix shift trend to moderate and
then stabilize in 2024. This trend is reflected in our total deposit beta guidance.
On to slide 11. For the quarter, net interest income decreased by $61 million, or 4.3%, to $1.357 billion, driven by
lower sequential net interest margin. On a year-over-year basis, NII increased $90 million, or 7.1%. We continue
to benefit significantly from our asset sensitivity and the expansion of margins that has occurred throughout the
cycle.
Reconciling the change in NIM from the prior quarter, we saw a reduction of 29 basis points on both a GAAP and
core basis, excluding accretion. During Q2, we maintained an elevated cash balance relative to Q1, which
impacted NIM, even as it had a relatively minor actual cash economic cost.
On a comparative basis, normalizing for cash levels, NIM was 3.17% for the quarter, or a 21-basis-point decline
from the prior quarter. The biggest drivers of the lower NIM quarter-over-quarter were higher funding costs,
partially offset by increased earning asset yields.
We continue to analyze multiple potential interest rate scenarios as we forecast expected trends over the
remainder of 2023 and into 2024. The two primary scenarios we incorporate include one which is represented by
the forward yield curve, and another which assumes rates stay higher for longer and end 2024, approximately 75
basis points higher than the forward. We think this is the most likely range for short-term rates over the next six
quarters.
Based on this range, we anticipate net interest margin of approximately 3% by Q4, plus or minus a few basis
points. This would equate to core net interest income on a dollar basis for the fourth quarter to be down
approximately 1% to 2% from Q2 levels.
As we look out further into 2024, clearly the trends will depend on both those interest rate scenarios and what is
happening with the broader economy and industry factors, including loan demand and deposit growth. That said,
our modeling indicates NIM outlooks are stable to rising during 2024, which, coupled with earning asset growth, is
expected to drive net interest income dollar expansion as we move through 2024.
Turning to slide 12. Cost of deposits moved higher in the quarter to 1.57%. Our cumulative beta through Q2 is
32%, up 7 percentage points from the prior quarter, in line with our expectations and prior guidance. As I
mentioned, we continue to expect cumulative deposit beta of approximately 40%.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2023
Turning to slide 13. On the securities portfolio, we saw another step up in reported yields quarter-over-quarter.
We did not reinvest cash flows from securities in the second quarter as we allowed those proceeds to remain in
cash given the attractive short-term rates.
Cash and securities balances on average increased by $5 billion from the prior quarter, as we maintained higher
cash levels in the quarter. As of June 30, on an ending basis, cash and securities totaled $52 billion, representing
a more normalized level as we go forward into Q3.
Turning to slide 14. Our contingent liquidity continues to be robust. Our two primary sources of liquidity, cash and
borrowing capacity at the FHLB and Federal Reserve represented $11 billion and $77 billion, respectively, at the
end of Q2. At quarter end, this pool of available liquidity represented 205% of total uninsured deposits, a peer
leading coverage.
Turning to slide 15. Our hedging program is dynamic, continually optimized, and well-diversified. Our objectives
are to protect capital and operate scenarios and protect NIM in down rate scenarios.
During the quarter, we further expanded our pay fixed swaptions hedge position to protect capital from tail risk in
substantive uprate scenarios. There was a modest upfront premium associated with these swaptions, and the
hedges result in a mark-to-market each quarter as they're deemed economic hedges.
On the subsequent slide, you will see that positive impact during the second quarter on our fee revenues. We also
remain focused on our objective of managing NIM to protect the downside and have maintained additional upside
NIM opportunity given our asset sensitivity. The interest rate movements in the first few weeks of Q3 have
provided opportunities for additional attractive hedging. We have incrementally added modest additional
exposures to both our capital protection and NIM protection hedge portfolios, and we'll remain dynamic as we go
throughout the quarter if further opportunities arise.
Moving on to slide 16, non-interest income was $495 million for the second quarter. Excluding notable items, fees
increased $40 million, including a $18 million benefit from the positive mark-to-market on the pay fixed swaptions.
Excluding this benefit underlying fee income would have been $477 million. We saw solid performance in our key
areas of strategic focus, including payments and wealth management. Capital markets revenues declined by $2
million from the prior quarter, however, increased by $3 million year-over-year.
Clearly, the events of March and the US debt ceiling debate caused a fairly challenging capital markets
environment in Q2. However, pipelines remain solid and there are encouraging signs pointing to opportunity in the
back half of the year.
Moving on to slide 17. GAAP non-interest expense decreased by $36 million. Adjusted for notable items in the
prior quarter, core expenses increased by $6 million, driven by a full quarter effect of annual merit increases and
higher marketing spend.
We entered the year with a posture of managing core expense growth to a very low level given the economic
backdrop. We developed and executed a series of proactive actions to reduce expense run rates, including the
Voluntary Retirement Program, organizational alignment and our continued implementation of long-term efficiency
programs, such as branch optimization and Operation Accelerate.

We continually calibrate the level of expense growth to revenues, and we're taking additional actions to further
manage the pace of expense growth, even as we remain focused on self-funding investments in our key growth
initiatives.
We're actively working on the next set of medium-term efficiency opportunities, including business process
outsourcing, which represents a promising lever for us to continue to deliver a low level expense growth into
2024.
Slide 18 recaps our capital position. Common equity Tier 1 increased to 9.82% and has increased sequentially for
four quarters. OCI impacts to Common Equity Tier 1 resulted in an adjusted CET1 ratio of 8.12%.
Our tangible common equity ratio, or TCE, increased 3 basis points to 5.80%. Q2 ending cash levels were higher
than Q1-end, which impacted the TCE ratio by 2 basis points. Adjusting for AOCI, our TCE ratio was 7.45%. Our
capital management strategy will result in expanding capital over the course of the year while maintaining our top
priority to fund high return loan growth.
We intend to grow CET1 to the very high end of our target operating range of 9% to 10%. Adjusting for AOCI, we
expect adjusted CET1 to be in the approximately mid-8s range by year-end.
On slide 19, credit quality continues to perform very well. As mentioned, net charge-offs were 16 basis points for
the quarter. This was lower than last quarter by 3 basis points. On a year-over-year basis, charge-offs were up 13
basis points from the prior year's historic low level.
Non-performing assets declined from the previous quarter and have reduced for eight consecutive quarters.
Allowance for credit losses is higher by 3 basis points to 1.93% of total loans.
On slide 20, we continue to be below our target range of net charge-offs through the cycle of 25 to 45 basis points
and our ACL coverage ratio is among the highest in our peer group.
Let's turn to our 2023 outlook on slide 21. As I noted, we analyze multiple potential scenarios to project financial
performance and develop management action plans. Our guidance is informed by the interest rate scenarios I
discussed previously and the consensus economic outlook.
On loans, our outlook is 5% to 6%, consistent with our prior expectations to be near the lower end of our prior
range. On deposits, we maintain our outlook of 1% to 3% growth for the full year. Core net interest income ex
PAA and PPP is expected to grow between 3% and 5% inclusive of our expectations for deposit beta and loan
growth.
Non-interest income on a core full year basis is expected to be down 2% to 4%. This range reflects the results
from capital markets we've already seen in Q2 and the assumption of gradual improvement in activities
throughout the balance of the year. The remainder of our fee businesses are tracking very well to our prior
expectations.
On expenses, as noted, we are proactively managing with a posture to keep underlying core expense growth at a
very low level and calibrated to revenue growth. For the full year, we expect core underlying expense growth
between 1% and 2%, plus the incremental expenses from the full year run rate of Capstone and Torana of
approximately $50 million and the 2-basis-point increase in 2023 FDIC insurance rates of approximately $30
million.

And finally, given the strong results posted during the first half of the year, we now expect full year net charge-offs
to be between 20 to 30 basis points.

I wanted to dig into your comments on NIM being stable to rising in 2024 under the two scenarios that you
outlined for rates. Can you expand on some of the moving parts in there especially in the higher for longer
scenario? I guess would that that put more pressure on NII than the forward curve scenario with higher deposit
betas or do I have that wrong?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Hey, Manan, this is Zach, I'll take that one and thanks for the question. I think the outlook that we're seeing is
really consistent with both of those scenarios. I think in the higher for longer scenario, that's sort of the top end of
that scenario range, we would benefit from our asset sensitivity, asset yields would continue to rise. Likely, there
would be a continuation of kind of an extending out of the liability pricing cycle but the net of those two things we
continue to expect actually to be higher overall NIM given the asset sensitivity and very consistent with what
we've discussed over time.

At the lower end of the scenario, you can see the kind of the faster [indiscernible] (22:46) of the deposit pricing
cycle but also some less increase in asset pricing and likewise [indiscernible] (22:58) for the NIM but albeit maybe
a few basis points lower than that. So generally higher rates for us to continue to corroborate the higher NIM.
I would note as well that during the course of 2024, we will benefit from the shifting from a negative carry on our
down rate pension program to a much more neutral position by the end of the year. So that will give us support for
NIM trajectory throughout the course of 2024.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And then separately just on regulation overall. I know you noted that the requirement seem to be broadly
coming in, in-line with expectations. But maybe if you can dig into how you're managing ahead of that. I know
you're keeping your building capital levels from here or you're holding a higher level of cash and sort of
reinvesting in securities. So maybe can you expand on where you expect regulation to go especially as it relates
to the AOCI opt out as well as LCR?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Sure. As you noted, we are trying to be planful, anticipatory of where we think things are going and manage
ahead of it. And I think at the most macro level, we do think we'll be able to relatively expediently draft these
potential new regulations and frankly over time offset a lot of those otherwise be potential impacts on NIM.
But digging in specifically it's our working assumption that the tailoring exclusion of AOCI [indiscernible] (24:30)
CET1 will likely be removed. And hence, it's our plan to continue to manage capital higher to move CET1
inclusive of AOCI higher in the guidance we indicated in the mid-8s range by the end of 2023.
And if we continue on with the same operating posture into 2024, we would expect that ratio to approach 9% so it
should get to 9% by the end of 2024. So, back to essentially the low end of our operating range on that basis.
We're also actively looking at the Basel III potential new RWA changes. As you know well, there are three big
changes in their fundamental review of the trading book [indiscernible] (25:15) material for Huntington given our
business mix. There's operational risk requirements which likely will be increasing RWA, [indiscernible] (25:25)
fee income. We see a slightly higher RWA from that.
However, offsetting that will be credit risk RWAs, which are more nuanced, more fine-tuned and on net are lower,
we believe, for Huntington. Still early days and more analysis to go, but we see offsetting factors there, unclear
whether there'll be a net impact from that but generally relatively offsetting.
As it relates to other regulatory focuses like liquidity, like potential long-term debt, likewise we're monitoring and
we think we can – those effects will be relatively small over time. Happy to double-click on that in any further
questions [indiscernible] (26:09).

Hi, Matt.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
[indiscernible] (00:26:28) from some of your peers is a pullback in lending as they look to build capital and
alleviate of the funding pressures. On the flip side, obviously, you've got very strong capital, strong liquidity as you
highlighted, high reserves. And just wondering how you're thinking about how you can play offense and maybe
take advantage of the pullback side of some of your peers.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
That's a great question, Matt and it's something that we really actively look at because we are in a position of
strength. We want to really seize the opportunities to win new clients, win great business. So, it's in times like this
that the companies, when they operate in a position of strength, really can be meaningful including market share,
and we're cognizant of that.
We're balancing that clearly with two factors. One, the desire to not only grow loans but to also drive capital higher
as I just noted in the prior question. So, we're actively modulating loan growth, bring it down to the 10% run rate
year-over-year level to 5% Q1, 3% in Q2, we think will be more like 1% probably in the back half of the year.
We're also very much looking at how we could potentially optimize the balance sheet and drive high returns out of
the assets we do have. With that being said, we are in our front foot. You saw us [indiscernible] (27:50) team,
which would be a great new business line for us, brings liquidity, great customer quality there and we are
continuing to look, finding pockets of strong growth even as we optimize for the highest returns [indiscernible]
(28:05) margin. So, very much on the front foot. And to your point, there are in fact opportunity we'll see them
through.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And then I guess just following up on the lending side, I mean, everything we can track, it seems like auto spreads
are at or near highs, mortgage spreads are highs, commercial spreads have widened. So, why isn't there a
leaning into this or is it just that the demand is not there at this point?

Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
No, look, so I think there continues to be pockets of demand and great clients and we've got a very strong set of
clients that we're supporting as well. And to your point, the yields are strong. With that being said, clearly deposit
costs are also rising and funding costs are also rising. So we're balancing those things in a way we think is
prudent driving higher yields. I would say really feel encouraged by what we're seeing on the asset yield side.
The long duration asset categories like mortgage and auto really benefiting between 10 and 20 bps on the
portfolio and I would expect that to continue for some time to come sustaining that 2024 and beyond NIM that we
were talking about in the previous question even as they're going to be optimized to also allot capital to us.

Stephen D. Steinour A

Matt, this is Steve. I think it's fair to say we're being a little cautious until we know the outcome of the regulatory
suggested reforms as well. There's more opportunity, I think that we will avail ourselves once we know what the

So, Zach, the commentary you gave about the NIM getting down to about 3% by the fourth quarter is helpful. I'd
imagine once we move beyond that, because it sounds like most of the mix shift out of non-interest bearing will be

done, it's really going to be that incremental NIM that's going to decide where we go from there. What is the spot
NIM today, right, is it incremental loans, incremental deposits, just how does that compare to that 3% level?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Still higher than that. I think I pointed you for the quarter, adjusted for cash levels that we're kind of running at now
in the third quarter, the second quarter was around 3.17%.
And so what we're seeing at the margin is continued modest decline in NIM here through the course of the
balance of this year from that 3.17% normalized Q2 run rate down to the 3% by the end of the year.
And I agree with your point, which is as you get into the early part of next year, a lot of the kind of major trends
start to stabilize and it's really about kind of incremental, fundamental what the underlying NIM is. Likely there'll be
some potential continued trend at the very early part of 2024 but I agree with your point. I would also note that

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. Right. Just some tailwinds there. Okay. And then, for Steve, so the equity market seems to be coming
around to this possibility of a soft landing. I'm curious, when you talk to your customers, what are you hearing?
Are they coming around to this soft landing and maybe a little more optimistic, what are you hearing? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Steve, I would say our customers generally are having a good year and expect to close out with a good year.
They're working their margins through expenses, but inflation seems to be abating, supply chain is in better
shape, clearer line of sight to this half. And they're optimistic about 2024 and beyond generally.
So, this would suggest at worst a soft landing and potentially the ability to avoid a recession. In the Midwest,
particularly our footprint, there's still a lot of economic activity, announcements of investments, targeted growth.
So we're in a really good position relative to some other regions and we have significant activity going on that I
think we'll see, particularly here in Ohio through the course of this year.

Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey, good morning.

Good morning, Ebrahim.

Good morning, Ebrahim.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I just wanted to go spend some time on the expense outlook. I think you've done a lot of work here today, the
Project Accelerate (sic) [Operation Accelerate] that you talked about. And, Zach, I think you said the goal is to
keep expense growth low for next year. Maybe give us a sense of the size of that BPO opportunity that you talked
about. And how do you think about positive operating leverage going into next year given NII growth will likely be
tough? Thoughts around that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Great, great question, Ebrahim. Thanks. [indiscernible] (33:50) but maybe framing the overall posture, it is
very much to keep operating expenses at a very low level, not only this year, but next year. We've been trying to
be very proactive in setting up those programs so we can implement them effectively and have them build over
time.
On the BPO opportunity, it is something that we have leveraged over time for a while and continually will be
looking at from a strategic perspective, what functions that we really believe must be owned or which critical value
for them to be owned by Huntington versus those that we can benefit from the scale and capabilities of partner
and I think that the more we lean into analyze that from, the more we're encouraged there are incremental
opportunities relatively modest in terms of size this year, but building over time; and I think really part of the
portfolio of efficiency programs that will support that low level into 2024 and, frankly, continue to build into 2025
and beyond also.
So, it's encouraging [indiscernible] (34:50-34:55) to be able to accelerate the benefits of. On positive operating
leverage, we've said a lot, it's a core tenet of our operating plan, it's one of the three major financial targets we've
set for ourselves, it's something we take very seriously. Of course, we're managing the company for the medium
term to really generate value, and want to make sure that we're not doing anything in the short term that would
damage that long-term growth trajectory.
Too early to say what 2024 will look like. I think we'll clearly have a grow over on revenue that will pressure
revenue growth. But we're also very encouraged, as I said, with the opportunity to keep expense growth low. So,
I'm not going to give guidance at this moment, still think it's within the range of [indiscernible] (35:42) for that.

Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Ebrahim, if I could add, this is Steve. The team is also working on a longer-term project called Operation
Accelerate. We shared that at the Investor Day. It's changing procedures and digitizing substantially the front to
back side of the bank. That is going very well. It's on track and it's multi-year, and that will help us with both
efficiencies and customer sat.
So, we – Zach got his focus on consolidating 31 branches. We did a voluntary retirement program. We've done
some restructuring of segments and some of the business units and support units during the course of the year.
We'll [indiscernible] (36:27) now with BPO is additive to a very healthy level of focus and activity on the expense
management side so far this year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Understood. And any updated thoughts, Steve? You talked about building capital, but at the same time you've
talked about fee revenue opportunities, doing some targeted M&A like you've done in the past. Any thoughts
there? Is the opportunity set attractive for you to do anything?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Well, our focus, as you know, is always to grow the core business. We've got a lot of opportunity to do that in front
of us. And as the regulatory expectations around capital and liquidity, et cetera, get established, I think we're
going to be in a very strong position to lean into that and in an even more robust fashion. We're trying to get
positioned for that now.
Beyond that, as you saw last year, there are key businesses that we're attracted. I suspect we'll find some
additional ones at some point in the future. But we believe we've got a lot of opportunity at hand, and there's
nothing pressing in terms of pushing or needing to push for M&A now. And so, we're very, very focused on driving
the core.

Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Hey, Scott.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Steve or Zach, just – I'm trying to conceptually – maybe when you think about that 40% cum beta, maybe
just a thought or two on the major puts and takes when you think about that being the right number for you all
year. You guys are in very competitive market. But I think it's clear within like the last month or so, especially that
the deposit flows are there. So, I guess I'm just curious what you're seeing in terms of competitive dynamic and
what sort of make that the right number to land on it, so.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. This is Zach. Scott, I'll take that one. All of the trends and forecasts that we're creating, and as I noted in
the prepared remarks, where pretty rigorous multiple scenarios underlying that, continue to corroborate that. So,
we feel like it's a good forecast. As always, I always note the best forecast we've got, we'll share and update one
if ever that comes to pass. But our forecasts have been pretty stable around that level for a while now, and those
kind of underlying monthly trends continue to corroborate it.
Just double-clicking in terms of the drivers, I would say, one, we're seeing a continued modest rise in deposit
costs, but at a decelerating rate, just like you would expect it to be besides beta trends like 8% in Q1, 7% in Q2. It
will be less than that beyond Q3 clearly, and then kind of topping out into Q4. So that's one just sort of seeing
declining trend, albeit increasing.
The other thing is the mix shift from non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing is occurring [indiscernible] (39:43)
like we would expect it to in cycle and that, likewise, is decelerating. Most of that mix shift has happened at this
point, and we're already beginning to see the signs of that, that's again built up and corroborated to that 40%.
On the competition side, it's a competitive environment, but to your point, the deposits are there. And I think
what's encouraging is it's very rational. And I think that given a decelerating loan growth throughout the industry
and for us, that's the kind of escape valve pressure, which is allowing us to manage it pretty well here according
to our plan. So, overall, just hoping that's the right forecast.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Good morning, Erika.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
My first question, Zach, is a clarification. One, your 40% cumulative beta, that's on total deposits, correct?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
That's correct.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
That's because a lot of your peers give it on interest-bearing, so I just wanted to make sure that just thought of
that when Scott was asking a question.
And my real question is, I think the market really appreciate sort of the expansion of the net interest income
outlook. Could you tell us about how you're thinking about the elasticity of deposit pricing on the way down? I
think you pointed earlier that there are a lot of investors that are thinking about rate cuts for next year, and they're
wondering how much power do banks have to price down if rates stay at a relatively high level versus what we've
seen in a while.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Terrific questions. Also it's a topic that gets lots of mind share with us, just as rigorously as we've
demonstrated on the way up [indiscernible] (41:49) just as rigorous on the way down. So, very much playing and
watching that. I think it will clearly be a function of what segments you're in, what segment you're looking at on the
commercial side where betas are generally higher [indiscernible] (42:05) priority agreements between us and our
clients around how we'll trend. That will likewise trend low, [indiscernible] (42:15) will drive that at very similar
measure to the way it went up. I think many of the other very rationally priced segments like that in the middle
market and business banking will likewise trend down pretty fast as rates decline.
In some of the categories which we'll be drawing in consumer, there are some time dimensions to them which
we'll have to manage at those times it lasts, but again, the playbook there is well-trodden, and I think we feel quite
good about the ability to bring that down.
The overall [indiscernible] (42:51) consumer side is clearly the function of what's going on in the economy at that
point and the outlook [indiscernible] (42:56) forward at that point. But again, all the playbooks in history would
corroborate [indiscernible] (43:04) to do that pretty well.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2023
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And just as a follow-up to that, if I may. You're holding a lot of cash. And obviously, you're – there's not a lot
of motivation to deploy that. Again, as we think about next year, in the same scenario, you're still going to be
earning a lot of your cash on your cash flow 0% risk weight if the Fed cuts moderately. And I guess, outside of
better loan growth, Zach, what would be the factors for you to normalize – start normalizing that cash to a level
that's more appropriate? Or do you feel like with all the liquidity goals down the pipe, you might as well just hold it
there for now since you're getting paid for it anyway?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. So, I think that the level that we're running at for cash right now is at around $8 billion to $9 billion is the
right level for the company, given liquidity requirements. So, I think we're generally at where we think is the right
level.
Always tuning at the margin for how we're incrementally funding and kind of tuning the short-term FHLB borrowing
cash level. But I think for the most part, that cash level is right-sized right now. I think within the securities portfolio
broadly, we'll continue to see the trend of moderately lower duration sequentially, as we've been doing for the last
three quarters [indiscernible] (44:38), and just continuing to preference liquidity.

Zach, just a follow-up on your NII 2024 comments and you talked about earning asset growth. I'm just wondering,
your balance sheet has been elevated this quarter, a good amount. And I guess are you expecting, as you look
out further, that deposit growth will continue to carry the overall balance sheet side forward, and kind of, I guess,
how do you think about the wholesale funding part of the equation as a balancing act in that?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2023
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Terrific question. And broadly speaking, the answer is yes. So, I believe that we will bring loan growth in
line with deposit growth for the most parts, and I think that's what we'll see here in the back half of this year.
That's my expectation for the trend into 2024 as well. I kind of see a pretty stable, if not, slightly lower loan to
deposit ratio here over the next couple quarters. And just fundamentally match funding, making sure that we can
– it's one of those fundamental underlying factors that allows us to manage the deposit beta and the marginal
margin that we're getting on the loans, as I noted earlier. So, it's an important dynamic.
The good thing, and I think we've talked about this in the past, is that we are coming to this cycle and we're
operating, say, three quarters from beginning to end with a pretty favorable position where we saw really
attractive loan opportunities. We could, in fact, fund them with non-customer source of funding and an increased
loan to deposit ratio. But that's not the default position for now, and I think for now, I think getting loans and
deposits growing at a pretty similar rate is quite healthy and a good balance for us.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And a follow-up, can you try to help us understand how the benefits from the securities swaps look this
quarter? And then as you go forward into next year, just your loan hedges, does that become a part of the benefit
next year in terms of getting that NII starting to move the right way? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah, it does. Great question, Ken. Let me elaborate on that. So up through the early part of Q3, inclusive of
activities, we've done some in the first few weeks of this quarter, we've got around $29 billion of down rate hedge
protection through received fixed swaps, and it's around $21 billion, $22 billion. We've got some floor spreads,
which pay off under the down rate scenarios, and then a portfolio of collars, which are the option to enter into
receiving fixed swaps in the future and likely will if [indiscernible] (00:47:48) try to come generally where they're
expected to. So, it's a pretty powerful portfolio. It's full of extent now and even more that it will be extent over the
coming 6 to 12 months as we enter into those collar-based receive-fixed swaps.
The impact – obviously, the challenge in down rate hedging right now is there was an inverted yield curve, and
frankly, with a fairly steep decline already forecasted. We've got to assume pretty dire down rate scenarios to
convince yourself it makes sense incrementally and you'll receive fixed right now, given the negative carry right
now.
What we're experiencing in the P&L at this moment is about 15 basis points of negative NIM drag from the
receive-fixed that were already in, and that will go to essentially zero by the end of 2024 if you follow up the
forward yield curve scenario. So that's 15 basis points of tailwind that we should see in NIM between now and the
end of 2024, fairly ratable clawback, drawback period.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
You've done a great job and I've enjoyed your perspective on these calls. Commercial real estate and consumer
question. So on commercial real estate, how far ahead can you guys look in terms of identifying future issues? I
know it's been a focus for you guys to tighten things up. But curious what you're doing now, and it obviously looks
very clean, but you have a fair amount of reserves allocated to the business, and that's kind of why I ask.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. We're looking – we're focused primarily right now on the 2023 and 2024 impacts, and it's really hard to look
much further beyond that. So, we're doing quarterly portfolio reviews in office. We're touching the real estate book
every month. I think we've probably gone through 90% of the loans, over $5 million in that book at this point. But
the focus is on 2023 and 2024 and managing what we can control, and that really relates to the maturities, and
then particularly with respect to office, the lease rollovers that might be impacting cash flow in this year and next.
So that's the primary focus. Beyond that, it's tough.
You mentioned the 9% reserve we've got against office. We've got a 3.4% reserve against the overall CRE book.
We feel, for what we know right now, both of those are adequate and we'll continue to look at those on a quarter-
by-quarter basis.

Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Jon, there's also – Jon, Rich is also – would continue getting loans rebalanced. Whenever there appear to be
issues, there are proactive efforts to try and get those addressed, pay-downs, possible [indiscernible] (00:50:59)
and the primary focus is 2023, 2024. But there's also a long view – a full view of the portfolio over the next
decade, and these roles and other related issues, all of which we're actively managing. We've been doing that for
over a year and trying to stay well ahead of where any issues may occur. And at this point, the book is in really
good shape.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. It seems that way. Okay. And then, on consumer, I look at this every quarter, just your non-accruals and
charge-offs, and it's just kind of – it's nothing really. Maybe it goes to the soft landing comments, but you look at
RV, marine, consumer categories, delinquencies really haven't budged. Are you seeing anything in consumer
health that bothers you at all because just these numbers are really, really good?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
No. The numbers are really good. And I think it goes to the client selection and just the focus that we've got on
prime, super prime. If you look across the entire consumer spectrum, there's really nothing in there that would
lead you to believe that we're going to have anything more than just a gradual return to what might be more
normalized levels of charge-offs, because right now, to your point, we're running extremely low.
The only area that I would point out that's a little bit relatively higher stressed than the rest of the book is
[indiscernible] (00:52:38), and that's because of the floating rate nature of that portfolio. So, it's going to be to a
little higher level of delinquencies than you might see across the book. But the analysis that we've done from a
vintage standpoint on that book show that we're in the 55% to 60% loan to value range. So, you might see higher
levels of delinquency. We don't think the losses will follow.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
The housing markets are generally tight where we are, Jon. So if someone has – and unemployment is very low.
So if someone has an issue, the best resolution is to sell the property, unlike what we might have seen in 2008,
2009, or prior [indiscernible] (00:53:19).
Just to give Rich a little credit here and recognition, we've been at an effort to outperform our peers for over a
decade with this aggregate moderate to low risk profile. And he's been very, very disciplined about that, and we
expect to outperform through the cycle. We've been sharing that all along. At this point, we're looking really good
in that regard and attribute to all my colleagues, especially Rich, in his leadership.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q

All right. Just to clean up for you, Zach, the – from $60 million to $50 million on the Capstone Torana, what drove
that? I know it's small, $10 million, but what happened there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. That's really – that's reflective of – the cost that we see in that previous $60 million was mainly Capstone
and has a factor of production and revenues that flow through into compensation expense. And so, when capital
markets revenues were a bit softer in the second quarter, our outlook is somewhat lower than was originally
budgeted into the back half of the year. Still proud of them, but just less flow through into [indiscernible]

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
So, let me clarify that. It's a really important one. That FDIC expense that we talked about in that guidance is the 2

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2023
Well, thank you very much for joining us today. We're very pleased with the second quarter results as we
dynamically manage through this unique environment. As you heard, we're very well-positioned for times such as
these with strong credit quality, improving capital ratios and robust liquidity. The deposit growth, in particular,
that's granular in nature, has served us very, very well, as have our efforts to provide customer service and
generate great satisfaction over the years.
Now, we have a team of disciplined operators and we are executing on our strategy that we outlined last year at
our Investor Day, which [indiscernible] (00:56:10) driving value for our shareholders. And just as a reminder, the
board, the executives, our colleagues are all top 10 shareholders collectively. So, that reflects the strong
alignment with our shareholders. And I think you're seeing the benefits of that through our results.
So, thank you for your support and interest in Huntington and have a great day.
