Q1 2020 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2020
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Regions Financial Corporation's Quarterly Earnings Call. My name
is Shelby, and I'll be your operator for today's call. I would like to remind everyone that all participant phone lines
have been placed on listen-only. At the end of the call, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator

Dana W. Nolan
Executive Vice President & Head-Investor Relations, Regions Financial Corp.
Thank you, Shelby. Welcome to Regions First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. John Turner will provide
some high level commentary, and David Turner will take you through an overview of the quarter. Earnings-related
documents, including forward-looking statements, are available under the Investor Relations section of our
website. These disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments, as well as the Q&A segment of
today's call.
With that, I will now turn it over to John.

John M. Turner, Jr.
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Thank you, Dana, and thank you all for joining our call today. I want to begin the call today by thanking our 19,000
associates who despite tremendous disruption in their personal and professional lives continue to come together
as a team to support each other, our customers and communities through the COVID-19 pandemic. The last few
weeks have certainly been challenging. However, our top priority is the health and well-being of our associates
and customers. In order to do our part to reduce the spread of COVID-19, we were one of the first banks to limit
in-person branch activity through our drive-throughs and converted our office services to appointment only.
We also reopened previously closed locations to better serve our customers. Fortunately, due to our footprint the
majority of our branches have drive-through capabilities and I'm proud that we've been able to keep 97% of our
branches open during this time. Additionally, almost half of our associates are now working remotely. Our teams
remain committed to delivering the financial advice and guidance our customers have come to expect from the
Regions bankers. These changes will help us do so in a way that minimizes the associated health risks.
We are offering special financial assistance to support our customers who are experiencing financial hardships
related to the pandemic. Through Tuesday, we have processed approximately 17,000 consumer payment deferral
request, including approximately 4,000 related to residential mortgages. In addition, we've processed requests for
approximately 12,000 mortgage loans serviced for others. From a business customer perspective, we processed
approximately 4,000 more. Also as the certified SBA lender, we've been working very hard to help customers
through the new Paycheck Protection Program and I'm proud to say that through yesterday, we have facilitated
assistance to our business customers totaling $2.8 billion. We've recognized the importance to our customers and
their employees of access to fund through this program.
In the span of eight days, we established a cross functional team to create an end-to-end digital application, built
automation around every feasible point in the process, reassigned several hundred staff from other departments

and train them to accept and process loan applications for small business owners. We're hopeful Congress will
appropriate additional funds as significant need remains.
Importantly, the bank also contained to lend the customers outside of the stimulus programs. During the quarter,
new and renewed loan originations to business customers totaled just over $10 billion. Further, through the bank
and our foundation, we've committed approximately $5 million toward consumer and small business recovery
efforts. We are also donating advertising time originally purchased for promoting bank products and services to
food banks across our footprints. These advertisements encourage viewers to finance and support food banks as
they strive to help those in need.
As we navigate through this crisis, our teams will continue to come together to identify innovative and meaningful
ways to better connect with and serve our customers. For some time now, we have communicated our goal of
generating consistent, sustainable long-term performance through every economic cycle. All of our plans are built
around this concept. Because of our focus and the deliberate steps we have taken. We entered these challenging
times from a position of strength underpinned by robust capital and liquidity. This will allow us to better support
our customers as we work together to get through this unprecedented time in our history.
We will incur some stress, that's just a result of the economy we're in as we combat this public health crisis. But
unlike the crisis the financial services industry experienced a decade ago, we are providing solutions to meet the
needs of our customers during this extraordinary time. We've spent decades strengthening our capital position
and risk management framework through an intense focus on risk adjusted returns, client selectivity and robust
concentration risk management. We have built a more balanced and diverse portfolio. Our strong capital and
liquidity positions combined with extensive de-risking efforts give us confidence that we can weather the pressure
from the abrupt economic slowdown.
In addition, two years ago we initiated a significant hedging strategy to reduce net interest income variability and
protect us from the impacts of a lower interest rate environment. The benefit from our hedging strategy provides
us with a substantial competitive advantage in the current low rate environment. All of this allows us to move
forward confidently and remain focused on the things we can control, providing support to our associates and
communities and offering first-class advice, guidance and education to our customers.
Although, we're in a time of significant economic stress, it's too soon to estimate its duration or severity. We are
encouraged by the actions taken by government and bank regulators to provide relief to individuals and small
businesses, while also supporting the smooth functioning of the financial markets. In light of this uncertainty, we
are resending our financial targets for this year along with our three year targets previously announced in 2019.
We remain committed to our strategic plan, but acknowledge the need to remain flexible during this time of
unprecedented and historic uncertainty. We will provide updates with respect to our financial targets once
conditions stabilize, and we have better visibility. We adopted the concept of shared values several years ago,
whereby what we do as a business must create long-term value for customers, communities, associates and
shareholders. Frankly, I'm convinced that it has never been more important as we work through the current health
crisis together with our customers and communities.
Thank you for your time and attention this morning. With that, I will now turn it over to David.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2020
First quarter net income totaled $139 million, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $0.14. Items impacting our
results this quarter includes a significant CECL provision in excess of net charge-offs and a large increase to our
CVA associated with customer derivatives as interest rates moved down substantially during the quarter and
credit spreads widened, partially offsetting the negative adjustments, our MSR net of hedges performed favorably
during the quarter. In total, the adjustment and additional selected items highlighted on the slide reduced our pre-
tax results by approximately $280 million.
Let's take a look at our results starting with the balance sheet. Adjusted average loans increased 1% while
adjusted ending loans increased 7%. Loan growth was driven primarily by elevated commercial draws activity late
in the quarter. Utilization rates increased from 45% at the end of the year to 54% at the end of March. As a point
of reference, our utilization rate is typically around 45% and during the global financial crisis peaked around 51%.
In the last week of the quarter, the pace of increase slowed and we expect utilization rates will remain relatively
stable for the time being. The draws we experienced have been primarily defensive or cautionary in nature and
are broad-based geographically and across all industries. Approximately 60% have come from investment grade
companies. So we anticipate a portion of these customers will eventually seek permanent financing through the
capital markets. However, it is too early to try and predict timing of any refinancing.
As a result, predicting loan growth is challenging. However, I do want to remind you that on April 1, we closed our
purchase of Ascentium Capital, which included approximately $2 billion in loans to small businesses. We look
forward to leveraging the technology, speed and convenience that Ascentium is known for in combination with our
broad spectrum of banking solutions to meet the needs of small businesses during this difficult time.
Let's turn to deposits, average deposits increased 1% while ending deposits increased 3% as many of our
corporate customers drawing on their lines are keeping that excess cash in their deposit accounts. We expect
these balances will come down over time, as customers secure financing in the capital markets or customers get
more clarity regarding the economic impact of the health crisis.
As we have experienced in previous periods of stress, consumer deposits increased as customers seek the
safety and soundness of a regulated and insured financial institution. We expect total deposits will continue to
increase both at Regions and across the industry. On an ending basis, corporate segment deposits increased 8%
while wealth and consumer segment deposits each increased 3%. These increases were partially offset by
decrease in the wholesale broker deposits within the other segment.
Shifting to net interest income and margin, which is a strong story for Regions. Net interest income increased 1%
linked quarter and net interest margin increased 5 basis points to 3.44%. As expected, net interest income and
net interest margin have been a source of stability under an extremely volatile market interest rate backdrop.
Specifically, lower loan yields were offset by lower funding cost and the benefit of forward starting hedges
becoming active in the quarter.
Now that most of our forward starting hedges have begun and given our ability to move deposit costs lower, our
balance sheet is largely insulated from movement in short-term rates. Low hedges added $10 million to net
interest income and 4 basis points to the margin in the quarter. This will increase going forward as the benefits
are realized for the entirety of future quarters. Further all of our hedges have five year tenures and a quarter end
market valuation of $1.7 billion, another relative differentiator.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2020
Of note, net interest income was supported in March as LIBOR rates remained elevated at a time when other
short-term rate indices which are a large driver of deposit cost moved close to zero. The benefit of elevated
LIBOR is projected to normalize by mid-year. Additionally, higher average loan balances increased net interest
income, but reduced net interest margin while one fewer day in the quarter reduced net interest income, but
increased net interest margin.
Total deposit cost declined 6 basis points compared to the prior quarter to 35 basis points and interest bearing
deposit cost declined 9 basis points to 55 basis points. Regions continues to deliver industry leading performance
in the space exhibiting the strength of our deposit franchise. Over the coming quarters, we expect deposit cost to
migrate back down into the 10 basis point to 14 basis point range.
Looking ahead to the second quarter, let me start by saying these expectations exclude the potential impact from
the Fed's Paycheck Protection Program, but are too uncertain to include in the forecast at this time. We expect
second quarter net interest income and net interest margin to benefit from the Ascentium Capital acquisition. Net
interest margin is anticipated at roughly 3.4%. Excluding Ascentium, a larger average balance sheet in the near-
term is anticipated given increased loan and liquidity needs from our customers. While this will benefit net interest
income, it will slightly reduce net interest margin.
Let's take a look at fee revenue and expenses. Almost all non-interest revenue categories were impacted by
market volatility and economic uncertainty, resulting in a 14% decrease compared to the prior quarter. After
experiencing a record quarter in the fourth quarter, capital markets revenue decreased to $9 million. Excluding
unfavorable CVA, capital markets income totaled $43 million. We generated record customer derivatives income
in connection with lower interest rates, but experienced decreases across all other categories.
Looking forward, M&A transactions, in particular, are likely to remain on hold until markets stabilize and the
economic outlook becomes more certain. Mortgage income increased 39% over the fourth quarter, driven
primarily by elevated sales and record application volumes associated with the favorable rate environment, as
well as positive net hedge performance on mortgage servicing rights.
Lower interest rates sparked a significant increase in year-over-year production. In fact, our first quarter total
application volume was more than double our historical first quarter average. Wealth management revenue
remained stable despite market volatility. If market conditions persist, however, we could experience a decline
next quarter in line with lower asset values.
Service charge revenue and card and ATM fees decreased 5% and 6%, respectively. During the last two weeks
of the quarter, we observed a reduction of approximately 30% in consumer spending activity. Looking forward, if
current spend levels persist, we estimate total consumer non-interest income will be negatively impacted by
approximately $20 million to $25 million per month from pre-March levels. Partially offsetting these headwinds,
however, are positive revisions to anticipated mortgage income, resulting from lower interest rates. Mortgage
production increased 60% compared to the first quarter of the prior year and pipelines are strong. Full-year 2020
production is expected to increase by approximately 40% versus the prior year.
Let's move on to non-interest expense. Adjusted non-interest expenses remained well controlled, decreasing 5%
compared to the prior quarter, driven primarily by lower salaries and benefits, professional fees and marketing
expenses. Salaries and benefits decreased 4% driven by lower production based incentives and negative market
value adjustments on employee benefit assets, which are offset by lower non-interest income.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2020
Professional fees decreased 36% driven primarily by elevated legal, consulting and professional fees in the fourth
quarter. The company's first quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was 57.9% and the effective tax rate was 20.6%. We
continue to benefit from continuous improvement processes as we have completed only 40% of our current list of
identified initiatives. For example, since the first quarter of last year, we have reduced total corporate space by
almost 900,000 square feet or 7%. While still early, the pandemic is already having an impact on how we interact
and communicate with customers and each other.
We've already initiated changes and in many instances are discovering that not all change is bad. For example,
we have wealth teams calling on and winning business using Webex and videoconferencing in effective and
dynamic ways, whether it's through new ways to interact with customers for increased use of hoteling, we believe
there are additional opportunities where corporate space is concerned. So we're going to keep our minds open as
we navigate through this disruption.
So let's shift to asset quality. We adopted the seasonal accounting standard as of January 1, 2020. As permitted
by the Federal Reserve, we will defer the impact from the seasonal accounting standard on Common Equity Tier
1 capital each quarter until the end of 2021, after which you will be phased in at 25% per year. As of March 31 this
amount is approximately $440 million and represents all of our day-one after tax adjustment recorded directly as a
reduction of shareholders equity on January the 1, as well as 25% of our first quarter provision in excess of net
charge-offs. The related impact to our first quarter Common Equity Tier 1 ratio is approximately 40 basis points.
Under CECL, credit loss provision expense for the quarter totaled $373 million. This amount includes providing for
$123 million in net charge-offs as well as $250 million of additional provision, reflecting adverse economic
conditions and significant uncertainty within the economic forecast, including uncertainty surrounding the benefits
of government stimulus already enacted and potential additional stimulus all occurring since the initial assessment
and adoption on January 1, 2020. The additional provision was further impacted by higher specific reserves
associated with downgrades, primarily in the energy and restaurant portfolios.
The resulting allowance for credit losses is 1.89% of total loans and 261% of total non-accrual loans. Charge-offs
were 59 basis points this quarter and included the impact from our most recent shared national Shared National
Credit exam. Non-performing loans increased to $131 million, primarily driven by energy credits. Total
delinquencies and troubled debt restructured loans decreased 4% and 9% respectively, while business services
criticized loans increased 12%.
Recently, regulatory agencies issued guidance stating short-term modifications to borrowers experiencing
financial distress, as a result of economic impacts created by COVID-19 will not be classified as a troubled debt
restructured loan as long as their payments were current as of December 31. We do not expect a material
increase in TDRs.
In this environment, we are monitoring all of our portfolios closely. However, I want to take a couple of minutes to
highlight a few portfolios currently experiencing stress. In most instances, these are the same portfolios we have
been discussing for some time now. Energy is a portfolio we continue to monitor. Direct energy balances totaled
$2.4 billion or 2.7% of loans outstanding at quarter end. Since 2014, we have worked diligently to remix the
portfolio and reduce our exposure to the oilfield services sector, which is where most of our losses have occurred.
During the quarter, we conducted an intensive review of all of our energy clients, including E&Ps, midstream and
oilfield services which resulted in a handful of downgrades in both the E&P and midstream space. We have been
in the energy business for over 50 years and have always maintained a heavy focus on client selectivity. Our
spring borrowing base redeterminations are in process and we are continually reassessing our price deck.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2020
At current oil price levels, we do expect additional stress, but overall believe the portfolio will perform at least as
well as it did in the 2014 crisis perhaps even better given the significant remixing in the portfolio. Within the
hospitality portfolio, which includes restaurant and hotels, we are closely monitoring casual dining and quick
serve. Total restaurant balances were $1.9 billion at quarter end, casual dining restaurants with balances of
approximately $550 million are continuing to experience stress due to higher labor costs, oversupply, digital
transformation challenges and general pressure on margins. We expect additional pressure in this space as
shelter-in-place orders continue.
In fact we're already receiving requests for mitigation and payment deferrals. Quick serve which represents 63%
of our restaurant portfolio seems to be holding up well. Our exposure to hotels is primarily limited to a handful of
large well-structured reach, which typically have lower leverage and strong cash positions. Depending on the
ultimate duration of the pandemic, we expect most will weather the downturn. However, we have already
experienced several requests for relief.
We're also closely watching the transportation, retail and agriculture portfolios as they also have the potential to
be adversely impacted by the current business environment. I previously mentioned the approximately $2 billion
of small business loans we acquired as part of the Ascentium Capital acquisition on April 1st. These balances will
be reported with our second quarter results. But let me briefly remind everyone that under CECL, you will see a
sizable adjustment currently estimated to be between $100 million and $120 million, establishing our initial
allowance for these loans, which will run through provision expense. This expense will be offset by accretion of
the credit discount through interest income over the life of the purchase loan portfolio.
Recent annual loss rates on this book of business have been approximately 2.5%, because they focus on
business essential equipment and high FICO guarantors, we believe the business will be resilient through periods
of stress. Recall, the average yield on these loans are approximately 10%, and they do include certain
prepayment protections. So while losses will increase in the near term due to the economic environment, we
continue to feel very good about the acquisition and are looking forward to working together to better support our
small business customers.
The extent to which all of our customers are ultimately impacted will be a factor of the duration and severity of the
economic impact, as well as the effectiveness of the various government programs in place to support individuals
and businesses. There is a lot that is still unknown. However, what we do know is that we enter this environment
from a position of strength and are committed to assisting our customers and communities.
As John mentioned, we know we will experience some stress; however, our strong capital and liquidity positions
accompanied by a decade long journey to enhance our credit risk management framework and our disciplined
and dynamic approach to managing concentration risk have made us better managers of risk and have positioned
us well to weather an economic downturn.
So let's take a look at capital and liquidity. During periods of stress, liquidity management is critical. Like the rest
of the industry, we experienced a spike in credit line draws late in the quarter. These were primarily from
companies being prudent and wanting to ensure they had adequate cash on hand. We did the same thing through
additional advances at the Federal Home Loan Bank, which we used to increase our cash at the Federal
Reserve.
Liquidity at Regions really starts with our granular and stable deposit base which provides superior liquidity value.
Regions has traditionally maintained one of the lowest loan-to-deposit ratios in our peer group. At the quarter end,

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2020
this ratio stood at 88% and includes the impact of increased line of credit draws observed by customers late in the
quarter. Further, our risk management and stress testing framework ensure our liquidity positions are prepared to
meet customer needs in turbulent times such as these.
Beyond deposits, Regions also has ample sources of additional liquidity, which can be readily used to meet
customer needs. Our primary liquidity sources include cash balances held at the Federal Reserve, borrowing
capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank, and unencumbered highly liquid securities. These readily available
sources totaled approximately $28 billion at quarter end and when combined with another $15 billion of availability
at the Federal Reserve's discount window, total available liquidity stands at $43 billion.
FHLB advances remain the primary tool we use to fulfill short-term funding needs. We have seen great interest in
the SBA Paycheck Protection Program loans and we are endeavoring to meet the needs of customers. While we
will use liquidity resources on hand to meet those near-term needs, we're also looking at the Federal Reserve's
new Paycheck Protection Program [ph] lending facility (00:28:10) as an alternative funding source.
With respect to parent company cash, we also maintain a conservative position. By policy, parent company cash
must always exceed 18 months' worth of debt service and dividend payments and current cash forecast remain
above our management target of 24 months.
Let's turn to capital. Regions continues to maintain strong capital levels. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio is
estimated at 9.4%. Our quantitative target for this ratio is derived mathematically and as we have previously
discussed is 9%. We believe this is the appropriate level of capital to withstand a severely adverse scenario and
still remain above post stress limits. We've also maintained approximately 50 basis points as a strategic
management buffer which could be deployed opportunistically. We used a portion of the management buffer on
the Ascentium transaction which closed April 1.
As we go forward, future economic performance and its impact on earnings will be the primary driver of near-term
capital levels. In addition to the negative implications due to COVID-19, it is also important to keep in mind that we
have never seen the volume at which fiscal stimulus and government lending programs have been implemented.
The ability of these programs to effectively work to help support the businesses and consumers within the
economy will dramatically impact credit performance for us and the industry.
During this period of uncertainty, we will continue to work with our customers to help them navigate these
uncertain times. Additionally, we will lean into our early warning and key performance indicators that we have built
over the years, which give us a granular view into the performance of our portfolios, where we see indications that
a customer will continue to face stress once the short-term relief is over, we will move those credits into more
adversely rated categories and we'll continue to review their performance.
As you know, we have a robust capital planning infrastructure and perform a range of stresses on credit
performance within our portfolio. Whereas this environment is unlike anything we have ever seen, our stress
testing gives us confidence that we have the capital to withstand the stress. During the quarter, the company
declared $149 million in common dividends. We had no share repurchases during the quarter and have
announced plans to suspend share repurchases through the second quarter, because we established our
dividend to withstand adverse conditions, we currently have no plans to reduce or eliminate our dividend.
However, we will continue to exercise prudent capital management and monitor the business environment.
So in summary, our robust capital and liquidity planning processes which are stressed internally as well as
externally by our regulators are designed to ensure resilience and sustainability. This gives us confidence that we

can continue to meet the needs of our customers and communities during this exceptional period of economic
uncertainty.
As John mentioned, considering the unprecedented environment we are facing, we are rescinding our financial
targets for this year as well as our three-year targets previously announced in 2019. We have a good strategic
plan and are committed to its continued execution. When the economic outlook becomes more certain, we will
provide you with updated targets.
In the meantime, we are focusing our attention on helping our associates, customers and communities navigate
through this difficult landscape which in turn benefits you, our shareholders. We believe strongly in the concept of
shared value in order for us to thrive the communities we serve also need to thrive. Rest assured during this
extraordinary time, Regions stands ready to help and support all of our stakeholders.
With that, we're happy to take your questions. In light of the current environment, we do ask that each of you ask
only one question to allow for more participants. We will now open the line for your questions.

Hi. Good morning. Hey, good morning. A couple – so my one question is just regarding the decision to pull the
medium-term guidance, I totally understand the 2020, but when I see that you're pulling the medium-term
guidance, I'm wondering is that because of the concern you have around the depth of how tough 2020 could end
up being, or is there some other rationale for that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, Betsy. This is David. I just think given the uncertainty that's in the environment right now, which is prudent
for us to just remove it all. There'll be an appropriate time for us to put back and give you our target, long-term
targets. I mean, you've known after a couple of [ph] Investor Days (00:33:49), where we strive to get, but it just
didn't seem appropriate for us to have those at this time.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. So I just – a question on just all the moving parts around your NII forecast. I –
understanding that there's the lower PPP, there's the Ascentium. I guess with the persistence of your hedges, do
you still believe you've got that general sustainability past 2Q in terms of the ability to support dollars of NII as you
look past these – the adds as you get in from first or second, how would you help us understand that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, going into the second quarter, we said we pick up NII resulting from our Ascentium acquisition, [ph] I
believe (00:34:51) the hedge as you could see our – we have chart in there as to when our hedges continue to
more of them kick in latter part of this quarter and into the second quarter. We only had $10 million of benefit in
the first quarter from our hedges. You can see we also have $1.7 billion of fair value which comes in over
approximately five years. So if we just did some straight lining, you would see an approximate $75 million benefit
in each of the quarters and it's not straight line, but that just gives you a ballpark.
So with that, we strongly believe in the support we're going to get from our hedges. We think that's a big
differentiator for us. Clearly, the margin will shift down a bit and then kind of stabilize there for the remainder of
the year. After the Ascentium impact and you get the hedges rolling in, the growth in NII really will be driven by
the balance sheet and what happens from that standpoint.

Analyst, Autonomous Research
Oh, hi. Maybe a follow-up on the hedges, you know it's interesting, [ph] I mean (00:36:11), all the regional banks
generally opted out including [ph] AOCI in capital as to be (00:36:16) seen as a form of regulatory release, but
now especially for a bank like you where you've got the [ph] outside team that (00:36:24) you kind of understates
your capital ratios in a way, so I wonder can you just remind us what [ph] would (00:36:31) the capital ratios look
like if the unrealized gains were included, and is there any scenario where the hedges are so valuable you would
actually monetize that – invest them some way in an acquisition or a buyback or is that just too far out there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, so we made our decision to exclude OCI. It was a choice we had. Had we not made that choice, we would
have had, just with the hedges that we have, another $1.7 billion that's pre-tax and capital, but once you make the
decision, you have to live by it, and that's okay. So, to the extent that we see opportunities to terminate those

swaps, we would take that gain, it would be deferred and amortized in the income, therefore capital over the
remaining life of the swaps which as I mentioned earlier are five-year tenors.
So, that would only be in a case where you solve the probability of rates increasing, and then we'd get ahead of
that. That does not seem to be the case at this point in time, but you're asking the right question. There will come
a point in time where we do that. Remember that the hedges are to protect net income from being degraded as a
result of low-interest rate environment, it's not an incremental. It's trying to protect what we do have. And so, while
we're enjoying that protection, there's no need for us to try in front-end gains and use that for capital actions. It's
to sustain our profile and our consistency of generating PPNR.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Can you just talk about some of your expense levers that you can pull while a lot of things are shut
down and there's obviously a lot of emphasis on employees. But you've had kind of continuous improvement on
expenses for several years and just talk about some of the things that you can look at in the environment here.
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah, Matt. So, we've continued to be focused on expense management. I think we've done a really good job
there. If you look at our top categories, salaries and benefits, occupancy and furniture fixtures and equipment, the
places we've been able to reduce expenses have been attached to our branches. We've consolidated a whole lot
more branches than we've opened up. We continue to look at that and continue to have – we have a whole group
of people focused on our retail network strategy to make sure that we're optimizing that network from a revenue
and growth generation, as well as cost optimization.
So you should expect us to continue there. We have continued to reduce square footage. We're down some
300,000 square feet in the quarter. We'll be down another [ph] 600,000 to 700,000 square feet (00:39:44) for the
full year, and we're learning some things working from home, and we really had missed a beat in terms of
efficiency and effectiveness. So, I had mentioned in the prepared comments kind of hoteling and maybe there's
an opportunity for us to continue to ramp that up even more so.
Our vendors spend, we continue to have programs in place to control and reduce vendor cost, in particular on the
demand management side of things. So I think we have 73 initiatives that we've identified in continuous
improvement. I'd mentioned we were through 40% of those; actually, we're through about 32 of them. We'll
complete another 14 this year. So, John has asked us to figure out how we get better at whatever we do,
wherever you are at the bank, how do you do it better tomorrow than you did today. And so, I think you should

continue to see us look for ways to become more efficient and effective over time. So, we have some ways to
continue to work on the expense side.

John M. Turner, Jr. A

And I would just add, Matt, we've seen a lot of change and improvement over the last four, five weeks as we've
accelerated the need to react the way we serve our customers. And so, I think it bodes well for continued process
improvement. With process improvement, [ph] we can gain (00:41:11) greater efficiency. We're absolutely
committed to – in fact, we're managing expenses all the time, but particularly during this period of some great
uncertainty.

recovery?

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Barbara I. Godin A
Senior Executive Vice President, Deputy Chief Risk Officer and Chief Credit Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Sure. Good morning, Jennifer. You know, as we look at the energy bucket as an example, we know that right now
that there is acute demand dislocation. However, on the other hand, you also have OPEC, which came out and
reduced the supply by 9.7 million barrels. And then we combine that with the opening of the economy, which
we're [ph] hoping will help (00:42:12) – should happen soon and that's going to help with demand and with some
stabilization in prices. I'd also point to this the book that we now have, the fact that majority of it is now midstream
and primary E&P in the senior secured position, no second lien positions, et cetera, that you're feeling pretty good
about that book.
We actually stressed that, Jennifer, down to $24 a barrel. We also know we're in a contango market, so we do
anticipate higher future prices as well. So, we also know that crude storage is an issue. So, we've got our eyes on
energy. We're managing again on a day-to-day basis. Are we going to see some more energy losses? Probably,
but [indiscernible] (00:42:55) our E&P book, we've only taken $5 million of losses since 2012 for E&P. The one
that we have this quarter, we saw the loss numbers. It was roughly $21 million loss to an E&P customer

[indiscernible] (00:43:13) grouping, but it was a Master Limited Partnership, so not truly E&P per se and [ph] it
was a (00:43:17) shared national credit as well. So we do see some of our non-performing loans goal are going to
increase and criticized and classified, they're going to increase, but in terms of [ph] surge-offs while we know
(00:43:30) [indiscernible] (00:43:31), we think they'll be well under control.
Let me talk to you a second on restaurant, restaurant, it's often said that – primarily for restaurants, it's going to be
[indiscernible] (00:43:44) quick serve and fast casual, et cetera, what we know is our quick serve is down 20% to
30%, fast casual is down 30% to 40% right now, [ph] 52% of our restaurant outstandings are well (00:43:57)
secured, and we know that the full-service restaurants right now are experiencing the greatest impact. So, again
saying that, we know there's going to be [indiscernible] (00:44:10) they're going to be pretty well controlled

Good morning, Peter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Good morning. Can you just talk about some of your economic assumptions, what you're
assuming, and I'm just curious if you cut it off on March 31, because we've just seen the recent economic
forecasts have gone a little bit worse?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, Peter, given the significant economic volatility associated with COVID-19, we ran several economic
scenarios to determine our allowance for credit losses. We also used third-party comparisons, in particular
Moody's March 27 comparison. Our models really weren't built for this type of change. So we knew we are going
to have to have some overlays on top of that to get to what we thought was an appropriate allowance for credit
losses. There has been a lot of discussion in terms of what we think about the recovery and what shape it is and
really we think a better question would be not the shape of the curve, but at what pace does it actually recover to
pre-recession levels and we'll call pre-recession being the fourth quarter of 2019. So we have pretty severe
numbers of GDP approaching that 20% in the second quarter, unemployment approaching the 10%. And while it
does, we do expect it to recover, we expect that it's going to be very slow.
If you go back to the financial crisis, it took about 14 quarters before we got back to pre-recession GDP. Our
expectation is it's going to be somewhere between 10 and 12 quarters before we get back there, so call it, the
latter part of 2022. So we do not think this snaps back, we think it's prolonged. We get better from the second
quarter, right. So you start to come up, but you're just not going to come up at the pace that you just went down.

Therefore, it can't be a V. It's going to be – I don't know what the symbol is, but to call the check mark more so

Good morning, Erika.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi. Good morning. My question is for Barb, if I could. So the last time Regions went through DFAST, the nine
quarter loss rate was 3.9% under severely adverse versus the Fed runs has at 6.5%. And I can see the historical
bias in the CRE bucket, but I'm wondering Barb, if you could give us a sense of what the difference is particularly
in where they think your C&I loss rate would be in such a scenario versus yours, it's a pretty wide gap there and in
the most impacted industries that you outlined for us is a cumulative loss rate over two years of around 6% to 7%
like we saw in the GFC fair or do you think there's just strong enough underwriting that would preclude that
scenario from unfolding?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Barbara I. Godin A
Senior Executive Vice President, Deputy Chief Risk Officer and Chief Credit Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Well, we always know firstly, Jennifer (sic) [Erika] (00:47:54) that we're always going to have increased losses
during these times of stress. So I'll start with that and we also know and I feel really comfortable on this thing that
is the fact that our underwriting has changed, our risk management is really strong. The entire company is
focused on overall risk management, so we are going to perform better than in entire period.
If we look at what our DFAST losses were, I'll just use 2018 maybe as a bellwether and somebody had used that
in one of their analysis. And at the time, they said the – that – or turning off – I'm sorry my allowance is $1.665
billion and the 2018 DFAST losses at the time were $3.1 billion. So that's roughly 55% in a severe adverse
environment of that. And I think that's pretty good. I think it's going to range somewhere between the high 40s and
somewhere into the 50s. So again, generally feeling comfortable with those numbers. Did I answer your question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Yeah. I guess just wanted to clarify what you think the primary differences are in terms of what the Fed sees in
your portfolio, in terms of the worse loss experience. And also trying to figure out the upper bound of cumulative
losses in those most impacted sectors that you outlined in your presentation.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Barbara I. Godin A
Senior Executive Vice President, Deputy Chief Risk Officer and Chief Credit Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think the biggest difference between what we look at and what the Fed looks at, so even though we take
history into account, the Fed models are much more heavily biased towards history, which is the reason I started

with, we are a change company. We're not going back to 2009, 2010, 2011 outlook areas – those periods, but
those were our highest loss histories which are currently filling the models in the Fed model. As you know, they
don't disclose how they arrive at their models. So we have to make some assumptions and we know that there's
still a fairly heavy weighting on that, whereas we have probably less of a weighting on that especially given all of
our performance since then has been much better.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Erica, I'd just add. This is John. We've spent a lot of time I think as you know focused on client selectivity, on risk
adjusted returns, on balance and diversity, on de-risking. If you look across our portfolios, we don't have any
meaningful concentrations in my view anyway in any particular asset classes, we have a rigorous capital planning
and stress testing process. We are applying stresses against our portfolio and making observations about it
based upon what we know today. The provision and the reserves that we're currently provision – we experienced
the reserves we're currently holding reflect our expectation of losses given what we know. If the economic
environment that exists currently persists, then it is very possible that we could see some additional provisioning.
But we do believe our loss experience will be much better. As to why our own projections are different from the
Fed, we're always trying to figure that out. And we still have I think work to do to better understand, we've been
advocating and the Fed is responding to giving us more transparency into their assumptions and their work
because we think that'll be helpful. If there's a real difference between what they believe and what we believe we
need to understand what that is, so that we can react to it. And so just purely from a standpoint of regulatory
relationships, it is something that we continue to advocate for.

Hey guys. Hey, good morning. I just have a very specific question on Ascentium. So you're taking your CECL

and we'll – that's our best estimate for that adjustment at this time.

Good morning, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. Question on the credit side, based upon that we got new Moody's data that come out after the
quarter close, does that point to a likelihood of an additional reserve build in the second quarter? And then
separately, could you give us a little bit of detail what type of loan loss reserve you have against some of those
higher risk portfolios that you mentioned on those slides in the back of the deck? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Yes. So from a second quarter standpoint, we did the best we could coming up with what we believe to be an
appropriate CECL provision for the life of the loan at March 31st taking in all available evidence. Clearly as John
just mentioned, if things persist at this level and the stimulus doesn't work or didn't work to the degree we're
saying there is a risk that we provide over charge-offs in subsequent quarters. The question is we just need to
wait and see what it looks like at the end of June. We can't – every day is a new day, this is a very volatile
environment. So things continue to trend worse at this point in time, but we also have $5.1 trillion of stimulus
going into the system, which compares to about $2.1 trillion in the last crisis and that would remind everybody that
$2.1 trillion came overtime. This $5.1 trillion has come pretty quickly. And now the government is continuing to
look at additional ways to provide stimulus. So what does it all mean? It's just hard to estimate. So, we can't
conclude right now that we would have an adjustment over charge-offs but that's reasonably possible given if
things trend like this, that's a likely event. What was the second part of your question?

breakout for mortgage, credit card, indirect auto and so forth. But I don't have that John at that – we can get that

Managing Director, Assistant Director of Research, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC
Hey, good morning guys. Appreciate all the color on the energy in the restaurant books. Just maybe digging a
little bit deeper, I was just wondering, how far along you are in that borrowing base redetermination process at this
point, if you have a sense for where the new deck is, how much lines have contracted for those customers? And
then just on the restaurant book, if you've been able to do a full review of that book as well, and if you have a
sense for how many customers may no longer be operating at this point and just how you project [indiscernible]
(00:57:51) should be for that, if you assume some of those guys come back into business? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. Barb, you want to respond to that question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Barbara I. Godin A
Senior Executive Vice President, Deputy Chief Risk Officer and Chief Credit Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. For the energy book, we are roughly a quarter of the way through the borrowing base redetermination for
the season. So far we've seen that for borrowing bases the [indiscernible] (00:58:11) down about 12.5%. So we
know that there's clearly some impact there. We should be through the rest of our books in the course of the next
month, month-and-a-half, so we can always give more color at that point in time.
On the restaurant book, we've also looked at each client individually, because there aren't that many clients, and
so we are talking to them on a regular basis: daily, weekly, monthly right now; make sure we have our handle on
that. We do see some continued pressure on full service in particular. As I said quick service is a lot better, but
the full service portfolio which has got, as I said the most impact is really because the restaurants are closed. So
until the economy opens up, we're going to continue to see some pressure there and we're going to continue to
see some losses there; albeit, we believe they're very manageable and containable.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Managing Director, Assistant Director of Research, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC

Yeah. I don't have the exact number that are closed at this minute, but in the restaurant book, we have 3,600
customers in total; and of that it would be somewhere, a portion of that obviously. And in terms of close, it's hard
to count. Do I count each individual shop in terms of someone who's got multiple units and they've only closed
one or two, et cetera, so that becomes a little bit of a tricky answer to that question. But, yes, there are a handful
probably in the nature of 10 to 20 right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. The only thing I would add just sort of points you to our slide number – on page 23, I think, as Barb says
the bulk of the casual dining portfolio represented by about 34 customers is just over $0.5 billion in exposure, 21%
of that portfolio is currently criticized and that reflects our view of the risk in that portfolio today based upon what
we know.

Hey, wanted to dig down a little deeper maybe into some of the impacts from some of the government programs,
and I know it's kind of hard to say. But in regulatory release and maybe specifically on the payment deferrals if
you have a percentage amount of your loans that are in deferral currently and how you think those pan out maybe
90, 180 days down the line if those do become TDRs down the line, and then with the Main Street Lending
Program in particular how might that impact your syndicated loan book and those people's ability to kind of borrow
additional fund if they don't refinance yet?

John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
So maybe I'll work backwards. I think there's a lot of interest in the Main Street Lending program; we have a team
working on better understanding the guidelines and how it will apply. I don't know that we have a real good feel
yet for how many customers will awfully be interested and how that might affect our customer base; but clearly
one of a number of programs that the government and/or Congress have made available to customers that will be
helpful over time. I can't remember the first part of your question now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Turner, Jr. A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp.
Payment deferrals.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Oh, payment deferrals. So with our business customers and we've now granted about 4,000 deferrals, 3,000 to
small businesses, about 1,000 to middle market customers. So our approach there is to treat those customers on
a case-by-case basis to evaluate the ongoing [indiscernible] (01:02:02) of their business. And if prior to the
pandemic starting they had a viable business and were doing well, we're a good customer then we'll typically
grant them a deferral and in some instances that might be for up to six months. Generally, they're 90 day
deferrals, interest only typically and then we revisit those at the end of that period, but that is specific to customers
who were in good standing prior to the pandemic beginning and they clearly appear to have what we believe to be
a viable business after the pandemic whenever that is.
On the consumer side, we're generally offering deferrals for 90 days to customers. At the end of that 90 day
period, we'll think as I mentioned we've granted 4,000 deferrals in our own balance sheet mortgage book, another
12,000 deferrals for the mortgage portfolio that we service for others and about 13,000 deferrals of other
consumer credit whether it be credit cards, installment loans, home equity lines, et cetera, which is roughly a little
less – on the mortgage portfolio, a little less than $900 million and that's a $14.5 billion portfolio. I think I got the
number right? So that gives you some perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Barbara I. Godin A
Senior Executive Vice President, Deputy Chief Risk Officer and Chief Credit Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. And this is Barb, just to give you some percentages based on what John said, on the mortgage portfolio for
our own book, it's about 7.5% of our accounts have been deferred on the commercial corporate book at 6% and
the consumer book is 2.2% just given the large number of consumers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
And I think on our mortgage book, Barb, half of the loans that have been deferred, the loan to value is less than
50%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Barbara I. Godin A
Senior Executive Vice President, Deputy Chief Risk Officer and Chief Credit Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
That is correct.

Operator: Your next question is from Bill Carcache of Nomura.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Nomura Securities
Hi. Good morning. My main question is on how much you think the Payment Protection Program will really benefit
credit performance on the consumer side of your business? I'm curious because employees who are participating
in PPP are getting those benefits in lieu of what would otherwise be unemployment insurance which suggests I
think that PPP may be understating the level of initial claims. I was curious to hear your thoughts on that and
since we know historically high level of initial claims are associated with elevated consumer credit losses, I just
wondered whether you had any perspective on whether the payment behavior of employees participating in PPP
help you guys minimize credit losses on the consumer side of your business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. It's completely anecdotal. As I talked to customers some have furloughed employees that they intend to
bring back if they get funding out of the PPP program, and so those employees likely went and applied for
unemployment, but may get an opportunity to come back at some point. And so you have that subset versus the
group that have been maintaining their workforce on an ongoing basis and are hopeful to get PPP funding in
order to continue to employ those teams.
As you know the funding is typically for about an eight-week period. And so, I think as we look at the program, we
think it is very helpful. In the short run, there's a tremendous amount of interest in the program, way more interest
in need for funding that has been appropriated to-date. We're very hopeful that Congress will appropriate some
more money to help small business. I would say that in the short run, I do think that it will have a positive impact,
both on consumers small businesses and as a result the corresponding credit that we have. But I don't think it's a
solution three or four months from now if they're not – [indiscernible] (01:06:15) other funding that comes behind it
in some way shape or form.

Operator: Your final question comes from Christopher Marinac of Janney Montgomery.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John M. Turner, Jr. A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Director of Research, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Thanks. Hey, just wanted to ask about the CECL forecast period. If Barb could walk us through that. Does that
work against you with the new numbers on unemployment or was that already factored at the end of March?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Barbara I. Godin A
Senior Executive Vice President, Deputy Chief Risk Officer and Chief Credit Officer, Regions Financial Corp.
Yeah. For CECL, we did the nine quarter losses. We have a two year reversing period. So we looked at nine
quarters as compared to CCAR which was nine quarters, so it's not a lot of different. And really what we did and I
can quickly talk about that.
As we look at several different internally developed economic forecasts that we did as well as industry stress level
analysis where I've included Moody's critical pandemic that came out recently and then both of those looking at
those gave us a range of potential losses due to what's going to happen in COVID. And then, we took those
outlook which included again both acute economic stress in the immediate term as well as in the general
recession type outlook.
And our analysis reflected the key economic variables to our models for our base forecast as well as an abrupt
recession and typical recession et cetera. So again a lot of different inputs to help inform us for a potential range
of future charge-offs and then we performed specific stresses on sectors we believe would be most impacted. So
as an example, when these are included but not limited to energy, restaurants, hotels, manufacturing, retail trade.
And again came up with what we felt was our best number, this was the $250 million over charge-off. By the way
this is the process I just walked through that we rely on when we're doing our CCAR and doing our capital
planning, which is why we feel good about the process given we've been doing capital planning now for years and
years and have a very strong, very solid profit there, and again it incorporates what we're seeing here coming out
of CECL, – coming out of what's happening with the COVID environment.
