Eric Wasserstrom
Vice President & Head of Investor Relations, Discover Financial Services
Thank you, Ashley, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's call. I'll begin on slide 2 of our earnings
presentation which you can find in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website,
investorrelations.discover.com.
Our discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that
may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements that
appear in our third quarter earnings press release and presentation.
Our call today will include remarks from our CEO, Roger Hochschild, and John Greene, our Chief Financial
Officer. After we conclude our formal comments, there'll be time for a question-and-answer session. During the
Q&A session, we request that you ask one question followed by one follow-up question. After your follow-up
question, please return to the queue.
Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Roger.

Thank you, Eric, and thanks to our listeners for joining today's call. We had another period of strong financial
results in the third quarter with earnings of $1.1 billion after tax or $3.54 per share. In many respects, these
results reflected the unique benefits of our integrated digital banking and payments model, which continues to be
a source of significant competitive advantage by supporting our value proposition to consumers and merchants
and differentiating our brand.
These advantages enabled our continued investment in account acquisition, technology and analytics, while
generating substantial capital. In an environment characterized by new entrants and intensifying competition, we
believe the strengths of our model position us to accelerate our growth.
Underlying our results this quarter were three important advancements. The first was our return to year-over-year
receivables growth, which was driven by our investment in acquisition and brand marketing and continued strong
sales trends. Total sales were up 27% over 2019 levels with strong momentum across all categories. Even travel
sales increased; and while they dropped a bit in August due to concerns related to the Delta variant, travel has
steadily improved since then.

We also continued to see attractive opportunities for account acquisition and increased our marketing investment
to take advantage of this. While the competitive environment has intensified, new accounts are now up 17% over
2019, reflecting the strength of our value proposition. This value proposition remains anchored in our industry-
leading onshore customer service model, no annual fees and useful and transparent rewards. While some of our
peers had to reinvigorate their rewards offerings at substantial cost, our rewards costs were up only 6 basis points
year-over-year and nearly all of this increase was driven by higher consumer spending as evidenced in our strong
discount revenue.
Given these dynamics, we will continue investing in new accounts, as long as the environment supports profitable
opportunities and a robust account growth and our expectations for modest improvement in payment rates
supports our view of stronger receivables growth in 2022.
The second key trend was credit, which remained exceptionally strong. Our disciplined approach to credit
management and favorable economic trends contributed to a record low net charge-off rate and continued low
delinquencies. The delinquency outlook affirmed our expectations that losses will be below last year's levels for
the full year and supported additional reserve releases during the quarter.
And third is the continued expansion of our payments business. PULSE saw a meaningful increase in debit
volume with 9% growth year-over-year and a 26% increase over the third quarter of 2019, demonstrating both the
impact of the recovery and an increase in debit use through the pandemic.
Our Diners business has also started to see some improvement from the global recovery with volume up 12%
from the prior year. As the global economy recovers, we will continue to look for opportunities to expand our
international reach.
In summary, our value proposition continues to be attractive and our integrated digital banking and payments
model supports profitable long-term customer relationships and is highly capital generative. I continue to feel very
good about our prospects for future growth.
I'll now ask John to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail.

John T. Greene
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Thank you, Roger, and good morning, everyone. Once again, our results this quarter reflect strong execution and
the continued economic recovery.
Looking at our financial summary results on page 4, there are three key things I want to call out. First, our total
revenue, net of interest expense, is up 8% from the prior year, excluding a $167 million unrealized loss due to
market adjustments on our equity investments. Including this, revenue is up 2% for the quarter.
Second is a continuation of very strong credit performance. Net charge-offs were down $343 million from the prior
year, which supported a $165 million reserve release this quarter. Lastly, we continue investing for growth with
increased marketing spend. Higher operating expenses in other area were largely related to the economic
recovery. I'll go over the details of our quarterly results in our full year outlook on the following slides.
Looking at loan growth on slide 5, we saw the return to growth this quarter with ending loans up 1% over the prior
year and up 2% sequentially. Card loans were the primary driver and were also up 1% year-over-year and 2%
over the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase in card receivables was driven by strong sales volume and

robust account acquisitions. Sales growth continued to accelerate and was up 27% over the third quarter of 2019.
Year-to-date, new accounts were up 27% from the prior year and up 17% over 2019 levels.
The contribution from these factors was mostly offset by the ongoing high payment rates as household savings
and cash flows remain elevated. The payment rate was approximately 500 basis points over pre-pandemic levels.
We anticipate that the payment rate will moderate a bit as most federal COVID support programs have ended and
consumer savings rates have started to decrease. That said, we expect payment rates to remain above historical
levels through 2022.
Looking at our other lending products, organic student loans increased 4% from the prior year with originations up
7%, as most schools have returned to the normal, in-person learning model. Personal loans decreased 4%,
driven by high payment rates. Our underwriting criteria have returned to pre-pandemic levels, and we expect a
return to growth in this product in future periods.
Moving to slide 6, net interest margin was 10.8%, up 61 basis points from the prior year and 12 basis points from
the prior quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, the increase in net interest margin was primarily driven by lower
interest charge-offs and lower funding costs. This was partially offset by a higher mix of promotional rate
balances.
Card loan yield was up 1 basis point sequentially as lower interest charge-offs were offset by the increased
promotional balance mix. Yield on personal loans declined 15 basis points sequentially due to lower pricing. The
margin continued to benefit from lower funding costs, primarily driven by maturities of higher rate CDs and an
increased mix of lower rate savings and money market balances.
Average consumer deposits were flat year-over-year and declined 1% from the prior quarter. The quarter-over-
quarter decline was largely driven by consumer CDs. We also saw a slight decline in savings and money market
deposits as consumers continued to spend excess levels of liquidity.
We also continued to optimize our funding stack. Late in September, we executed our first ABS issuance since
October 2019, consisting of a $1.2 billion security with a three-year fixed rate coupon of 58 basis points and a
five-year $600 million security with a fixed coupon of 103 basis points. These were our lowest ABS coupons ever
and show good execution and timing by our treasury team.
Looking at revenue on slide 7, total non-interest income increased $90 million or 20% over the prior year,
excluding the unrealized loss on equity investments. Net discount and interchange revenue was up $61 million or
26%, driven by strong sales volume. This was partially offset by increased rewards costs due to high sales in the
5% category which was restaurants and PayPal, both this year and last. We continue to benefit from strong sales
through our partnership with PayPal, while restaurant sales were up 62% year-over-year as dining activity
recovered. Loan fee income was up $21 million or 21%, primarily driven by lower late fee charge-offs and higher
non-sufficient funds and cash advance fees.
Looking at slide 8, total operating expenses were up $185 million or 18% from the prior year. The details reflect
our focus on investing for future growth while managing our operating costs. Employee compensation increased
$12 million, driven by a higher bonus accrual in the current year. Excluding bonuses, employee compensation
was down 3% from the prior year from lower head count. Marketing expense increased $70 million, supporting
another quarter of strong new account growth.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2021
Other expense included a $50 million legal accrual. Professional fees were up $47 million, primarily due to higher
recovery fees. Courts reopening combined with strong credit and economic conditions have driven an increase in
recoveries and their associated fees. Year-to-date, recoveries were up 20% compared to the prior year. The
benefit of these costs is reflected in lower credit losses.
Moving to slide 9, the trend of sustained strong credit performance continued. Total net charge-offs were a record
low at 1.46%, down 154 basis points year-over-year and 66 basis points sequentially. Total net charge-off dollars
decreased $343 million from the prior year and were down $131 million quarter-over-quarter. Credit performance
was strong across all products as evidenced by the net charge-off rates on card, private student loans and
personal loans.
Moving to the allowance for credit losses on slide 10, this quarter, we released $165 million from reserves and our
reserve rate dropped 35 basis points to 7.7%. The reserve release reflects continued strong credit performance
and a largely stable macroeconomic outlook. The impact of these was partially offset by a 2% increase in loans
from the prior quarter.
Our economic assumptions include an unemployment rate of approximately 5.5% by year-end and GDP growth of
just over 6%. These assumptions were slightly less positive than those used in the second quarter but still reflect
a strong economic outlook.
Looking at slide 11, our Common Equity Tier 1 for the period was 15.5%, well above our 10.5% target. We
repurchased $815 million of common stock and, as we had previously announced, increased our dividend
payable by 14% to $0.50 per share. These actions reflect our commitment to returning capital to our
shareholders. On funding, we continue to make progress towards our goals of having deposits be 70% to 80% of
our funding mix. Deposits now make up 68% of total funding, up from 62% in the prior year.
Wrapping up on slide 12, our outlook for 2021 has not changed and reflects continued strong execution against
our financial and strategic objectives. In summary, we remain well positioned for profitable growth from improving
loan trends. Credit performance trends remain favorable, reflecting positive macroeconomic conditions and our
approach to underwriting and credit management. Investments for growth have supported a significant increase in
new accounts while we've contained operating expenses.
Lastly, our integrated digital banking and payments model is highly capital generative, allowing us to invest for
growth and return capital to shareholders. We look forward to providing our outlook for 2022 on our conference
call in January.
With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator, Ashley, to open the line for Q&A.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please
go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Good morning. I want to see if you can give us a little more color on your payment rate expectations. I know
you're expecting to remain elevated through 2022. But just want to see if you're starting see signs of accounts that
typically revolve, start to see some declines in payment rates there. And then, I guess, how material of an
inflection you think we can see through 2022? Or do you think that's not likely until 2023? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Great. All right. Thanks for the question. So, the payment rate has been persistently high. And what we did see in
the month of September was that that ticked down mildly. It did increase from July to August, which was, frankly,
a bit of a surprise. But as I look at the data we're seeing here in terms of revolve and the forecasted trends, my
expectation is that, in the fourth quarter, it will continue to step down. Some of that has to do with government
support programs ending in September, and some of it has to do with the holiday season.
And then, as we look beyond the holiday season into 2022, I do expect that it will continue to step towards a
normalized rate. But, frankly, I don't think that will happen until 2023. So, how do we think about the implications
from that? Certainly, the payment rate is a bit of a headwind to growth. But what we've seen is really strong
account acquisition and strong sales growth, which to date has helped offset some of that payment rate impact.
So, overall, we feel very, very comfortable that the balance of 2021 and then 2022 will have a bit of tailwind
related to both payment rates declining and then strong execution from the new accounts and sales growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Got it. Okay. Thanks, John. And then, on the account acquisition front, I know you indicated that you expect
marketing costs to be higher in the second half. So, if you can give us a little bit more detail around the
expectation there and how they could trend for the fourth quarter? And then does that imply that you could see
some continued upside pressure into 2022 on marketing as you drive account acquisition in light of pressured
payment rates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Yeah. So, from a marketing standpoint, we spend the money as we see opportunity to drive profitable new
accounts. And frankly, we've had a great quarter and a great year with that. The third quarter spend actually came
in mildly lower than what we originally anticipated.
And the guidance I had provided on the last call was that we would approximate the 2019 levels of total marketing
expense. I think it will be a little bit under that – a bit under that largely not because of opportunities, but basically
kind of some process-oriented stuff in terms of account targeting. So we feel like the money we'll spend in the
7

fourth quarter will certainly generate positive new account growth. It will pick up from third quarter certainly and
provide us a good trajectory for 2022.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Roger, you talked about intense competition and the impact of new entrants. Can you maybe just expand on
those points about what you're seeing competitively? How you think Discover is positioned for it? And where do
you believe this is having the biggest impact on your business and how are you responding for it? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Sure. Thanks for the question. I think my actual comment was good growth in the face of intense competition, and
I think really sums it up well. The competition in the card business is always intense. We were lucky enough to
have a lapse in 2020, and so saw extraordinarily good cost per account, but it's what we're used to facing.
It will vary based on which issuers are refreshing their cards or have more of a desire than growth – for growth
than others. But I think our focus on a clear, differentiated value proposition has resulted in continued strong
generation of new accounts, and I'm excited about what I see.
In terms of the new entrants, we see that less in the core credit card space, but I would say very, very aggressive
competition around personal loans. And that's an area where we focused on the long-term, remain disciplined in
our underwriting and what we're willing to invest in new accounts and are used to seeing competitors come and
go.

Ryan M. Nash Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. And if I could ask a follow-up question to the question John asked prior. So, John, in terms of marketing,
the level you'd be hitting in the fourth quarter as it steps up a little bit, should we think about that as a go-forward
run rate? Are there more investments that needed to be made?
And then second, there was comments about BTs increasing as it relates to marketing. Can you maybe just help
us understand where are we today versus pre-pandemic levels? And what is the strategy to continue to increase
balance transfer activity on the go-forward basis? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Sure. On the marketing spend, that will be determined – they are determined based on the opportunities we see.
As we look at 2022, we do see a continued benign credit environment and, frankly, a very strong opportunity to
drive profitable new account growth. So, as that opportunity continues to persist, we'll continue to spend
marketing dollars.
So, what I would suggest is we concentrate here on 2021. And then in the January call, we'll talk about 2022 in
terms of the opportunities there. But I'll leave you with this point that the fourth quarter trajectory should help
inform what we intend to spend in 2022.
In terms of balance transfers, we did see an impact from some of the increased balance transfers that we
executed in early part of 2021 in the third quarter in terms of mild impacts to margin. We'll continue to take a look
at that space and see what we can generate profitably. It's been a good source of account acquisition for us
historically. And we'll continue to remain disciplined and put those prime revolver accounts on the balance
transfer.

Hi. Good morning. I guess, Roger, a little bit of a longer-term question around your debit business. It seems like
we're going to have more direct to bank payments in the United States over time, and there's a lot going on;
PayPal potentially buying Pinterest. Can you talk about how you see debit evolving over the long term? And are
there any implications given that you own a network?

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2021
Sure. Great question. There are always, I would say, new payment schemes and methods out there. A lot of them
though tend to rely on existing payments. So you think about when Apple launched their wallet, even PayPal, the
vast majority of their volume is processed through existing payment networks. And debit processing is incredibly
complex and, quite frankly, very low margin and very efficient as you look at how sort of the three major debit
networks, us, Mastercard and Visa operate.
And right now, given the interchange caps that a lot of banks have, the economics for them are relatively thin. So
while we look at what the Fed might be proposing, what goes on in other markets, I don't see anything in the near
or even medium term that looks like it has the potential. And quite frankly, you're starting to see an increase in
volume on the debit side, even a lot of the buy now pay later players are leveraging debit for their payments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
You don't see debit really going away per se and being replaced by direct-to-account payments in the US?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
No. The risk management of payments is quite complex in terms of both fraud and identity. There are a lot of
processes and controls that the major networks have in place. There's a robust ecosystem if you think about
point-of-sale devices, merchant acquirers. And so to think that that will change suddenly I see as a low probability.

Hi. Hey, Roger, just following up on that, is there an opportunity for you to take your debit network and debit
capabilities and expand it into that new – I wouldn't call it new, I guess, but into that revitalized interest in debit
that we're seeing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Great question, Betsy. Certainly, we have a unique set of network assets and can provide connectivity to
merchants, whether through proxy card numbers or a series of other technologies. And work closely with a
number of fintechs around that. So that's at the core of some of what we do with Sezzle.
Actually, that was the beginning of our relationship with Marqeta many, many years ago. And there are a lot of
others that are either in the market now or that we're in discussions with. So I think the PULSE and the debit
assets we have, combined with our signature network, are an advantage and one that we look to monetize.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2021
Okay. And then as we're thinking about the dance that's coming over the next couple of years between loan
growth and credit normalization. Can you help us understand how you're thinking about managing that trajectory?
Because what I heard earlier in the call is you've been getting more and more efficient at account acquisition,
right?
Part of your marketing spend coming in lower than expected or at least lower than consensus than we expected is
a function of you doing something; I don't know if it's cloud or technology or what to get more efficient at account
targeting and account acquisition. So, on the one hand, you've got that running in a very positive direction.
You talked about the payment rates being a little bit of a headwind to monetizing that. But, at the same time,
we've got credit normalizing. So is there an opportunity for you to pull levers on marketing to generate some more
loan growth? Or is it more likely to come from the personal loan side or the student loan side? As credit's
normalizing, how should we think about how you're managing that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Hey, Betsy. I'll take this one. So there's a lot to that question. So let me just give a view in terms of what
we're seeing as we closed out the third quarter. So, as I mentioned, the payment rate is stepping down. And from
August to September, we expect that to continue. That will help certainly drive loan growth.
My sense is today that there's a relationship between the payment rate and sales activity. So the persistently high
payment rate, I think, has driven sales activity across the industry. Now, we benefited, I would say, slightly
disproportionately in terms of driving incremental sales, partly due to the acquisition point you mentioned.
So there's two dynamics. The third dynamic is credit normalizing. And my sense is that credit normalization will
continue through 2022 into 2023. So, today, where I sit, I'm positive on credit. So those factors in the aggregate,
in addition to the point you mentioned in terms of account targeting, I think, position us pretty well in 2022 for
positive loan growth. Now, the specifics will come in a little bit later in January when we give our view, but we're
all positive on that front today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And could you touch on what was driving that account acquisition being more efficient? You mentioned the
process-oriented improvement. So what specifically are you talking about there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
So, Betsy, it's Roger again. A lot of the enhancements that we're seeing are leveraging the advanced analytics.
And so that's really helping both on the underwriting side with sort of swap-in, swap-outs as well as better
targeting, combined with investments we're making from beginning to end in the martech stack. And we think
those are already serving us well, but there's also plenty of upside as we continue to focus on that area.

Good morning.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
I wanted to follow-up on your conviction in more robust loan growth in 2022. If we were to get even just modest
mid-single-digit spending growth next year, do you think the incremental tailwind from payment rate normalization
could be enough to support double-digit loan growth? And just to clarify on this point, did you say earlier, John,
that you think we could see payment rates get back to sort of normalized maybe 2019 levels by the end of 2023?
Is that a reasonable expectation?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
So, 2023 is the horizon that we're looking at for payment rate to normalize. And when that happens, we expect
savings rate to return to normalized levels. So one view is, continue to watch the savings rate, and that should
help inform payment rate. That's frankly one of the metrics we look at.
In terms of robust loan growth in 2022, let me just put it this way here because we're going to hold off until
January on providing explicit details. But the new account originations have been important for growth. Sales
activity has been important for growth. The payment rate, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, has been a
headwind, not completely unanticipated. We did see it mildly higher than what we had modeled, but we're still on
track for delivering the loan growth that we talked about for 2021, 2022, it will be informed by all those factors and
shared, Bill, in more detail in January.

Bill Carcache Q

Understood. If I can follow-up on a separate question on BNPL risk. I guess there's a group on one side that
thinks that it's largely customers who can't qualify for credit and are just using BNPL to turn their debit cards into
credit cards. We've heard the CEO of Sezzle, which we know is one of your partners, sort of speak to that point.
And then there's this other group that is more concerned about the competitive threat posed by certain BNPL
players that do longer-term installment lending and the risk that they'll eat into margins and pricing over time. Can
you frame for us how you're thinking about the competitive threat? And now that you've had a little bit more time
to study what's happening with the different BNPL players.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Sure. So I'll start with the end there. While we've had more time to study it, I'd say the market is not yet mature.
And I think market clearing economics have yet to be established. Part of the challenge is there are many
segments within buy now pay later from the people financing a multi-thousand-dollar purchase, which, by the way,

they've done for years in terms of traditional sales finance versus sort of more spreading out payments on $60
worth of cosmetics.
So those segments all have different characteristics. Certainly, at the lower end, there are many customers who
are either debit preferring or do not have access to significant amounts of credit. But I think you'll continue to see
it evolve. You're starting to see some pressure from merchants who are unwilling to pay take rates above what
they pay in card.
So, right now, we certainly see opportunity on the payment side, as I talked about earlier, leveraging our assets.
Over time, we think there may be opportunity for us as an issuer and, again, partially leveraging our unique model
and our proprietary network. But, right now, I would say we're not seeing any noticeable impact on revolving loans
and believe that we are well positioned to respond if it does emerge.

Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on some of Ryan's questions on competition. I guess, Roger, when
you think about the competitive landscape on a go-forward basis, you looked at the post financial crisis period, a
lot of that competition was transactor-oriented like people going after transactor customers. Do you think this time
it's going to be a little bit different given what unfolded last time? Or do you think that it's sort of going to be the
same? I'm just curious as you think about how you're setting up competitively.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Sanjay, I am lucky enough to be able to look back over multiple cycles of competition, and it has varied everything
from sort of an intense focus across the board on prime revolvers to transactors. I think, certainly, American
Express will stay focused on that spend-based model. A lot of banks focus on those transactors because they are
very profitable customers not so much in card, but in other segments of the business.
The prime revolver space has historically been the most challenging in terms of what it requires from a value
proposition and underwriting. For transactors, it's really about rolling out a risk rewards program. So we expect to
see competition across the spectrum. But what impacts us most will be that in the prime revolver space.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And you don't see any of that really intensifying relative to what you anticipated? I mean it's pretty consistent.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2021
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. I would say it's intensified significantly since sort of the lull during the pandemic, but it's now getting back to,
I would say, more normalized levels.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. And then, John, just one follow-up on NIM. I know we're not talking about next year's guidance until next
quarter. But, just broadly speaking, as we sit here today with your NIM at pretty high levels relative to history, as
the growth comes, do you envision that to be a tailwind for the NIM? Or does that start counteracting some of this
because the BT rates increased? I'm just curious sort of how we should think about the progression going
forward. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Thanks, Sanjay. So, if you go back and look at NIM historically, you'll see that it was subjected to, frankly,
higher funding costs from unsecured term debt. What we've tried to do is shore up the liability side of the balance
sheet. So targeting 70%, 80% based on – or from deposits. And then the rest, a combination of secured and
unsecured security offerings. So that will create stability in terms of the funding cost.
In terms of pluses and minuses to the revenue line, what we'll see is some BT-related impacts to NIM. You'll see
credit, if it does normalize, a bit of credit normalization in terms of NIM. But you'll also see that sustained impact
from funding I just talked about.
So, we're looking at NIM to be higher than what we've experienced historically. And we're going to compare 2021
how we end the year in terms of the balance sheet position and see how that impacts 2022. But, overall, I would
say the funding position has created more stability and a economic benefit to investors.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Maybe to start, if we could just clarify a little bit on the
marketing expense guidance, I guess, maybe for the fourth quarter. I understand you don't want to talk about
2022 yet. But, just for the fourth quarter, when you talk about marketing expense relative to 2019 levels, are you
talking on a quarterly basis? So, fourth quarter, we're looking at $235-ish-million?
I understand you may not want to give exact numbers, but should we be thinking on a quarterly basis or on a full-
year basis? Because just given the backup in the first three quarters of the year, that would be a pretty big
increase versus – on a quarterly basis?

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mihir Bhatia Q

So just want to make sure we clarify that. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
So thanks. So, when we referenced 2019, we're talking a full year basis. So then that would force folks to do a
little bit of math on the third quarter and fourth quarter. We came in lower in the third quarter than we anticipated.
Fourth quarter, we expect it will increase from the $210 million. So to, frankly, remove some ambiguity on this, so
it will be somewhere in the range of $220 million to, call it, $280 million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Okay. Understood. Thank you. And then...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
I hesitate to give that level of specificity, but given the confusion, I just wanted to kind of put it away.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mihir Bhatia Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Sure and we appreciate that. Just maybe just taking a step back on the credit side and just longer-term consumer
credit performance. As you underwrite new accounts, can you just talk about what kind of through-the-cycle loss
rate assumptions you're making? I guess what I'm really trying to understand is what is the normalized loss rate
for your credit card portfolio as we think about longer-term economics?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. So, what I would confirm is we do use a through-the-cycle loss rate, and so do not use current losses, but
that's not something we disclose.

Mihir Bhatia Q

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2021
Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks. The pace of spending by your cardholders accelerated a little bit in 3Q relative to 2019. Is that consistent
through the quarter? Or did it show any signs of rising or falling in terms of the cadence there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
We've seen ups and downs. In particular, we talked about a bit of a softening around travel that occurred in
August. And I think that was driven by a lot of what was going on with the pandemic. But we continue to see very
robust sales volume even continuing into October.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. Thanks. And then the comment on the personal loan pricing and the competitive pressures there, is that
mainly from new entrants in the market? We're seeing a lot of different types of personal loan models coming to
market in the past couple of years. Is that something that you would expect to continue as competitive pressure
going forward? Or is this more of a just marking down relative to where the existing book was?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah, a lot of it is coming from new entrants. Personal loans are probably the easiest to fund outside of a bank
and have the easiest servicing requirements. And so, it's where a lot of the new entrants will go with new models.
We are disciplined both on credit but as well as pricing and will not go below the targeted returns we want to hit.
A lot of times that will flush its way through when they either don't get the performance that they want to see or
have other challenges. You do get some times people who are prioritizing growth over returns, but that tends not
to last for too long.

Mark C. DeVries Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks. Just had a question about what you're seeing in the student lending space. And one of your
competitors has noted some headwinds in the quarter. Just how is that shaping up?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
So we feel pretty good about peak season. Volumes were up roughly 7% year-over-year. And we believe that we
gained share, although we're still sort of processing. So, clearly, we saw one major competitor step back last year.
But we're very excited about that market. We underwrite it in a very disciplined way, and it's a great way to get a
really good product in our brand in front of the next generation of prime cardholders.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2021
Mark C. DeVries Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. Got it. And then just a follow-up question on PULSE. As you know, you've had some pretty strong volumes
there. Roger, is there a point at which you start to get some meaningful scale benefits and the earnings
contribution from that becomes more meaningful and grows faster than the volumes?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
We would love to increase the percent of our earnings that comes out of the payments segment. I think one of the
challenges, we also are working pretty hard to increase earnings from our banking segment. So we're not
standing still there either. While we're excited about PULSE, it's also very competitive. We're battling for routing at
the merchant level with Visa and Mastercard day in, day out. We've seen a lot of growth from expanding from
traditional PIN debit to card not present. And so that's been particularly helpful. But, yeah, we're very focused on
growing that business.

Mark C. DeVries Q

Operator: And we'll take our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks. Maybe just to come back to the new account acquisition. Is there – particularly in card, is there a
way to talk about either if there are any different channels that you're using or what's the nature of the consumer?
Are there any differences in the type of consumer that you're seeing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Not really, Moshe. I don't think we've seen anything dramatic since prior to the pandemic. Clearly, the continued
migration to digital channels, direct mail becomes a smaller and smaller piece, but that's been a trend for many
years now. So, we continually are fine-tuning the digital channels.
I guess what we've seen is a greater ability to measure the results of top of funnel spend. As it shifts more digital,
when that spend moves from TV to even video that's online, you can do a better job with tracking and attribution.
And so we are repositioning how we spend, and that's one of the areas we're leveraging some of our advanced
analytics.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Got you. Thank you. And as you mentioned kind of using balance transfer as part of this, can you talk a little bit
about anything that you can share with us in terms of whether they're all at zero, are there some that are at yields
above zero? And any kind of update on what you've seen in terms of retention of those balances?

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2021
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Sure. So, probably one of the bigger trends, there was a real collapse in balance transfer demand during the
pandemic. Clearly, a lot of issuers were pulling back on credit line increases. But I think consumers were much
more focused on paying down their debt versus moving it around. So you saw a softening in demand for personal
loans and balance transfers. That's starting to come back.
For us, a lot of our acquisition offers are at 0%. The portfolio offers tend to either be above zero or have a fee that
provides a pretty effective yield. And as John pointed out, for most of those, we see a very high return from the
balance transfer itself given this funding environment as well as a good percent sticking, and that's something we
model very carefully.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Moshe Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: And we'll take the next question from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominick Gabriele Q
Director & Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Great. Thank you so much for taking my questions. I guess if we just think about the comments around the
economic outlook getting – or the assumptions around your economic outlook becoming slightly worse from the
second quarter to the third quarter, but then being incrementally positive into 2022 credit trends, can you just
square those two pieces together?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. Happy to, Dominick. So when we modeled in the second quarter, frankly, the economy saw a higher level
of GDP growth and employment returning to normalized levels sooner. And when we updated those, the GDP
had come down, employment returning to normalized levels pushed a bit. So that was one of multiple inputs.
We provide that detail because it's, frankly, the most transparent that people can take a look at to get a view of
how we're thinking about the reserves. Now, the other items that are important in terms of our thinking here in the
third quarter was, first, the portfolio performance, and it's been super strong.
Second was the ending of many of the government support programs related to COVID. So most of those ended
in August and September. What we'd like to do is see some seasoning of the impacts of those into the fourth
quarter and perhaps even in the first quarter next year. If what we expect is that the impact of that seasoning will
be very, very mild on the portfolio and the broad macros continue to look favorable, there's enough kind of points
of reference that would lead us to begin to step the reserves back to day one. But a lot of things need to happen.
And we ended up where we were in the third quarter. We ran through multiple models, multiple scenarios and we
got comfortable with where we were to make sure the balance sheet was fairly stated. But we do see that the
broad macros out into the future are positive. So we'll see how they sustain and make a call in the fourth quarter
and in 2022.

Dominick Gabriele Q
Director & Senior Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.
Great. Thanks for that. And if you all think about how the hierarchy of products that you have as well as across
the consumer space for normalization on which products could normalize, perhaps let's just, I don't know, to even
maybe 2019 levels, NCO rates, are there certain products you would expect to normalize either faster than other
products? Or any color you can provide along the trajectory of one product versus the other given what you're
seeing in your customer base would be awesome. Thank you so much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Greene A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. That's a difficult thing to do in that it will be subject to the economic environment. So we know historically,
right, if there's a period of tougher financial situation, the personal loans will be the ones that get the least priority
in terms of payment. Credit cards tend to be high. The student loans given the long duration of those contracts,
they don't seem to gyrate as much with the economic outputs, plus that so much of our portfolio is co-signed that
it provides additional coverage there.
So you get to kind of personal loans subject to the economic environment. And then the card, my sense is the
card has been prioritized in terms of the payment hierarchy because of what has happened in terms of cash in the
digital environment. It's really difficult to shop without a card these days. So I look for stability there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Operator: And our final question will come from Bill Ryan with Seaport Research. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Ryan Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC
Thank you and good morning. A couple of questions. One, on the personal loans business, I believe you've been
in the business since 2007. A lot of new entrants in the marketplace today. You kind of talked about it. But, as I
remember, two-third of your book is roughly from the existing Discover credit card file, but the other third
historically coming from the other place out of market or out of your existing file.
As far as the underwriting you're seeing from the new entrants, you kind of talked a little bit about it, but I was
wondering if you could take a little bit more granular approach to it and talk about are they making compromises
relative to what you're willing to do on credit, payment income, yield verification, all the above?
And second, just kind of going back to the bonus accruals. A lot of companies are stepping up bonuses as
employee retention efforts. Is this something we should kind of view as transitory one-time? Or might this transfer
into a little bit higher compensation expense going into next year? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Roger C. Hochschild A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Discover Financial Services
Yeah. I'll start with the bonus accrual. We haven't made any changes to our bonus program. So, to the extent
there are changes in bonus accrual, it just reflects far stronger financial performance this year versus last year
than how that translates.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2021
In terms of the personal loan space, it is very hard to get line of sight into the practices of these companies and
there are many of them. We've seen them come and go over multiple cycles. In general, I would say they tend to
have fewer manual or labor-intensive processes. So, I'd be surprised if they did the extent of employment
verification we do.
And again, it might be appropriate if their average ticket is lower. They may have different return profiles. The one
thing I would say, the vast majority lend to a much broader spectrum than we do. And so, we focus on the prime
segment, again, primarily debt consolidation, but it is hard to generalize across the many different new entrants
that may have different models.
