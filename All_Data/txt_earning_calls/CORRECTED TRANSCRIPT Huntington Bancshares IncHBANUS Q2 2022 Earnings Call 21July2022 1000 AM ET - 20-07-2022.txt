Stephen D. Steinour
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Tim. Good morning and welcome. Thank you for joining the call today. Our outstanding second quarter
results reflect momentum across the bank as we completed the integration of TCF. While 2022 continues to bring
its own set of unique challenges, our businesses are performing very well. Overall, the companies in our markets
are in good shape and continue to evidence demand for loans to support business investment and expansion.
Consumers are generally maintaining liquidity. Much of the government and municipal stimulus funds are yet to
be invested. Importantly, Huntington and the banking industry remain very well positioned to withstand the current
volatility.
Now on to slide 4. First, our performance in the second quarter was exceptional, with record net income and
PPNR. Our focused execution is driving these robust results and leading returns. Loan growth continued in the
quarter, as we saw higher balances in nearly every portfolio across our commercial and consumer businesses.
Higher loan growth, paired with the benefit from higher interest rates, contributed to expanded net interest
income.
Second, we're pleased to deliver average deposit growth quarter-over-quarter in our commercial and consumer
businesses. The focus remains on growing primary bank relationships while maintaining a disciplined deposit
pricing strategy. Third, we achieved our target for core expenses below the $1 billion level, as we completed the
TCF cost synergy program. Fourth, we delivered on our medium-term financial goals this quarter earlier than

previously guided. Finally, we posted record low net charge-offs this quarter and overall credit quality remains
exceptional. This reflects our disciplined approach to customer selection and our aggregate moderate-to-low risk
appetite through the cycle. While we acknowledge the potential for uncertainty, to-date, we are not seeing
substantive areas of concern within our loan portfolios.
On slide 5, let me share more detail on our second quarter performance. Robust loan growth, higher net interest
income and expense reductions supported our record PPNR, which increased 17% from the prior quarter.
Average loan balances, excluding PPP, grew 10% on an annualized basis and are tracking to our expectations.
While growing deposits, we are maintaining deposit pricing discipline in the face of a rising rate environment. We
were also honored to be once again recognized by J.D. Power for the number one mobile app amongst regional
banks. This marks the fourth consecutive year earning the top rank.
Last month, we announced the formation of an enterprise-wide payments organization led by a dedicated
payments executive. This initiative reflects our strategic priority to accelerate our payments capabilities, expand
the services we provide to our customers, and drive additional fee revenues. In May, we announced the
acquisition of Torana, now known as Huntington Choice Pay, which is a payment business focused on providing
business to consumer payment services.
On the commercial side, we continue to see traction in our treasury management initiatives with revenues growing
12% annualized this quarter. On the consumer side, we launched an enhanced Cashback Credit Card offering
late in the first quarter, and results so far have exceeded our expectations. We are driving organic growth
opportunities by providing enhanced product offerings to the TCF customer base and growing share of wallet.
We completed the acquisition of Capstone last month, which adds a top-tier middle market investment bank and
advisory firm, bolstering our capital markets capabilities. We're pleased with the early contribution from our new
colleagues who added $4 million of capital market fees in the last two weeks of the quarter post-closing. Looking
forward, we see significant revenue synergies within our customer base as well.
Turning to slide 6, we extended our track record of modeled credit outperformance in the recent CCAR stress test
results. This year's process included the acquired TCF loan portfolios, and the results did not materially change
our modeled performance relative to peers. This highlighted the robust credit strength of Huntington's balance
sheet, which has continued to outperform peer median benchmarks in every CCAR cycle since 2015.
Finally, I want to highlight the accomplishments of the TCF combination. It's been just over a year since we closed
on the acquisition, and since then, we've delivered on the commitments we shared at announcement. We closed
quickly in under six months and converted systems just four months later. We delivered the cost synergies earlier
than guided. The pace of digital investment spend has doubled from the prior run rate, accelerating our digital
initiatives. We've delivered leading financial performance, which is evident in our results this quarter.
Finally, we are capturing incremental opportunities from the addition of key markets and capabilities through our
revenue synergy initiatives. Over the past year, we've added over 50 revenue producing colleagues in Minnesota
and Colorado to support wealth management, business banking, middle market, and specialty banking. The
middle market teams in the Twin Cities and Denver are growing relationships, increasing loans and deposit
production. We're also seeing increased productivity from the acquired branches and a positive reception to the
Huntington product offerings and customer service experience.
Our business banking expansion at Twin Cities and Denver is also showing substantial momentum, where we are
pleased to have already achieved the top five ranking for SBA lending in both markets. We've seen early traction

from our wealth management launch in the Twin Cities with AUM building year-to-date. As a result of this
success, we've replicated that approach in Denver and we've hired an experienced leader and other new
colleagues to build out our capabilities.
As for our inventory and equipment finance businesses, the teams continue to capitalize on the opportunities to
harness the combined scale to better serve our clients. Today, we're the seventh largest bank-owned national
platform, and I expect that ranking to increase based on the momentum we are experiencing. These initiatives are
ongoing and we expect them to contribute to our growth over multiple years. We are well-positioned to grow
shareholder value.
Zach, over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance.

Zachary J. Wasserman
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Slide 8 provides highlights of our second quarter results. We
reported earnings per common share of $0.35. Adjusted for notable items, earnings per common share were
$0.36. Return on tangible common equity, or ROTCE, came in at 19.9% for the quarter. Adjusted for notable
items, ROTCE was 20.6%. We were pleased to see sustained momentum in our loan balances with total loans
increasing by $2.8 billion, and excluding PPP, loans increased by $3.3 billion.
Total average deposits also increased, with growth in both consumer and commercial balances. Pre-provision net
revenue expanded sequentially and grew 17% from last quarter. Consistent with our plan, we reduced core
expenses below our target of $1 billion, driven by the realization of cost synergies. Credit quality was exceptional,
with record low net charge-offs of 3 basis points and nonperforming assets reduced to 59 basis points.
Slide 9 shows our continued trajectory of PPNR expansion. We see 2022 coming together quite well, as we drive
sustainable profitability and highlight the earnings power of the company, supported by our organic growth
initiatives and harnessing the benefits from the TCF acquisition. We remain committed to our long track record of
managing to positive operating leverage with disciplined expense management even as we continue to invest in
the business.
Turning to slide 10, average loan balances increased 2.5% quarter-over-quarter, totaling $113.9 billion. Excluding
PPP, total loan balance has increased $3.3 billion or 3%, driven by commercial and consumer loans. Within
commercial, excluding PPP, average loans increased by $2 billion or 3.3% from the prior quarter. These results
were supported by broad-based demand across commercial lending that is driving robust new production.
Line utilization remained relatively stable during the quarter on a core C&I basis, while we saw higher balances
within our inventory finance business. Commercial growth was led by middle market, corporate and specialty
banking, which collectively increased by $746 million during the quarter. Asset finance contributed meaningfully,
with balances higher by $497 million. Inventory finance continues to rebuild toward a more normalized level, with
average balances up $383 million during the quarter. Commercial real estate balances also increased by $213
million. Auto dealer floor plan balances were relatively stable, increasing by $45 million, as supply chain
constraints continued to dampen inventory levels.
In consumer, growth was led by residential mortgage, which increased by $1 billion, driven by slower pre-pays
and higher mix of on-balance sheet loan production. We also saw steady growth in RV/marine and indirect auto.
Average home equity balances declined by $41 million. However, we were pleased to see end-of-period balance
growth, driven by robust new production of first-lien refinanced products.

Turning to slide 11, we delivered average deposit growth of $2.1 billion. Deposit growth was led by commercial,
with deposits up $2.1 billion; while consumer balances increased by $500 million from the prior quarter. This
growth reflects our initiatives to drive primary bank relationships and new customer acquisition across the bank.
We remain disciplined on deposit pricing with our total cost of deposits coming in at just 7 basis points for the
second quarter.
On slide 12, we reported another quarter of sequential expansion of both net interest income and NIM. Core net
interest income, excluding PPP and purchase accounting accretion, increased by $125 million or 11% to $1.244
billion. Consistent with our prior guidance, net interest margin increased driven by higher earning asset yields as a
result of our asset sensitivity position and lower Fed cash balances.
Slide 13 highlights Huntington's deposit pricing discipline. We have a long history of managing through cycles,
and we believe our deposit base today is even stronger than it was starting the last tightening cycle. For the
second quarter, we've seen little change to our average cost of deposits, given the timing of rapid Fed rate moves
occurring later in the quarter. That said, we are remaining dynamic in this environment. We are managing the
portfolio at a very granular and segmented level, client by client in many cases, to ensure pricing discipline and
growing the primary bank relationships to bring lower cost operational deposits.
Turning to slide 14, we are managing the balance sheet in order to position ourselves to benefit from higher
expected rates in the short term, while also being judicious on managing possible downside rate risks over the
longer term. We continued to execute on our hedging strategy during the second quarter and increased our
downside protection by executing a net $3.3 billion of receive‐fixed swaps. Our expectation is to continue to add
to this hedging program during the third quarter.
Additionally, we are managing the securities portfolio to both capture the benefit from higher rates over time, as
well as protect capital. We increased the proportion of securities and held to maturity during the quarter and are
reinvesting securities portfolio cash flows at rates well above portfolio yields.
Moving to slide 15, noninterest income was $485 million, up $41 million year-over-year and down $14 million from
last quarter. We saw record activity within our capital markets business during the quarter, which drove revenues
up $12 million from prior quarter. Additionally, we saw expansion in our cards and payments revenues and
deposit service charges.
Fee revenues were impacted this quarter by lower gain on sale from SBA loan sales, as we sold less balances in
the second quarter compared to the prior quarter. Recall, we restarted our normal SBA loan sales earlier this
year. And while loan production remains robust, this quarter's gain on sale is generally aligned to our go-forward
expectations.
Fees were also impacted by a decline in mortgage banking, as volumes continued to normalize from the
exceptionally strong levels seen last year and due to lower saleable spreads. While we are pleased with the sales
and client engagement traction in our wealth management business, we saw lower overall revenues as market-
based AUM changes outweighed continued momentum in net asset flows.
Moving on to slide 16, noninterest expense declined $35 million from the prior quarter. Excluding notable items,
core expenses declined by $13 million to $994 million, as we completed the cost savings from the acquisition and
achieved our targeted expense level. Our efficiency ratio, which is an outcome of our revenue drivers and

expense management activities, came in at 57% on a reported basis and adjusted for notable items, was 56% for
the quarter, in line with our medium-term target.
Slide 17 recaps our capital position. Common equity tier 1 ended the quarter at 9.1% and within our target
operating range of 9% to 10%. As we go forward, our capital priorities remain unchanged, with our first priority to
fund organic loan growth. Our expectation is that given the strong sustained levels of loan growth, buybacks will
be de minimis, if any, for the remainder of the year. With the robust return on equity we are generating, we expect
to be able to fund this organic growth and see capital ratios move higher over the balance of 2022.
Our tangible common equity ratio, or TCE, declined to 5.8% as a result of AOCI marks on the securities portfolio.
Recall, this is an accounting construct that temporarily reduces equity as value marks are taken and then
reverses over time. And this does not impact our regulatory capital ratios. Our TCE ratio, excluding the AOCI
impact, has been relatively stable near 7% level. Finally, our dividend yield remains number one in our peer group
at 5%.
On slide 18, credit quality continues to perform very well. As mentioned, net charge-offs were a record low of 3
basis points, benefiting from another quarter of net recoveries in commercial portfolios and continued stability in
consumer credit quality. Nonperforming assets declined from the previous quarter and have reduced each of the
last four quarters. We also saw lower criticized loans, which have improved both from the prior quarter and prior
year. Allowance for credit losses was flat at 1.87% of total loans, reflecting a conservative reserve posture given
the heighted economic uncertainty, even as our internal portfolio metrics show stability.
We are proud to report, on slide 19, that we have achieved our medium-term goals. Since sharing these targets,
we have been intently focused on executing on our commitments and managing dynamically through the
changing environment. We have been guiding that we [indiscernible] (00:18:06) reflect these goals for the second
half of 2022. We have now achieved these results one quarter ahead of schedule. This performance represents
the earnings power of the franchise.
The TCF acquisition bolstered many of these areas and allowed us to gain incremental scale and profitability, as
Steve mentioned earlier. And the incremental growth momentum is only just the beginning. As we stand today, we
believe our return on capital is compelling compared to our peer set and demonstrates the financial rigor with
which we operate that is focused on creating fundamental value for shareholders.
Finally, turning to slide 20, let me update our outlook. Our guidance assumes the consensus economic outlook
through 2022 and it incorporates the rate curve as of end of June. Our loan growth outlook remains unchanged.
[indiscernible] (00:19:03-00:19:08) as a result of our balance sheet growth and the rate curve outlook, we are
again revising guidance higher for net interest income. We now expect core net interest income on a dollar basis,
excluding PPP and purchase accounting accretion, to grow in the high-teens to low-20s percent range. In fee
income, we continue to expect growth between low- and mid-single digits for the fourth quarter on a year-over-
year basis. We are continuing to see encouraging trends in our payments, capital markets, and wealth and
advisory businesses.
As we shared previously, our guidance incorporates the normalization of mortgage banking revenues and the Fair
Play enhancements we are making over the course of the second half of the year. Note, our guidance fully
captures the expected benefits of our Capstone Partners and Torana acquisitions, which closed in the second
quarter.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
On expenses, we are pleased to have completed the cost savings program. We are balancing continued
momentum in the business and strong revenue growth with the uncertainty around the near-term macro outlook
and inflationary pressures that are affecting the economy. The strong revenue performance of the business will
drive a degree of associated compensation expenses in addition to targeted investments to support key growth
initiatives. Hence, our expectation is for core expenses, excluding Capstone Partners and Torana, to grow at a
modest level for the balance of 2022. Additionally, Capstone and Torana will add incremental expenses of
approximately $25 million beginning in the third quarter run rate. Finally, given our continued exceptional credit
performance, we're revising our full-year net charge-offs down to less than 15 basis points from approximately 20
basis points previously.
That concludes our opening remarks. Tim, let's open up the call for Q&A, please.

Want to see if you could maybe comment on your deposit growth expectation, how you're thinking about the
ability to grow deposits here and possibly the makeup of that growth. I know you didn't include that in your formal
guidance and maybe if you could just kind of help us think about how we should model the growth. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Absolutely. Thanks, John. This is Zach. I'll take that one. I think just maybe taking a step back, we're pleased to
see the deposits continue to expand in the second quarter, as we talked about in the prepared remarks. And we
guided that we had that expectation and we were pleased to see it come through and be delivered. The outlook
going forward continues to be for modest growth. Commercial growing faster. Consumer likely flat to down a bit
because the environment is clearly volatile with the rate moves we've seen as of late, but that's the traction we're
seeing. And so far, it's corroborated here just in the first few weeks of July. The focus we've got is really

deepening engagement with our clients, growing our core operating accounts certainly within the commercial
business, primary bank relationships broadly across the franchise, and really balancing that growth with pricing
over time clearly, but that's the growth you've got for now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Thanks. And then related to that, maybe can you just collaborate a bit on the deposit beta expectations in
terms of how they could trend in the back half [indiscernible] (00:23:30-00:23:36) your terminal beta, ultimately.
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yes. I'll take that one again as well. So, yes, thus far in the cycle, it's been pretty limited in terms of pricing
changes that we've seen come through. As we highlighted in the prepared remarks, average deposit costs for Q2
just 4 basis points higher than Q1, so very lowest. That represents less than 10% beta. With that being said,
clearly, the rate moves happened late in the quarter in May and then more in June. And given the forecast for
July, we do expect Q3 and Q4 to be higher. As we take a step back and just think about this cycle, it's clearly
changing, and there are factors that are driving beta to be higher than really the last rate hike in the cycle. We
started from a lower starting point. Asset growth continues to be pretty strong here across the industry. And these
multiple more than 25 basis point rate moves that are happening in quick succession are clearly factors for beta.
With that being said, we do continue to recognize the level of excess liquidity across the entire industry at this
point is quite high. And inflation itself tends to increase balances over time as that filters into wages and corporate
revenues.
Taking a step back, it's still very early in the cycle. Our posture is to be very, very disciplined and manage this with
a lot of rigor at a very detailed level, as we noted before, and with that primary bank focus. And I think everything
we're seeing thus far and the incremental forecasting that we do on a monthly basis continues to corroborate that
we're on the trend that we were expecting.

Hey, Betsy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Wanted to just get a sense on how you're thinking about the buyback resumption, what the parameters would be,
and what you're looking at to turn that back on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Well, thanks for the question. This is Zach. I can take that as well. As we've talked about in the prepared
remarks, for Q2, we didn't do any buybacks given the Capstone acquisition closing. And I think as we think about
the next several set of quarters, our capital priorities are really guided by our overall priority set is first and
foremost to fund organic growth. And given the strong ROE that we get on the organic loans we bring in, that's
our top priority. That's what we intended and are really pleased to be able to allocate the capital, even as we also
manage capital ratios upward here trending towards the year-end. It's a little too early to call what happens in
2023. And as we get closer, we'll have a better view of what the plan might be at that point. But I think you'll see
us take capital ratios up here sequentially and deploying to the loan growth for the foreseeable future.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then you talked a bit already about the credit and what's going on with the corporate side. Could you
give us a sense on the consumer book, what you're seeing? Is there any differentiation at all between either FICO
bands, income bands or whether or not you're a housing – you're a homeowner or a renter? Any dynamics there
would be helpful. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Hey Betsy. It's Rich. I can take that one. On the consumer side, what you see, as we talked about in some of the
previous calls, just a little bit of increasing in the delinquencies just in many respects because they've been
running at such artificially low levels given the deferral business – deferrals in 2020 and the stimulus in 2021. I
would say in general, though, those books are performing very well. We have maintained our FICO disciplines
across the board. And with increasing auto pricing and increasing home rates, we've also done a good job of
keeping the loan-to-values constant or coming down. So, we feel very good about where the consumer book is
positioned right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Betsy, this is Steve. We publish our auto lending every quarter. So, you see new lending. It's super prime. It just
hasn't deviated more than 5 or 10 points and has generally drifted upwards over the last 12 years. And we're
super prime on the home side as well. And then the RV/marine has an average just over 800 – like, an 810 FICO.
So, all of this is very low default frequency, default expectation, and it's all secured. So, we feel very good on the
consumer book as a whole.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
So, for Zach, somewhat of a theoretical question. So, if we look at the balance sheet, the loan-to-deposit ratio is
low, which is keeping deposit betas very low at the moment. You're hedging to stabilize loan yields. When we
think about incremental loan beta versus incremental deposit beta, this is for you and the industry, are we
basically setting up where as we look out to 2023, the full year NIM could be higher in 2023 just mechanically over
2022, but at some point we should expect your quarter-over-quarter NIM to start trending down through the year
as deposit betas ultimately catch up?

Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Well, first of all, thanks for serving me up a theoretical question. I love to take those. Appreciate you doing that.
Look, I think that our outlook and best forecast that I see is for continued NIM expansion over the next few
quarters. And if you sort of stretch the forecast out, if you use the forward yield curve as guidance, that continues
out into the middle part of 2023 then starts to stabilize. My forecast doesn't show contraction, anything material,
just more kind of bouncing along a flat line as we get kind of further out into time. Obviously, you noted in your
question and I quipped about it, it is a little theoretical as you start to forecast on forecast on forecast, you get a
little too far, but that's the expectation that we've got.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
No, that's not what I said. I think generally continue to be tracking around to the same level as the last cycle. I
think the beta sort of trends over time, and that was the point I was trying to make. Initially in the early stages of
the cycle, it's quite low, and that's certainly what we saw in the second quarter, less than 10% beta in the second
quarter. I think the beta will accelerate as the rate environment and cycle continues. But in totality, on a
cumulative basis, still seeing generally the same kind of trends and outlook as we have seen in the last cycle.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
In the last. Okay. Got it. Thanks. And then for Steve, so there's quite a bit of talk about companies onshoring
supply chains, right, back to the US. I'm curious what you're seeing on the ground, and I'm not really talking about
the Intel plant. But beyond that, is this something that you're starting to see or is this just really a talking point at
this point? Thanks.

Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Steve, it's occurring, it's been occurring. I think, if anything, what we're even seeing this year with China shutdown
episodically with COVID, it's just reinforcing. So, it's supply chain, near-shore or onshore. And we're getting some
of that benefit here in the Midwest and I suspect probably in the Southeast, Southwest as well. I think that's going
to continue. The supply chains have gotten better in some industries, but still in most are a problem. And that
level of investment required is reflected in our equipment finance results. We had a record second quarter and
expect to have a very strong second half. Usually, our second half is better than the first half. So, the teams are
seeing a lot of investment. Reshoring is certainly a meaningful portion of it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
The other thing I'll just – this is Zach. Let me just tack on. The other kind of secular phenomenon and I think it's
going to be a tailwind for the industry broadly and for commercial banking space. The investment in property,
plant, equipment to deal with labor supply constraints, which are not going away anytime soon and are really
driving significant corporate level investments in automation, technology and things of that nature.

Hey, good morning, guys. Noticing the strong loan growth this quarter overall and keeping the guide for the year,
as I flip through the slide deck, I notice that the originations on some of the consumer buckets are understandably
smaller than they had been. I just want to ask you to flesh out again, as you think forward about commercial

growth versus consumer growth, are there any changes you guys are making in either underwriting criteria or
what you want to put on the books and how do you expect commercial versus consumer growth to look going
forward overall. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Sure. This is Zach, I'll take that one and see if my colleagues want to tack on throughout the course of answering
your question. Generally, as I noted and you noted in your question, continue to expect high-single-digit loan
growth by Q4. We're actually running above that level right now. Q2 was about a 10% annualized [indiscernible]
(00:33:56) which gives us the opportunity to optimize our capital allocation and really dial in the long-term return
of the asset growth as we go throughout the balance of this year, which we feel really good about to be in that
position.
The nature of the growth going forward would be pretty similar to what we've seen in the first half of this year, that
is commercial-led, driven by production and consumer growing but slower. And I think it's corroborated by what
we're seeing in the – particularly in commercial loan pipelines up – I don't think we mentioned – up 9% quarter-
over-quarter, 33% year-over-year in our late stage commercial pipeline. So, notwithstanding the economic
headlines, our clients are still investing, there's still opportunity to grow.
On the consumer side, we're going to see slower growth in residential mortgage than we saw in the first half as
we go into the second half, and auto and RV/marine should continue to contribute, although at a slower level. So I
think perhaps a modest shift toward commercial, but generally pretty similar to the nature of the growth we saw in
the first half.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Ken, I'll just tack on a little bit. With mortgage rates up, refi volumes down, you're seeing the mortgage numbers
everywhere. So, some of the home lending, at least on the mortgage side, will abate, maybe partially offset with
[ph] HELOC (00:35:23). But the consumer side, I think, will tend to be a little less robust than it has been. At the
same time, the sheer scale of the opportunities we have in these national businesses with TCF are really
extraordinary. So, the inventory finances is like number two to one of the big four nationally and that just has great
upside for us as supply chains get worked out. We talked before about auto floorplan, that's almost a $2 billion
number for us as it normalizes.
So, there's opportunity a bit in the utilization rate changes, we saw a little bit of that in the second quarter. There's
a lot of opportunity in utilization rate changes. But the growth dynamics here in these national businesses or new
markets are very, very good. We've got over 50 new business colleagues in Minnesota and Colorado, as I
mentioned earlier. And that activity is bearing fruit and will continue to be a source of growth for us as well. So,
very well-positioned. Zach gave you the closed-in pipeline as of contemporary week, but the total commercial
pipeline is almost double what it was a year ago. So, a lot of opportunities in front of us.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Got it. Great. Thank you, Steve. And then just one more follow – just drill down into auto. Just some peers – and
this isn't new. Some peers are saying that things are getting tougher on spreads and have pulled the way. You
guys tend to get that premium to the market. And just with the changing dynamics going on in terms of residual
values and new versus used mix, can you just talk about some of the dynamics there in terms of the ability to

continue to produce and originate at the same level and how you're expecting credit to act as well underneath?
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Well, the credit, we think, will have a very consistent performance because we've been so disciplined for more
than a decade. So, we don't expect to see any significant credit issues emerging out of auto or RV/marine, for that
matter, because that's an 810 plus average FICO. So, very, very low default frequencies. And that drives more
than valuation – used car valuation or other equivalent metrics much more to our business line than it has to most
because, frankly, we just don't have that many repossessions. As we think about the business going forward,
there's always a lag as rates rise in terms of getting pricing at a typical level, and there's always a benefit as rates
fall. So, we're dynamically pricing. Actually we don't focus on market share. It's about return and risk, and we'll
continue to do that. But we've been in this business for almost three-quarters of century. It's performed very, very
well for us and we expect it will continue to do so.
Thanks for your question, Ken. Next question?

Ebrahim Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Good. Hey, Zach. Just wanted to follow up on your expense guide. Two-part question. One, as we think about
your strategic target 56% efficiency ratio, just talk to us in terms of areas of investments as we look forward from
here and where you're flexing expenses in terms of savings and whether there is a case to be made that the
efficiency ratio normalize for whatever rate backdrop could be structurally lower than your current target.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks for the questions. There's a lot to unpack in expenses so I'm glad you gave me the opportunity to
do that. I think now that we have delivered the cost synergies fully, it's in the run rate, we're back to managing
expenses on an ongoing basis as the business grows and with the goal toward continuing to drive positive
operating leverage and modulating expenses relative to revenue.
While we self-fund the key investments in our strategic initiatives to sustain them and those are not changed from
what we've had before, we'll continue to do it to build out key commercial capabilities, build our critical fee
businesses and payments, capital markets, wealth, and I think continue to build terrific digital and overall product
capabilities within our consumer and business banking functions. So, those are the priorities. We'll keep investing
in them, aligned with clearly what Steve was just mentioning in terms of the terrific momentum we have in the
TCF expansion opportunities.

The efficiency ratio is an outcome, frankly. And our goal is really in the end to drive PPNR and just continue to
expand profitability over time. With that being said, I do think efficiency ratio could very well trend lower here just
given where the rate environment is going, and we'll see where that goes.

Ebrahim Poonawala Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. And I guess just a separate question on – in your slide deck, slide 35, you talk about digital engagement or
originations, both consumer, commercial deposit origination seem to have peaked a few quarters ago and
declined. Just wondering if anything to read in there and talk to us in terms of the investments you're making on
the digital side from a client on-boarding, acquisition perspective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. So, I think in terms of the investments we're making in digital should continue, and it's all about channel
development, internal process efficiency. And we've got – as we have had in the past, a series of interesting new
product developments that are on our roadmap that I – I won't steal the thunder on now, but you'll see them come
through into the market over time as we launch them.
We're always throttling the dials of where we're directing our marketing funding. And that changes the mix of
online versus offline account acquisition over time. But in the end, it's all about driving the most value ultimately
from the accounts in terms of depth of relationship and ultimately, customer lifetime value, and we feel really good
where that is trending, frankly.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Do you feel like there's an upper limit on your margin? I've covered your company for a long time and I always
think like 350-ish gets a little bit toppy on your margin. But is it possible to see similar types of sequential jumps in
the margin if we get another 75 basis points next week, or is there something in your business mix that would
prevent that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
If you see the room here, we're seeing a lot of heads nodding and pleasured with your question, so thanks for
asking it. I mean, I think, look, the reality is that there is no top. It's a function of where the interest rate
environment goes, right? And I think it could go higher. With that being said, I think, realistically, what you're
saying kind of a realistic range is right for the foreseeable future. And certainly, as we do our modeling based on
the yield curve where it is right now, we see continued expansion, as I mentioned in one of the questions earlier,
for the next few quarters and then beginning to flatten out as you get into kind of the middle part of 2023 and
beyond, again, based on the trajectory of the yield curve right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And then, Steve, a question for you. Acquisition appetite, it's probably an annoying question, but you've
done some fee businesses, and I think you've done well with those, you've done well with TCF. You did fine with
FirstMerit. Any interest at all in depositories, or is that just off the table, given the regulatory environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
We have a lot of opportunity to achieve with TCF. So, our expectation is just to continue to focus on that. And if
there is some ancillary fee businesses that help us in payments or wealth or capital markets, those would be of
interest to us. But we've got a lot of upside going forward over the next couple of years. And I don't know how to
think about the regulatory environment for us. We got approved in record time the last time with TCF, and we had
the same experience with FirstMerit and that should be some indication of our standing. And DFAST would be yet
another indication of the outperformance every time above median is a reflection of the quality of the portfolio. So,
we're seeing outstanding and have been. So, all of that suggests we're able to do things if we choose to, but our
focus will continue to be drive the revenue opportunity from the TCF combination.

The expected pre-pandemic day-one CECL reserve was much lower, much lower for legacy Huntington and even
much lower for TCF than legacy Huntington given its shorter duration loan portfolio than your current reserve
level. So, with the economic forecast at very healthy levels here, just want to see why maybe your reserve today
is higher than where it was pre-pandemic.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard A. Pohle A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
The pre-pandemic, I mean, I think you have to go back. I mean, that's over two years ago. So, it's a point in time.
This is always a point in time. The portfolio has – mix has shifted over times as well. We had a big oil and gas
portfolio that was part of CECL day one that's not here anymore. We've got more real estate today than we had
back then. So, a lot of it is a function of just the makeup of the portfolio. And as we're sitting here today, we're
looking potentially in a recession where I think if you went back to January of 2020, you didn't have that on the
horizon potentially near term. So, it's a combination of everything. The mechanics of CECL, you look at it every
quarter and you run your models and you make subjective adjustments where do you think the models might be,
not capturing everything. And as we sit here at the end of the second quarter, we had come down for six
consecutive quarters prior to this one, and just thought it was time to take a little bit of a pause and see where
things shake out. So, it's a quarter-by-quarter analysis we do. And it's really hard to go back to CECL day one and
say this is a goal or an objective to get there.

can be created?

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 21-Jul-2022
Well, we haven't given guidance along those lines, David, but you're hearing us allude to it in terms of equipment
finance, inventory finance. The reference – as stated, TCF didn't do SBA lending in Colorado or Minnesota. In
fact, they didn't do C&I lending or small business lending in Colorado. So, you get a lot of – or for that matter,
wealth in either market. So, there's a lot of investment that has been made that early on is producing, and I think
just gets bigger and better as we scale those businesses in those markets.
And then, we are a force in Michigan. We were having great growth in Michigan. And we're now able to run a full
set of plays in Chicago. So, you have those combinations of regional markets, our equipment finance, number
seven nationally. I think we'll be better than that on a relative position by the end of the year based on the
volumes we see. So, we've got a lot of synergy that's been achieved.
And we've been emphasizing OCR. We have a much better product set on both the consumer and commercial
side, and that emphasis will continue to translate into revenue growth in capital markets, card and other
businesses, fee businesses for us, treasury management, et cetera, as we go forward. We'll give some thought to
trying to mention that over time for you and others, but at this point, we haven't done so.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. Just had a follow-up question on how yields – the yield trajectory. Zach, the increase in AFS
yields was particularly eye-popping. Was that just a function of the starting point of [ph] 1.65% (00:50:25) is just
so low, or was there anything sort of more one-time in nature there? And additionally, I noticed that C&I yields
were only up 5 bps in the quarter. And I'm wondering if you expect that loan beta to accelerate over the next few
quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. Nothing unusual in the first category you talked about. I think we're just seeing that continued trend through
and certainly in our securities portfolio broadly really benefiting from expanding yields and just the reinvestment of
the cash flows. Overall, broadly speaking across the loan categories, we're seeing nice trends in new money yield
with gross yields really benefiting as the yield curve is expanding here. Environment is still competitive. And so,
it's still a factor, but we're seeing new money rates expand in almost every major product line across the board,
around 30 bps to give you a sense overall from Q1 to Q2.
And, yeah, I think that the average rate increase in Q2 versus Q1 was relatively modest. I think we're going to see
coming through – related to your C&I question in Q3, is more just given, again, the timing of the rate moves – and
the moves and so for late in the quarter versus what we'll see on average for Q3.

Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And just a follow-up question. Clearly, the market has priced in – started to price in a mild downturn
– some sort of downturn over the near term. Could you remind us when you printed an ACL ratio of 2.22% in
2020, what kind of unemployment rate were you assuming then? And if we think about a mild downturn over the
next 6 to 12 months, how much more will your ACL ratio climb from what seems to already be a pretty nice level
of 1.87%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, as it relates to where we were a couple of years ago, I'd have to go back and take that out. I would
just say that we use multiple scenarios and each one is going to have embedded assumptions around GDP and
unemployment. And those are going to run a pretty wide range, but it's the mix, the weighted average of all those
that we could track down.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
And this is Zach, I'll just tack on. I would not draw sort of a direct correlation in that way. I think it – there's just too
many other factors that go into it. And I think that it's not even necessarily the case that it would go up. I think it
really depends on, I think, what the trajectory is and what the outlook is across the various scenarios also –
clearly the depth and duration of any economic softening is the most important factor.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen D. Steinour A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Well – and I think the other thing that you have to look at is the – with CECL, it's really hard to predict where the
actual level of reserves is going to go because not only is that a function of the portfolio, but it's also a function of
loan growth. So, you've got to build that in. So, this quarter, we kept the ACL coverage flat, but the dollars
[indiscernible] (00:54:00) because of the loan growth we experienced. So, there's a few moving pieces in there.
But I would say, entering into a potential downturn with a position of strength, we would think would mitigate any
large increases going forward.

Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
...disclosures you offered previously on that one in particular were based on prior year's performance. So, just any
updated thoughts now that they're officially under the umbrella?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Yeah. So, thanks for the question, Scott. And just, we couldn't be more pleased about closing both of those
acquisitions. Torana is relatively small. Capstone is a very scaled business as we've talked about, and just what
an amazing fit for our capital markets business and not only bring on a great run rate, but the opportunity to
expand that business within the Huntington franchise is really, really significant. So, we're thrilled about it. At this
point, our current forecasts are around that same kind of run rate here over the next couple of quarters. And I
think we'll – we'll see the synergies start to manifest as we get out further into time, but really excited about that. I
think Torana over time will grow, a relatively small impact in this year.

So, Scott, I think Zach gave you like a $100 million three-year average revenue.

Zachary J. Wasserman A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Huntington Bancshares, Inc.
Correct.
