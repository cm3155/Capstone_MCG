Mariner Kemper
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Thank you, Kay, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us as we discuss our third quarter results
announced yesterday afternoon. We had another solid quarter, with strong fee business performance and near
double-digit annualized loan growth, driven by record top line loan production of $1.4 billion. Our line utilization
has remained steady at 37% to 39% over the past several quarters, and our loan pipeline remains strong heading
into the fourth quarter. Overall, we're pleased with the strength of both sides of our balance sheet, as well as the
robust tractions in many of our fee income businesses. We reported GAAP earnings of $109.6 million or $2.23 per
share, driven by continued momentum across our various lines of business. On an operating basis, we earned
$2.25 per share.
The increase in interest income was driven primarily by continued loan growth and higher levels of liquidity,
partially offset by changes in funding mix. The strength of our diversified financial model was evident this quarter,
with strong fee income growth from several areas, including within our institutional business, where assets under
administration exceeded $0.5 trillion. Trading and investment banking volumes increased largely in municipal and
mortgage-backed securities, driving a 30% linked quarter increase in fee income. In corporate trust, higher off
balance sheet money market balances contributed to stronger 12b-1 fees in the quarter.
And our private wealth teams have brought in $1 billion in net new assets year-to-date or 33% ahead of full-year
2023 levels. We focus on operating leverage rather than specific expense growth target. So, compared to the
third quarter a year ago, we posted positive operating leverage of 4.4% on an operating basis. Ram will provide
more detail on income and expense drivers shortly.
Balance sheet growth included a 9.8% linked quarter annualized increase in average loan balances, in contrast to
many of our peers' comments on anemic loan growth and slowing utilization. In fact, for banks reported so far, the
median annualized increase in average loan balances has been just 3.4%. Loan growth was led by commercial
real estate, with multi-family balances posting 13% linked quarter growth and by construction draws on previously
approved lines. We also saw a solid C&I activity with some increased M&A activity among our clients. Credit
quality in our loan portfolio remains excellent and a hallmark of our business, as evidenced by just 8 basis points
of net charge-offs on a year-to-date basis and non-performing loans of just 8 basis points of total loans.
Over the past eight quarters, our non-performing ratio has averaged just 8 basis points compared to 39 basis
points for our peer group and 35 basis points for the industry as a whole. C&I continues to perform well with just 3
basis points of net charge-off for the quarter and net recoveries three out of the last four quarters. Credit card is
typically the largest component of our net charge-offs, and that was the case again in the third quarter. We have
heard some consumer-heavy lenders discuss borrowers at risk and several anecdotal comments from retail
participants in the retail sector seeming to support that sentiment.
For UMB, however, consumer credit card represents just 1% of average total loan balances and typically makes
up approximately 5% to 7% of credit card purchase volume. Most of our credit card net charge-offs for the quarter
stemmed from our recent portfolio acquisition, which had a different credit profile than we normally underwrite. For
context, these acquired balances averaged $118 million for the third quarter. On the flip side, relative to our
original expectation, the portfolio yields on these acquired balances have also outperformed. Excluding losses on
credit cards, our net charge-off rate this quarter would have been only 2 basis points.

The higher provision expense in the quarter largely reflects the impact of loan growth, along with some general
portfolio trends. Our coverage ratio increased to 1% of total loans. Average total deposits grew $951 million or
11.1% on a linked quarter annualized basis, including the intentional reduction of brokered CD balances. For
comparison, banks that have reported third quarter results so far had a median annualized growth in deposits of
just 4.9%. While commercial DDA balances increased 11% on an annualized basis, overall average DDA
balances declined, largely driven by tax payments and other activity in asset servicing and corporate trust. As
we've discussed in the past, these cash distributions by our large institutional clients can be episodic in nature,
and there is some seasonality in the balances, especially among municipal and corporate trust [indiscernible]
(00:21:35).
Finally, we're on track to complete our pending acquisition of Heartland Financial, subject to approvals and have
updated milestones and progress on the integration planning in the deck. Our integration teams are collaborating
well as they scale up, and we are well on our way with preparations for legal deadline still anticipated for some
time in the first quarter. Again, we believe this transaction will accelerate UMB's growth strategy further
diversifying and derisking our business model. The addition of this high-quality franchise is a great fit from a
strategic, financial, and cultural perspective. And we look forward to serving our prospective clients and
geographies as well as welcoming new associates to UMB.
Now, I'll turn it over to Ram.

Thanks, Mariner. Net interest income of $247 million represented an increase of $2.3 million or just under 1%,
reflecting continued loan growth and higher levels of liquidity, partially offset by the higher cost related to a
funding mix shift. The mix shift was driven both by a $1.6 billion increase in average interest-bearing deposit
balances, as well as the $601 million decrease in DDA, which impacted net interest margin by 5 basis points. As
we noted, our DDA balances can fluctuate based on the activity of our institutional clients, which may include tax
and bond payments as part of being the trustee or funds that were deployed in the market in the asset servicing
business.
Additionally, as Mariner noted, activity from our corporate trust and specialty trust clients can be lumpy and
episodic in nature. As a result, our DDA balances were at the lower end of the $9.5 billion to $10 billion range
we've seen in recent quarters and generally represent the low point of the year from a seasonality perspective.
Average interest-bearing liabilities increased 4%, with increases in interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a
decrease of $280 million in borrowed funds. As noted on slide 34 of the deck, we further reduced borrowing levels
following quarter-end, paying off $800 million in BTFP prior to its contractual maturity in January 2025. While the
BTFP balances contributed $1.1 million in net interest income in the third quarter, it was almost 4 basis points
dilutive to net interest margin. Additionally, the $250 million in both FHLB advances and brokered CDs matured
earlier in October, which should also benefit margin going forward.
Net interest margin for the third quarter decreased 5 basis points sequentially to 2.46%, largely due to the decline
in average DDA balances. As you can see from our yield tables, net interest spread was unchanged from the
linked quarter as the benefit of free funds declined 5 basis points and impacted margin.
Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect net interest margin to improve a few basis points from the third quarter,
driven by wholesale funding maturities I noted earlier, as well as the catchup of repricing actions on indexed
deposits from the mid-September rate cut. This may be partially offset by delayed loan repricing on loans tied to
4

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024
SOFR and Prime, as well as the impacts of continued contraction in one-month SOFR rates in advance of
anticipated rate cuts in November and December. As you are aware, the one-month SOFR rate has declined 20
basis points through last week in advance of the expected 25 basis point cut on November 7.
I will add my usual caveat that the trajectory of our margin will depend on the timing and pace of interest rate cuts,
levels of activity primarily in our institutional businesses that can impact the mix of our liabilities, and the overall
pricing environment for loans and deposits. As an additional reminder, approximately 35% of our total deposits
are hard indexed to short-term interest rates. As the Fed funds rate changes, these deposits reprice down
immediately. An additional 18% of our deposits are soft indexed, balances negotiated at current prevailing market
rates. On these soft-indexed deposits, we will generally move rates down pretty quickly following Fed cuts.
Overall, we continue to expect our deposit betas on the way down to be steeper than peer banks, similar to our
experience during the tightening cycle. We estimate that for the 50 basis point rate cut that happened in
September we were able to garner close to 90% betas on our indexed deposits. While the cost of interest-bearing
deposits increased quarter-over-quarter due to new institutional deposit growth, the cost of rate-bearing deposits
in September declined 8 basis points from August compared to a 10 basis point decline in loan yields.
Our interest rate simulation results on page 33 of our deck show us benefiting from interest rate cuts in year one
with a more modest benefit for year two. Our projections now show up slightly liability sensitive based on a static
balance sheet as of September 30 and current market assumptions for interest rates and prepayments. As a
reminder, this analysis does not include any interest income generated from new growth or the HTLF acquisition.
At this preliminary stage, we estimate that our pro forma interest rate position will remain relatively neutral.
On the right side of page 33, we've added more detail on loan repricing, including timing of rate adjustments for
both SOFR and Prime indexed loans. The timing of movements in SOFR rates in advance of the FOMC action
had an immaterial impact to the third quarter given the mid-September timing. As the FOMC meets and act
sooner in the quarter, it is likely that SOFR also moves ahead of anticipated Fed actions, resulting in some timing
differences between when loans and indexed deposits reprice. We've also added details on slide 33 about the
hedges we have in place. Currently, we have $2.5 billion notional value in [indiscernible] (00:27:33) cash flow
hedges, which include three floor contracts and eight floor spreads.
Details and activity in our securities portfolio are shown on slide 30 and 31 in our deck. The combined AFS and
HTM portfolios averaged $12.3 billion during the quarter, relatively flat from the prior quarter levels. Security levels
fluctuate based on our collateral needs for both public funds and trust businesses. The average purchase yield in
our portfolio was 4.64% for the third quarter, while securities rolling off at a yield of 3.18%. We expect $1.5 billion
of securities with an average yield of 2.62% to roll off over the next 12 months. Pricing on new investments in
September averaged 4.2% and are subject to change depending on what happens in the middle part of the
Treasury curve.
Capital levels continue to build with our common equity Tier 1 ratio increasing 8 basis points to 11.22%. As
announced yesterday, the board of directors declared a 2.6% increase in the quarterly dividend rate to $0.40 per
share, payable in January 2025. We've seen continued growth in tangible book value per share, which increased
$6.28 from June 30 to $66.86. Tangible book value per share has grown more than 28% over the past year. As a
reminder, our capital levels do not include the $230 million forward equity offering agreement that we announced
in April.
Turning back to the income statement, non-interest income was $158.7 million, a linked quarter increase of 9.5%.
Aside from the impact of market-related variances, which include security valuation changes and COLI income,
5

the largest driver of fee income was trust and securities processing, where the strong fund services and corporate
trust activity, Mariner mentioned, is captured. This income line has seen steady increases in recent quarters.
Other drivers of the linked quarter increase were $1.7 million of additional income from both investment banking
and brokerage income and $1.1 million gain on the sale of a building, partially offset by lower healthcare-related
deposit service charges.
Non-interest expense of $252.5 million for the quarter included pre-tax acquisition expenses of $2.6 million and an
additional reduction of $1.7 million in previously accrued FDIC assessment charges. On an operating basis, non-
interest expense increased $8.3 million in linked quarter and included a $1.3 million increase in variable bonus
and commission expense, as strong performance in several of the businesses resulted in higher incentive
accruals. Salary and benefits expense was also impacted by one more salary day in the third quarter. We
purchased additional laptops and computer equipment during the quarter, driving an increase of $1.6 million in
supply costs. The $1.9 million increase in deferred compensation expense is the offset related to the higher COLI
income.
Finally, our effective tax rate was 19.2% for the quarter, compared to 19% in the third quarter of 2023. On a year-
to-date basis, the increase in tax rate was primarily related to lower income on tax exempt securities and higher
non-deductible acquisition costs in 2024. For the full-year 2024, we would expect the tax rate to range between
18% and 20%. Looking ahead to 2025, our preliminary estimate, including the HTLF acquisition, is an effective
tax rate of 21% to 23%.
Now, I'll turn it over to the operator for the Q&A session.

Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
I was curious if you could talk through the pricing and deposits a little bit more. I know Ram you gave quite a bit of
detail on negotiated versus index and all that. So, with the 50 basis point cut late in 3Q as we kind of roll through
4Q, I was curious, if you can shed some light on any anecdotal or data in terms of pricing that you're seeing as
we've kind of flipped in the 4Q here in pricing trends or defaults and then also the mix itself. Any commentary
would be really helpful.

Mariner Kemper A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Can you take that, Ram?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah, sure. As I said on the prepared comments that still about 35% of our deposits are what we call hard
indexed, right? So, those are very formulaic based on what a Fed effective rate might be. So, those are not
immediately. And then, there's another 18% that are negotiated rates or what we call soft indexed rate. So, if you
look at our total deposit pie, 53% between those two have prevailing market rates upwards of 4% today that we –
as I said in my prepared remarks, we got anecdotally close to 90% beta on those – on the first 50 basis points cut.
But the remaining 30% is DDAs and then there is a back book call it 25% that on a lower rate. So, that kind of
gives you a timeframe or a framework for what might happen to deposit costs. Again, these are all based on what
happens to short-term interest rates and they happen within hours, days of when the Fed might build their rates.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
And Ben, I might add also, third quarter is a low point for DDAs related to seasonality for us. So, there's probably
likely a DDA build in the fourth quarter that was not there in the third quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got you. No, that's helpful. Let me ask it differently. So, when you lower something, obviously there's a negotiated
component to it. But are you seeing any pushback on anything or are you, let's say, [indiscernible] (00:33:52)? As
clients see the price or their yield on deposits move lower index, I totally get is contractual and there's the
negotiated aspect. Are you seeing pushback in anything, even though it's 50 bps or not?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
There is no push back on the index. There's very little pushback on the soft indexed, and then the back book
works the way we work anywhere. But there's an expectation from the client that rates are dropping. We don't
have any real sense that that's a challenge, haven't heard anything.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got you. Okay, that's helpful. And then, if I could ask a question about fee income. It seems like everything was all
systems go, like all silos or all the horses seem to be pulling in the same direction for this quarter. I know you
highlighted a couple of non-core items in the prepared remarks. When you think about the sustainability going into
2025, do you exclude kind of the couple of one-time items you called out, Ram? Is this a fair starting off point is
like a base or would you say this is a little bit overheated to some extent on the numbers?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. I wouldn't call it overheated, Ben. As you had rightly summarized, all systems and all our fee income
businesses have been performing well. We had a lot of off balance sheet deposit growth that gave us additional
12b-1 fees and our off balance sheet deposits are at $16 billion and growing. Our fund services, as I said in my
7

prepared remarks, has been on all cylinders for the last few quarters. Alternative investments, brokerage income
– our trading investment banking income was another strong quarter because we are seeing a lot of demand for
municipal and mortgage-backed securities both on the bank and non-bank qualified side.
So, the only non-core quarter-to-quarter [audio gap] (00:35:43) is the $1.1 million on the gain on the sale of a
building, and then periodically we have COLI, which have an equal offset on the deferred comp side. And then,
the last one is mark-to-market on equity holdings. That happens all the quarter. So, we feel pretty good about our
fee income trajectory and probably the businesses are doing. Card services is another one where we've seen
interchange income grow. You can see the purchase volume on one of our slides is growing pretty well still, so
feel pretty good entering into 2025.

Mariner Kemper A

Yeah. Excess liquidity, yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yeah. And then, when we look at the DDA accounts average versus end of period, there's obviously a lot of
variability there. But how should we be thinking about sort of the trending of that average DDA balance over the
next few quarters?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. I would focus only on the average, just as we always say, our period end balances can be higher, $3
million, $4 million, $5 million, name it. DDAs, I go back to what I said in my prepared comments in the recent
quarters we've seen the range between $9.5 billion and $10 billion. And as Mariner just said, third quarter tends to
be our seasonally lowest quarter and was closer to the $9.5 billion between just – organic buildup between our
institutional and commercial clients and then on the interest-bearing side, we also see late in the fourth quarter
inflow of public funds that's about $800 million typically on a net typical season that we get in weighted towards
December. So, we feel pretty good about our deposit pipeline for the fourth quarter, both on the DDA side and the
public fund side.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay, thanks. And then, looking on loan growth, you talked about you called out the sort of record production
levels in the lower utilization rates. Could we see double-digit organic growth on lending in 2025 if we get sort of a
normalization at all of utilization rates?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Well, we typically just give a 90-day look forward on loan growth. And so, we did that in the prepared remarks,
which is that fourth quarter looks strong like the third quarter and the previous quarters before that. Whether I
would say that we remain bullish on our prospects the same way that we've been growing businesses, the same
way we see growing business in 2025, which is market share gains and production activity based on individual
officer had capability capacity. Same way as we've always projected and seeing loan growth.
So, what I would say, to answer your question about 2025 is there are no impediments to growth that we see in
front of us sort of keep us from doing what we've been able to do historically. That doesn't mean the impediments
can't come along the way, but we expect to continue to perform.

Okay. Great, thanks. And just finally for me, just any update you can give us on expected accretion as part of NII
for 2025 for loans and securities, any sort of update or sharpening the pencil that is as you've gone through the
quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Jared, I don't have an update. We don't typically run rate market accretion. I mean, we obviously did it due
diligence and then the next opportunity will, it's pretty onerous process. So, the next opportunity for us will be at
close. But, generally, I mean, it really depends on the direction of rates on what happens to interest rate marks,
and we've seen some volatility in recent days really, right? But when you look back to the announcement day, the
rates have come down since then. So, all else being equal, that's a positive for what it means upfront in terms of
interest rate mark and capital. So – but I don't have exact numbers for you and we don't typically refresh that
analysis until close.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi, good morning. Good morning, guys. Maybe starting on the loan growth side and speaking to some of your
competitors in the market, it seems like the competition for growth has been intensifying. I'm just wondering what
you guys are seeing in terms of competition around structure, around rates. We heard that there may be some
looser terms around recourse, maybe what you're seeing from a competitive side and your ability to drive the type
of loan growth you've been getting.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I would say that nothing is new and nothing has ever been new. And from our vantage point, it's always very
competitive. And we play in a – an A space best of quality. So, it's always competitive and so nothing new. It's
always competitive, and we're just really good at winning it.

Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then, maybe just going back to some of the balance sheet moves this quarter, just looking at the
deposit side, it's seasonally weaker quarter for DDA that looks like the institutional client acquisition drove up
some of the higher cost this quarter. I guess, what is the end of period kind of transitory component that you
would call out? Do these two maybe balance each other out where DDA grows some of the institutional money
maybe rolls off? I guess, what would you classify as being transitory in the third quarter deposit growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
I mean, these are same clients that have excess balances at each month and quarter in very predictably. So, I
wouldn't call it anything non-core. They just have – we have an inflated balance at month-end and quarter-end
because of our clients and what they are doing their businesses.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. The activity of our larger clients are their transactions are very large and they're very episodic. So, you just
never know when they're going to happen. So, it's not transitory. It's just episodic. I would say that as...

some wholesale activity, kind of what's the starting point for an asset base in 4Q.

...we transitioning to assets, okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. The assets are driven by what's happening on the deposit side. So, as I said earlier, in a normal month-
end, quarter-end, we might have $3 billion at quarter-end that you see in the period-end balance sheet that leaves
within the first week following the end of the quarter. But then, it happens every quarter as clockwork. It's very
predictable. It's the same clients we have great visibility into those. So, again, we can talk all day about end of
period balances, but I would focus on what average balances do. That's more representative of what their
operating account with us is without some volatility or episodic nature.

line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Good morning, Nathan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I know you guys don't typically give guidance on NII, but Ram, just going back to the balance sheet comments
and just the expectations for the margin to be up a few basis points and just given what you have repricing in
terms of indexed deposits, is it fair to assume that NII or at least the pace of growth and NII should increase in 4Q
relative to 3Q?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Short answer, yes. The balance sheet growth that we saw in third quarter and the anticipated pipeline that
Mariner talked about for fourth quarter, coupled with what's going to happen on the repricing side on the indexed
deposits, if you recall, the last rate cut happened in mid-September, and we only have 15 days of activity on the
repricing of indexed deposits reflected in our third quarter numbers. So, that's why I gave you the September

versus August that was only 8 basis points out of the 50 basis points. So, yeah, I would answer in the affirmative.
And then, as I said, the BTFP was paid down, there might be lower liquidity balances, but those all had very
minimal impact on NII. So, yeah, I would say fourth quarter growth in NII at least should be more than what you
saw in the third quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
And the third quarter is a low point for deposit balances still, so.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it, makes sense. And just curious, as you're kind of budgeting for expenses next year, as you guys have
gotten more familiar with the team at HTLF, are you still feeling comfortable with the 27.5% cost save target and
getting 40% [indiscernible] (00:46:28) next year? Are you guys seeing maybe additional cost synergy
opportunities as that process is unfolded?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
We are not really refreshing our modeling at this point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, great.
[indiscernible] (00:46:45)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
...first question, we feel comfortable about the 27.5%.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, great. And then, just one clarifying question, Ram. On the 12b-1 fees, can you remind us in terms of the
magnitude of rate cuts that we would need to see for those to be impacted materially?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. This should take another 300, 350 basis points of rate cut before those money market waivers kick in. So,
we got some ways to go, if at all.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Plus, there's the growth. So, those businesses continue to grow, all of our institutional businesses continue to
grow, so the balances continue to grow. So, you've got that working against whatever that would happen when it
ever happens.

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got you. And I believe you guys touched on this earlier, but just specifically on the fund services and corporate
trust and institutional asset growth – I'm sorry, revenue growth, both of those lines are up low-double digits year-
over-year. Just curious if you think that pace of growth in those lines in particular is sustainable as you look into
2025?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. I'll take that quickly and if Jim has anything to add, he certainly can. I mean, the story continues to be the
same, pipelines are very good across all those businesses. We have a pole position in all the businesses on
corporate trust, we're number two in the country. Fund services, we're probably the primary alternative services
company in the country when there's a lot of M&A activity in that space led by private equity themselves and that
puts the other service providers that are involved in M&A in penalty box with the boardrooms.
So, it puts us kind of out front with the ability to book business and the pipeline just looks – continues to look the
same in that business, and we're really excited about the way that looks. And institutional custody is also a fast
growing part of our business, so we've broadened that business beyond just fund servicing. We have a big, strong
institutional custody business that's broking business outside of fund services. And so, that's – it's really just
coming across the board. And on top of the new business, we have some very successful big platform clients that
as they are successful, we are successful. So, our client base itself continues to grow and have great success in
fund services. So, [indiscernible] (00:49:14)...
[indiscernible] (00:49:16)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James D. Rine A
President & President & Chief Executive Officer-UMB Bank, UMB Financial Corp.
It's a great story. And the only thing I would add is you probably follow the announcement that we launched our
CLO trustee services and that at the end of the day, that really rounds out our offering as far as full-service
corporate trust shop. If we've upgraded, we added additional software investments, additional upgrades to the
services platform. So, Mariner said in the past that the business is really on fire and that holds true in the fourth
quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
The only thing I would add as we didn't – was in our comments, prepared comments we had talked about that
we're pretty excited. Our wealth business is on fire. So, we've put on $1 billion in new assets in the last quarter or
year-to-date rather, this year we're up $1 billion, which is more than we had done year-to-date last year. And so,
we're – that business is really positioned well. All the work that our team has been doing there to really sort of
gaining share is really paying off. So, we're really excited about our wealth business kind of going to the next level
also.

Operator: Our next question today is from the line of David Long with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your
line is now open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, everyone. On the deposit side of things, getting away from your indexed deposits, maybe looking
at new deposit rates, what are you looking at for pricing on new rates? And is the market rational – would you call
your competitors rational on deposit pricing following the 50 basis point cut?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Hey, Ram, [indiscernible] (00:51:13)...
[indiscernible] (00:51:20)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay, sorry about that. I don't know if it was my or not, but looking at deposit pricing, I wanted to ask about new
deposit and what type of yields you're seeing or rates you're offering on new deposits. And how are competitors
reacting? Are they being rational after the 50 basis point cut that the Fed made?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, we're – I think it's a rational market. I mean, it's nice because anything we're seeing is better than
what we were seeing. So, we're kind of gaining on the way down regardless. And – but as you do campaigns, you
do reach a little bit of campaigns. So, we've had some success on the retail front with campaigns, and we hope to
benefit from those over time as they mature [indiscernible] (00:52:14). But anything we're bringing on, we're
bringing on less than we were bringing on before. So, there's some marginal improvement along the way.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. And then, I'll add on the institutional side, it's always a calculus for us between what we can potentially
borrow at. So, when we priced this, we're always competing with money market funds, so our rates tend to be Fed
15

Q3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024
effective plus or minus, which is why we have the indexed deposit book that we have. So, I would say it's been
rational across all our lines of businesses, and we see periodic checks on the market for retail promotions and
then same thing with commercial.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
And on the commercial institutional side, there's so much volume and opportunity for us, it's really just being
disciplined about whether we can do better at the window than we can with what we're bringing on. So, there's so
much opportunity we're able to be disciplined about what we're bringing on, on the commercial and institutional
side. And on the retail side, we're just playing the same game everybody else is with just being out there and
trying to build new relationships and there's some marketing costs to that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Thank you. No, that's some very good color. I appreciate it. And then on the lending side, when you're
having conversations with your commercial customers, is there a level of rates, another 50 or 100 basis points of
cuts that you feel like increases your clients appetite to borrow and can maybe add another layer of loan growth
for UMB?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mariner Kemper A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, UMB Financial Corp.
I think that's yet to be seen, right? I mean, like we continue to say for us, we budget and forecast our loan growth
based on market share gains tied to how penetrated we are in any one market and what our capabilities and
capacities are and what our long-term customers are doing and what their pipelines look like.
As far as economic activity, if that gets stronger, I would say for us, certainly there can be some upside to that. I
think really the way to think about us when you think about the peer group is, we have for 20 years we've done
approximately 2x our peer group in loan growth regardless of what the economy is. So, I think the real way to
think about it is how we perform on a relative basis as not on an absolute basis. So, if things get better, I would
suggest that whatever we were going to do would be marginally better. But we still expect to outperform on a
relative basis the way we have for 20 years.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great morning. Ram, a question on the balance sheet. I mean, if I look at your earning assets and then I add in
Heartland's, you're just under $60 billion. I guess, as you go into to close, is there anything, I guess, on either
balance sheet that's kind of prime for restructuring exit optimization? I guess, I'm getting that like what's the right
earning asset base to be looking at as you close this deal early next year? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. No plans to restructure anything other than what we said at announcement. We're just going to swap out
some of their bonds for what we would hold on our balance sheet. So, other than that, I think the ballpark that you
quoted our $40 billion in earning assets and their $18 billion or so. We're talking about, yeah, $60 billion of
earning assets that should be in the ballpark before...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A

...any growth. Nothing new, nothing new.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q

Before growth.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Nothing new really. There's nothing new to report that we didn't already disclosed when we did the deal
[indiscernible] (00:56:17).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah, got it. And then, Ram, getting back to just the deposit betas away from the indexed, which is I think pretty –
you've been pretty transparent about the indexed pieces. I guess, what's the beta you're assuming either on the
rest of the book or the whole book maybe this quarter and then into next year, just trying to fine tune a little bit of
the assumptions?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ram Shankar A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, UMB Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, just to revisit, right, we're talking about 25% of our deposit book that's not indexed or DDA. So, on this
book, the prevailing rates on our balance sheet are about 2%. So, that's – we'll assume a 30% beta on those. Our
beta trajectory on the way down is going to be largely influenced by what's happening on the hard and soft index.
That's where the opportunity is, just like it was on the way up.

Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah, just had a quick follow-up. One question I've been getting from investors as it relates to the Heartland
acquisition, there's been a recent FDIC proposal around having to have public hearings when the bank exceeds
$50 billion in assets. So, it was wonder if you could just comment on if that would potentially delay or hinder the
timing in terms of closing the deal in the first quarter.
