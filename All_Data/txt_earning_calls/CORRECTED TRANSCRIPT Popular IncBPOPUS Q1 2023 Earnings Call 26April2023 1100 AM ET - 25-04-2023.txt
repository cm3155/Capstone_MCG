Q1 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
Javier D. Ferrer
Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer Head of Business Strategy & Corporate Secretary, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Paul. Good morning and thank you for joining the call.
We began the year with a strong quarter achieving net income of $159 million. Our quarterly net income was $30
million lower than the adjusted fourth quarter net income of $189 million.
First quarter results were impacted by lower net interest income, offset in part by lower expenses, higher non-
interest income, and a slightly lower provision for credit losses. Loans increased during the quarter by $261
million. Banco Popular generated loan growth across all segments, while Popular Bank saw commercial loan
growth, offset by run-off in the construction and consumer portfolios. Our net interest margin decreased by 6 basis
points [ph] to 3.22% in the quarter (2:23). Higher deposit costs, particularly in our Puerto Rico public deposit
portfolio, and the Popular Bank, impacted our margin. This was partially offset by an improvement in asset mix
due to loan growth, and a reduction of the investment portfolio. Credit quality trends remained favorable during
the period. NPLs decreased, and net charge-offs remained well-below pre-pandemic levels.
During the quarter, Popular issued $400 million in five-year Senior Notes, with a 7.25% coupon. We intend to use
a portion of the net proceeds of the offering, to redeem or repay the $300 million principal amount of our Senior
Notes that matured in September.
Please turn to Slide 4. We maintained robust liquidity, anchored by our diversified deposit franchise, and our high
levels of cash reserves and unpledged securities. Our deposit franchise is made up of approximately 42% in retail
deposits, with an average balance of less than $10,000 per account. 25% of the balances are in public sector
deposits, which are secured by collateral. 28% are in commercial deposits, and the remaining 5% are wholesale
deposits. Overall, deposits were down by $273 million in the quarter, but liquidity sources were up by $1.3 billion.
Our total consolidated borrowings, including our newly-issued Senior Notes, remained flat during the quarter. Our
customer base in Puerto Rico grew by approximately 12,000 during the quarter, reaching nearly 2 million unique
customers.
Adoption of digital channels among our retail customers remained strong. Active users on our Mi Banco platform
exceeded 1.1 million or 56% of our customer base. In addition, we continued to capture more than 60% of our
deposits through digital channels. This trend remains significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels and well above
our island peers.
In the first quarter, consumer spending remained healthy and with combined credit and debit card sales of 9%
compared to the first quarter of 2022. As on the Mainland, mortgage originations in Puerto Rico have been
impacted by rising rates and also by limited inventory of available properties. The dollar value of mortgage
originations at Banco Popular decreased by 29% compared to the first quarter of last year, driven by lower
refinance activity due to the interest rate environment.
The local economy performed well during the first quarter. Business activity is solid, and remains in good shape,
as reflected in the continued positive trends, in total employment and other published economic data. While new
auto sales have slowed compared to the quarterly pace of the past couple years, they remain above pre-
pandemic levels, evidencing continued robust demand for cars in Puerto Rico.
The tourism and hospitality sector continues to be a source of strength for the local economy. Year-to-date, San
Juan Airport has seen record levels of passenger traffic. Hotel demand also has been strong, as can be seen in
record high average daily rates and revenues per available room.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
There are still approximately $50 billion of hurricane recovery funds that have yet to be disbursed. We expect that
these funds will support economic activity in many sectors in the coming years. We are uniquely positioned to
serve the needs of our customers and to benefit from such activity.
In short, we are pleased with our results for the quarter, particularly our solid loan growth in Puerto Rico, and the
continued strength of our deposit base, liquidity and credit quality. We are mindful of and have been monitoring
the economic and market environment as well as the recent developments in the U.S. banking sector. We will
continue to manage our banks to maintain significant available liquidity as we grow responsibly. Despite these
headwinds, we remain optimistic about the future of Puerto Rico, our primary market, and our ability to manage
and serve the needs of our customers through any potential challenges that may lie ahead.
I now turn the call over to Carlos for more details on our financial results.

Carlos J. Vázquez
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Javier. Good morning. Sorry. Apologies.
Please turn to Slide 5. Net income was $159 million compared to $257 million in Q4. Excluding the impact of the
$68 million DTA allowance reversal in Q4, net income decreased by $30 million from Q1.
Net interest income was $532 million, a decrease of $28 million from Q4. $9 million of the variance was related to
the lower day count during the quarter. On a taxable equivalent basis, net interest income was [ph] $517 million
(8:28) compared to $622 million in Q4. The variance was primarily a result of higher interest expense on deposits
of $54 million, resulting from increased deposit rates, mainly from Puerto Rico public deposits and to a lesser
extent, Popular Bank.
Non-interest income was $162 million, an increase of $3 million from Q4. This include – included in this result was
a $7 million litigation-related insurance claim reimbursement. The provision for credit losses was $47 million
compared to $48 million in the fourth quarter. Total operating expenses were $441 million, a decrease of $21
million from the prior quarter. This reduction was primarily driven by lower professional fees by $16 million, as well
as lower technology and software expenses by $10 million.
Historically, these costs tend to be lower during the first quarter of every year. This is more accentuated in the first
quarter of this year due to our multi-year transformation initiatives. During Q1, we had $6 million transformation-
related expenses compared to $10 million last quarter. As the transformation progresses, expenses will shift from
advisory and conceptual plans to the development and execution of implementation plans. As a result, we expect
a slower pace of expenditure initially as in Q1 and then acceleration as the year progresses. We continue to
anticipate transformation-related expenses of $50 million in 2023.
Other large expense variances were lower seasonal business promotion expenses by $9 million, which was
somewhat offset by higher personnel cost by $9 million, primarily related to the previously disclosed increase in
hourly minimum wage at BPPR that took effect in January, and lower OREO benefit of $7 million, mostly due to
lower gain on sale of properties. Our quarterly expense trajectory has historically ramped up as the year
progresses. We anticipate that 2023 will be consistent with that experience, and continue to expect expenses for
the year of approximately $1.87 billion.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23%. For the full year 2023, we expect the effective tax rate to be within
the range of 21% to 26%, higher than the range provided during our last webcast. In the near-term, we expect to
run our banks with a higher level of reserves at the Fed, which leads to less tax-exempt income and therefore a
higher tax rate than we have previously anticipated.
Please turn to Slide 6. Net interest income was $532 million. On a taxable equivalent basis, it was $570 million,
$51 million lower than in the fourth quarter. Net interest margin decreased by 6 basis points to 3.22% in Q1. On a
taxable equivalent basis, NIM was 3.46%, a decrease of 18 basis points. The decrease is driven by higher
interest expense on deposits due to a significant, though anticipated 103 basis point increase in the cost of public
deposits. This was partially offset by higher loan balances and yields, plus an improved mix of earning assets. At
the end of the first quarter, public deposits were roughly $15.5 billion or $15.8 billion, excluding $700 million in
deposits held and managed by our trust division. This compares to $15.8 billion and $15.2 billion respectively at
year-end. In the past, we had excluded the balances in trust from our discussion about Puerto Rico public
deposits, given that these are managed by our Fiduciary Services Division where we act as custodian or escrow
agent. However, we have decided to aggregate these amounts to reflect the overall relationship with government
entities and provide more visibility to collateralized deposits. These trust deposits have always been reported in
our total deposit bonds.
During 2023, now inclusive of trust deposits, we expect public deposits to be in a range of $14 billion to $16
billion, essentially unchanged from our previous expectations of $13 billion to $15 billion that excluded trust
deposits. It's important to reiterate that by law in Puerto Rico, public deposits must be 100% collateralized. Any
decrease in the level of these deposits will have no significant impact on our liquidity. Excluding Puerto Rico
public deposits, consolidated deposit balances increased by [ph] $180 million (13:52) in the quarter, primarily time
and saving deposits at Popular Bank gathered through a direct channel. This compares to a decrease of $1.4
billion in non-public deposits during the fourth quarter.
In Q1, we continued to see some commercial and high net worth clients pursuing better yields on excess liquidity
moving these funds outside the banking sector. However, we have been able to capture a good portion of these
movements in our broker dealer, which saw an increase in assets under management of approximately [ph] $450
million (14:28). Since the end of Q1, overall deposits have increased by approximately $700 million.
Our interest rate sensitivity continues to be relatively neutral. As the year progresses, we expect the margin to
resume an upward trajectory. The timing will depend on the interaction of our loan growth and mix, deposit
balances, and the pace of repricing of public and incrementally non-public deposits. Our hedging loan balances
increased by $161 million compared to Q4 driven by growth on all loan segments at BPPR and commercial loans
at PB. We are encouraged by the demand for credit at BPPR and PB. We will continue to take advantage of
opportunities to extend credit, thereby improving the use and yield of our existing liquidity.
Please turn to Slide 7. [ph] Deposit beta's recurring tightening cycle (15:34) are now at or above the prior cycle.
We have seen a total cumulative deposit beta of 24% to date. However, in Q1, we saw an acceleration of deposit
pricing. In BPPR, total deposit cost increased by 35 basis points, led by public sector deposits. In PB, total deposit
cost increased by 67 points, led by retail deposits as we increased the use of our online deposit channel. In
Puerto Rico, our combined retail and commercial deposit beta cycle to date have been less than 10%. As we've
discussed over the past couple of quarters, given the rapid shift to higher short-term interest rates, we expected a
significant increase in the cost of public deposits. In the first quarter, the cost increased by 103 basis points
versus our January estimate of roughly 120 basis points. The difference rests in lower average balances and the
mechanics of the interest expense calculation.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
We expect the cost of public deposits to increase by approximately 60 basis points in Q2. The deposit pricing
agreement with the Puerto Rico public sector is market linked with a lag. This source of funding resulted in an
attractive spread on our market rates.
Please turn to Slide 8. We have added the following two slides in our deck because of the increased focus on
liquidity, borrowings, and deposit composition. Liquidity sources for the corporation increased by $1.3 billion in
Q1. 77% of this liquidity resides in excess funds at the Fed and unpledged securities.
Borrowings for the quarter were flat at $1.4 billion. We reduced our Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings by $366
million in Q1. However, the issuance of our Senior Notes due in 2028 roughly compensated for that reduction.
There were no incremental borrowings during the quarter from the Federal Home Loan Bank, the Fed discount
window or the Bank Term Funding Program.
On March 13, 2023, Popular issued $400 million of 7.25% Senior Notes due in 2028. We intend to use a portion
of the net proceeds of the offering to redeem or repay $300 million principal amount of our outstanding Senior
Notes that mature in September 2023.
Please turn to Slide 9. The summation of transactional accounts and time deposits with balances over $250,000
ended Q1 at $13.8 billion or 23% of total deposit balances. The liquidity sources described in Slide 8, the prior
slide totaled $18.3 billion, covering 135% of deposits over $250,000. The balances of our non-interest bearing
deposits have been steady. Most of our recent balance changes have been in interest bearing accounts.
Please turn to Slide 10. Our investment portfolio is almost entirely comprised of Treasury and Agency mortgage-
backed securities, which carry minimal credit risk. Including our cash position, this portfolio has an average
duration of approximately 2.6 years. As discussed previously, during the rapid increase in rates in 2022, as well
as the uncertain outlook for interest rates, in October of last year, we transferred to held-to-maturity $6.5 billion of
U.S. Treasuries, thereby reducing the future impact of rates on tangible book value. At the time, this action
reduced AOCI exposure to interest rates by about a third.
When transferred to HTM, these positions had a pre-tax unrealized loss of $873 million, which will be amortized
back into capital throughout the remaining life of the transferred positions. As of the end of the first quarter, the
balance of this unrealized loss stood at $789 million, a reduction of $43 million from Q4 and $84 million from the
transfer date. We expect this loss to be amortized back into capital through the remaining life of the portfolio at a
rate of approximately 5% per quarter through 2026.
As a result of the timing of this transfer, and given the level of rates at quarter-end, all of the unrealized losses
related to the HTM portfolio are already reflected in our tangible capital. Therefore, at the end of the quarter, there
are no significant recognized marks related to our HTM book.
Please turn to Slide 11. Our return on tangible equity was 11.5% in the quarter. Regulatory capital levels
remained strong. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio in Q1 of 16.7% increased by 34 basis points from Q4. Tangible
book value per share at quarter-end was $50.15, an increase of $5.18 per share, or almost 12% from Q4. This
improvement is driven mostly by a favorable variance of $192 million in the net unrealized losses on securities
available-for-sale and quarterly net income of $159 million, partially offset by dividends declared in the quarter.
Finally, touching on capital, we will revisit future capital actions in the second half of 2023. Our long-term outlook
and capital return has not changed, anchored in our strong regulatory capital ratios. However, in the near-term,
we need to get more certainty on the outlook for rates and the economy, and also for clarity on the potential

regulatory response to recent events in the banking sector. Over time, we expect our regulatory capital ratios to
gravitate towards the levels of our Mainland peers plus the buffer.
With that, I turn the call over to Lidio.

Lidio V. Soriano
Chief Risk Officer & Executive VP-Risk Management, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Carlos, and good morning.
Overall, Popular continue to reflect stable credit quality trends, with low levels of net charge-offs, and decreasing
NPLs. We remain encouraged by the performance of our loan book post-pandemic. Specifically, early
delinquency, net charge-offs and non-performing loan inflows continue to trend significantly below pre-pandemic
levels.
Turning to slide number 12. Non-performing assets decreased by $24 million to $504 million this quarter, driven
by an NPL decrease of $27 million due to lower mortgage and consumer NPLs in Puerto Rico, [ph] offset in part
by OREO increase of $3 million (23:01). NPL inflows increased slightly quarter-on-quarter. At the end of the
quarter, the ratio of NPLs to total loans held in portfolio decreased to 1.3% from 1.4% in the previous quarter.
Turning to slide number 13. Net charge-off amounted to $33 million, for an annualized 41 basis points of average
loans held in portfolio, compared to $31 million or 39 basis points in the prior quarter. The results for the quarter
were impacted by a $10.5 million charge-off on a previously-reserved loan. Excluding this, the net charge-off ratio
would have been [ph] 28 basis points (23:46).
Please turn to slide number 14. At the end of the first quarter, the ACL decreased by $31 million to $689 million.
During the quarter, we implemented the new accounting guidance, which eliminated accounting for [ph] BPPR
(24:04) and the requirements to measure the effect of the concession from a loan modification. This impact
resulted in a release in the ACL of approximately $46 million, driven by our mortgage TDR portfolio, which is
presented as an adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings net of tax effect. Excluding this impact,
the ACL increased by [ph] $14 million, driven by changes in the HPI forecast (24:31), higher loan volume, portfolio
mix and the migration of consumer credit scores. The provision for credit losses was $47 million compared to $48
million in the prior quarter.
To summarize, our loan portfolio continued to exhibit strong credit quality trends in the first quarter with low net
charge-offs and decreasing non-performing loans. We remain attentive to evolving environment. We remain
encouraged by the post-pandemic performance of our loan book. We believe that improvement made over time in
the risk profiles of the corporation's loan portfolio positions Popular to operate successfully on the more difficult
economic conditions.
Before I turn the call over to Javier, let me comment on [ph] Popular series of office segment exposure. The office
segment is receiving a lot of attention in the current environment, due to the achieved level of work and higher
(25:24) interest rates. In the case of Popular, our office exposure is limited, representing only 1.9% or $605 million
of our total loan portfolio. The exposure is mainly comprised of low- to mid-priced property [ph] with original size of
$2 million (25:50) and is well-diversified across payment type.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Javier for his concluding remarks. Thank you.

Javier D. Ferrer
Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer Head of Business Strategy & Corporate Secretary, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Lidio and Carlos for your updates.
Popular started off 2023 with a strong first quarter, building on the positive momentum generated in 2022. Our
diversified business model and strong deposit base, robust regulatory capital and liquidity position are a source of
strength, which allow us to continue to meet our clients' needs as reflected by the growth in our customer base
and loan portfolio during the quarter.
We are optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead and we remain vigilant around potential risks stemming
from continued inflation and economic and market uncertainty. Economic trends in Puerto Rico continue to be
positive, and a considerable amount of recovery funds yet to be disbursed are expected to support increased
economic activity in future years.
We made progress on our transformation initiatives during the quarter, which, over time, will drive more customer
connectivity, operational efficiencies, and greater potential for profitable growth and sustainable return on capital.
I want to recognize and express our gratitude to our colleagues. It is their daily effort and commitment that lead to
our customers' continued trust in Popular and our strong results.
We are now ready to answer your questions.

Brody Preston with UBS. Please proceed.

Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions.

Good morning, Brody.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
I was hoping maybe, Carlos, could we dive back into the net interest income, the FTE situation? So you – I guess,
I'm trying to understand. So, you're going to hold more cash at the Fed with both the Puerto Rican sub and the
U.S. sub. And so, that's resulting in lower levels of tax-exempt interest income. But is there – I guess, is there
some GAAP NII impact there as well? I'm just getting a few questions about it. It came across a little confusing.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
No, I think your description is correct, Brody. The cash we keep at the Fed earns tax – or it did for the bank in
Puerto Rico, by the way, mostly. It does not apply – affecting the States. It earns taxable income as opposed to
when we hold Treasury securities, a large extent – to a large extent, bank in Puerto Rico, so, our mix of taxable
and non-taxable income shifts towards taxable. So, that results in a higher – in a higher tax rate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
And will that, and will that get, I guess, will that strategy of holding higher levels of cash in the Puerto Rican sub,
will that get reversed once we get clarity on, liquidity and the economy? Or is that like kind of like holding higher
levels of cash through 2024, the expectations?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Well, at least for the moment, it is our choice. And we'll [ph] revisit that choice every week in our local community
(30:03). We'll see whether it continues to be our choice once the regulators express themselves.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. So, it seems like it's more conservatism at this point. [indiscernible] (30:19-30:22) Yes, go ahead,
[ph] Jorge (30:22).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
Yes. You asked a question about impacting GAAP NII. Given that the yield on cash overnight at the Fed versus
short-term rates is not very different, we wouldn't expect a significant difference in GAAP NII from that shift.
Certainly, our FTE NII will be affected because of that strategy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And I guess what is, I guess from this strategy, how much on a quarterly basis is the FTE impacted?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
That will be driven by everything, everything else on our, you know, the deposit costs that are disallowed, et
cetera. So, that's a little bit more complicated.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Yes. It's a little bit more complicated calculation on that one. And, of course, also depends on us, continuing the
strategy [ph] at the present level and that figure is free and outcome (31:10).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. But it is fair to say that like as deposit costs move higher if you kept the same level of cash at the Fed that
there would be an incremental drag on the FTE NII?

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. [indiscernible] (31:31-31:33) And on the fee income – okay. Okay. On the fee income, I just wanted to get a
sense for where you thought that would shake out going forward. And I'll stop there, and I'll hop back in the queue
for my other questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Now, fee income, our fee income is [ph] reasonable steady over a year, if you divide by four. But then it's harder
stating on a (31:54) quarter-by-quarter basis. So, it tends to fluctuate a little bit up and down. We're happy to have
started slightly ahead of our [ph] guidance, 150 per quarter (32:10). But for the moment, we still think that
guidance is applicable, and we'll revise that again depending on the results of the second quarter. We'll see if it is
worth the change. So for the moment, we'll keep the guidance. We're very pleased [ph] that we're excited ahead,
again, that number moves in both directions every quarter for many different reasons because of the many lines
(32:26) that are in there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And could you just remind me, Carlos? It looks like other – in the other service fees there's third quarter
upward seasonality that'll come through. That's still the expectation, right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
That's the insurance, right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Yes. I mean, there's – we get contingent insurance commissions paid out once or twice a year. It depends on the
insurance company that we have – we're dealing with. It tends to be in the second half of the year. I don't
remember it's exactly the third quarter, Brody, but it tends to be in the second half of the year. Of course, the other
thing that has to happen is that the insurance market has to behave nicely for them to pay with the contingent
fees. But that will be the second half of the year, yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Good morning. How are you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Appreciate the – good. Appreciate the comments on the expected range of public funds, kind of $14 billion to 16
billion exiting the year. Maybe talking to second quarter specifically, can you just give an update on the magnitude
of seasonal inflows you're expecting in the quarter, kind of timing of those? And then ultimately where we could
expect GAAP NIM and NII to kind of bottom out before starting the ramp higher in the back end of the year to your
comments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Yes, well the – in the second quarter we have tax revenues. So, as they were mentioned before, we expect
government deposits to go up this quarter. And we've seen some of that. We already mentioned that deposits are
up $700 million so far this quarter. So while it's harder for me to tell you as exactly if they're going to end higher
than because that depends on what the government chooses to do with their money, which is not our decision.
Historically, they have tended to be higher in the second quarter, and then gravitate down in the second half of
the year.
What was your question on NIM again Timur?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Just if you can provide any kind of magnitude on where NIM or NII could bottom in 2Q prior to resuming the ramp
higher in the back end of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
No. We usually don't give guidance on that type of detail. We – as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we still
expect NIM to take an upward trend again this year. The difficult part of that is that it depends on how the things I
mentioned interact that will give us the final, this timing on when it is going to shift. So, it's going to be a pace of
increasing rates, loan growth, and loan mix, and also deposit balances and mix. And how those three things
interact is what results in the ultimate NIM. So, we still think it's going to revert to an expansion mode this year.
But for the time being, we have not spoken over the timing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then maybe one for Lidio, excluding, the impact of 2022-02, allowance levels continue to build despite
the broader trends on the island improving. Can you maybe talk about some of the levers that were pulled within
the portfolio changes that called for incremental allowance? And what do you need to see prior to releasing some

of the incremental allowance and getting closer to a level, maybe not where Mainland peers are, but at least
starting to trend in that direction?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Chief Risk Officer & Executive VP-Risk Management, Popular, Inc.
But the thing is a lot of different levers that were applied during this quarter, as we mentioned, we have been
doing good in terms of volume. So the volume increase, they have role, small role in terms of increase in
allowance. The economic scenario also played a small role in terms of the increasing allowance. Then you also
have volume mix. We changed, we gravitated to some of our higher allowance portfolio that also had a gradual
impact in allowance, which also have seen some gravitation, some consumer score that also [ph] had a small –
impacting allowance, so a combination of a lot of small things. So, it's the interplay of all of that. And they continue
low pro forma net charge-off that will dictate allowance going forward underlying (37:28).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. And just – great. And just last for me, maybe back to Carlos. Can you provide an update on
merchant acquiring and the revenue share component, how that's trending, and maybe an outlook for both 2023
and 2024 there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Well, we don't break out that number, Timur. But we did talk about the volume of credit and debit cards going up
9% versus the same quarter last year. It will go down versus the [ph] last quarter because it fixed the lines in all
(38:15). So, the business keeps growing. We're getting a share of that. So, I presume the number is going up, but
we don't have – and I don't think we'll disclose in detail that number.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Up!
No, I mean, I'm sorry to repeat. No – as you know, we don't give specific loan balance guidance. We did say that
we expect loan growth this year, and we are seeing that. But we also expect it to be on a lower pace than we saw
last year, and we're seeing that as well.
So, the first quarter was a good quarter. It was a bit quieter than the first quarter of last year, obviously. Hopefully,
the economy locally in Puerto Rico particularly continues to grow, and more projects come online, we'll have more
[ph] opportunities to close all the expected supply. So, I'm hopeful if they get better (39:46) as the year goes
along. I do not think even when it gets better that it will come to match last year's growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And do you think growth comes from basically all categories, as you saw in the first quarter or
[indiscernible] (40:11-40:13).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Yes – so far, that's what we've seen in Puerto Rico. And that's actually been true since the middle of last year,
Alex. So we probably will continue to be in most categories. But dollar terms, obviously the category that carries
the day is commercial. So in dollars it's going to be mostly commercial, but we probably will see most categories
continue to grow. Autos is growing a bit less. That's a little bit slower than it did last year. And we'll see how that
how the year evolves. So, there is the effect of higher rates and how that affects the appetite of people for loans.
We'll have to see how that plays out during the year as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. To that last point on rates and appetite, can you give us a sense for where new loan yields are relative to
the existing portfolio for consumer? I mean, for a commercial primarily?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
I mean, the best we can do – we can do on that, Alex, is in our loans and yields on the press release, you have
loan yields by category. And you can see the variation from last quarter to this quarter. We don't provide sort of
any more detail on yields than that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Can you on – in the slide deck on the deposit slide, can you just help us understand exactly what's
happening in the commercial deposits, as well as the government deposits towards the end of the quarter? It
looks like those rates ticked down a little bit.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
Yes. I'll explain commercial, and one of my colleagues here will explain you the public sector. In the commercial,
it's actually quite simple. We had a large relationship with a profit aggregator that exited – we exited in early
February. And that was a very high cost. So, the cost actually dipped. That contributed [ph] to the transaction rate
(42:16) coming down in February and March. So, that was an actual sort of transaction decision that we did that
affected that one.
On the public deposits?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul J. Cardillo A
Investor Relations Officer, Popular, Inc.
Hey, Alex. it's Paul. So, on the public deposits, or for all the charts, we actually provide the data points as part of
the analysis on a monthly basis. And so, given a variety of inputs, including day count and average balances and
whatnot, the calculation does move around a little bit...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
And the lag.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul J. Cardillo A
Investor Relations Officer, Popular, Inc.
...along with the lagged effect of the repricing. So, if you look back prior in that chart, what you can see is it does
jump around a little bit during certain time periods, even when the – at least the comparative chart of the Fed
funds is moving directionally. So, that's all that this is. We do expect that those – that that repricing has not yet
been completed. And we talked about sort of another 60 basis points roughly in the second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. That's helpful. And then, with respect to the NIM commentary, about resuming upward trajectory, is that – is
there a scenario where that could happen in the second quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Yes. If you move around in your model, the three things I mentioned, pace of interest, rate increases, loan growth
and mix, and deposit balances and mix, I'm sure there's a number of possible combinations that will give you a
higher NIM in the second quarter. But it depends on how those three things move.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi. Thanks for the question. I think I'll carry on with that, at least a portion of that NIM question. Carlos, one of the
things that you had mentioned was you're carrying higher balances at the Fed just out of conservatism. Do you
mind sharing what you guys view as an appropriate level of cash you have on hand right now? And what are the
things we should be looking for to toggle that either up or down? Do you need clarity from the regulators in order
to take that down? Just interested in what we should be looking for as we think about the liquidity number ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Yes. I mean, to a large extent, what you see in our Fed accounts, right, in our cash position right now is a lot of
that maturity that's happened in our investment portfolio in the first quarter, minus the loan growth that we had for
the quarters. That's the outcome of those two things is the number in there. Now, we'll keep watching this closely
and evaluating the environment an ongoing basis, Kelly. So I – we don't – we're not running it on the basis of a
target amount of cash, necessarily. We are running the business. And the business results in an amount of cash.
What we did decide in the first quarter was to allow the portfolio to mature without reinvesting or extending it
again. Again, that is a discussion that we have in our weekly outcome meetings, and we evaluate all the parts,
and come to conclusions, on a dynamic basis. So there isn't a target. The level where we are at this sort of seems
to make sense to us. It's not a tough decision because at this point in time, cash, the cash – [ph] the yield in cash
is not bad. So it's not a horrible decision to have cash to the Fed. So, we'll keep looking at it, again, and that
position, though? Unlikely. Will that position be, have what it is (46:22)? Unlikely. But it will probably gravitate
around where it is. And if we make a decision to reinvest or move some of the cash to the investment portfolio, it
will not change the characteristics of our cash position because some of that will be T-bills, but it will change the
nature of our tax position.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Understood. I appreciate the color. Thinking about the buyback, in order to get more comfort, with the buyback,
do you think the Board needs the regulators to come out with additional guidelines, on that front, in with what's
gone on in March? Just any sort of color as to what could get you guys more interested in buy back stock here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Yes. I mean, what we – what we – so, what we described in October is that we wanted more clarity on rates and
the economy, so that we could be more informed in making any decision in capital return. And that we thought
that clarity may be available by the summer. Frankly, I'm not sure if we have significantly more clarity now than we
had then. So, hopefully, we get clarity by the summer, but I'm not sure we're there yet.
I think the more important thing is what you mentioned that, which we have added to those two considerations,
the consideration of regulatory changes. It is anybody's guess exactly what the regulators will come up with. We
do not know. But we will be attentive to how they are, how they are moving. We definitely don't want to be in a
position where we do something [ph] and there's a clarity announcement (48:44) a month later, and it makes our
life much more difficult because we did something that moved us in the wrong direction.

So, we'll be looking at all those things. It's hard to gauge right now [ph] whether orders will come out (49:01),
Kelly. So, we're paying attention and listening. So, it's three things now that we're waiting to get some clarity on
that too. So, we'll just see how it goes along.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. And just to sneak a last one in on the capital front is the dividend. We had discussions about the buyback.
You usually have a dividend raise in 2Q. I think that's part of your capital – whole capital discussion. But
wondering if there's any updated, even if a buyback isn't in the cards necessarily, is – are you still thinking about
the dividend the same way in any target for a payout ratio on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Yes. We tend to work the two things together. But I think that you're right in pointing out they don't have to be
together. So it's something that we will continue to consider.
Again, I mean, I think probably step back for a minute, the more important point to make is our long-term view on
capital hasn't changed. We still expect over time that our capital ratios will go in the direction of our Mainland
peers, plus a spread. But that is over time. That doesn't mean every quarter in a perfect sequence, number one.
And number two, now we have the other uncertainty that we have no idea where our peers will be required to be,
if the rules change. So, we'll have to keep those things in mind.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.

Q
Just wanted to go quickly back – yes, thanks – I just want to go quickly back to deposits. I appreciate the detail on
the liquidity and deposits slide you added. Looks like demand deposits decreased similarly to what we saw last
quarter. Do you guys expect a steady mix shift over into interest-bearing accounts from [ph] DBA (51:29)? And
then, on the deposit beta as well, you mentioned that most of the segments are at or above their prior cycle
deposit beta and, you guys, on the island, maintain an advantage to the Mainland. But just wanted to know if you
expect those betas to increase notably above the prior cycle? Thanks.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 26-Apr-2023
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Yes. On demand deposits, I think that the message in demand deposits, [ph] Brian (51:58), is that they've been
very steady, actually, and we have seen, as I mentioned, some commercial clients and some high net worth
clients seek higher yields. We have also been successful, when the clients are in that position to help them
achieve that without leaving the relationship or shrinking the relationship with us.
We had increase in assets under management of Popular securities [ph] of over $400 million – over $450 million
(52:31) in the first quarter, which is exactly that. But the fact that that happened and you see the demand deposits
from the fourth to the first quarter were flat, means that somebody else brought in $450 million. So, demand
deposits have been quite steady, actually.
Most of the volatility we've seen in the volume or the levels have been in our interest-bearing accounts. And, as
you know, some of the big chunks or big movements happen in our public sector accounts that are our large
depositors, right?
And I'm sorry, but I missed the second part of your question, [ph] Brian (53:12).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Just on the...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Oh, the deposit...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
...deposit betas, compared to the prior cycle.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Yes. Well, we've seen deposit betas accelerate, as probably every bank in the country has. So, the rates have
gone up so fast and so high. So, we are above the last cycle. So, I don't think we have to – the chances are, that
the betas for all banks will probably end up higher than last cycle in this cycle, just because of the speed and
magnitude of how the Fed raise rates. So, that's probably what's going to end up happening.
Specifically in our case, it's hard to tell. When you look at, for example, a big chunk of our deposit business, which
is retail and commercial, and Puerto Rico continues to have a sub-10% beta. So, overall, betas will accelerate, I
think, is our view. They are already be – above the last cycle. There's a reasonable [ph] chance that the overall
beta (54:19) will be higher than the last cycle. But there is pieces of our business that continue to show a lot of
strength, particularly the non-public pricing in Puerto Rico.

Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Hi, Thomas.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Leddy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
A couple of quarters ago, you guys mentioned that you had not seen any new entrants into the market for lending
and PR, such as from Mainland banks that haven't historically been as active there. But you thought you might
see some increased competition for some of the big pending infrastructure projects there. Has that dynamic
changed at all in light of recent events and any additional color you can provide there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
I don't think it changed very much. It really is, the size of the investment is important obviously, because not every
bank can make every sized loan. But when you have foreign operators that come into Puerto Rico to run a public-
private partnership, for example, they have worldwide banking relationships, and those relationships arrive to
Puerto Rico with them. In almost every instance, they want a local bank with our experience and capabilities to
help them. So we end up either leading or being an important part of any effort to finance those kind of projects.
So, I don't think that it's a change from what we've experienced in the past. And hopefully, some of these projects
will get going pretty soon. There's a number of the public-private partnerships that are supposed to be closer to
realization now than they were months ago. And if does happen, that would be a welcome event.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey, guys. Just had a couple of quick follow-ups. I did want to touch on the consumer line of credit charge-offs
that you called out. Just I wanted to clarify. It was called the line of credit. I just wanted to ask if that was one line
of credit or if that was multiple lines of credit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lidio V. Soriano A
Chief Risk Officer & Executive VP-Risk Management, Popular, Inc.
It was one line of credit. It is a legacy one-off type of relationship that shouldn't recur in the future.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And then, I just want to ask one on the deposit mix. You guys outperformed the industry, by a wide
margin, on non-interest bearing. So, just wanted to get a sense for what your conversations look like with
customers around rates, particularly as it relates to like, any level of excess funds that might be [ph] in DDAs
(58:32). Or do you feel like the non-interest-bearing mix can be relatively steady from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Yes. I mean, we have the discussions every day, every day, every day. I mean, the best way I can answer that
question, Brody, is that we've been having those discussions for the last two quarters, and the results are the
results.
So, we – despite the fact that we're having those discussions that we have clients moving cash, seeking higher
yields. We still were able to successfully maintain stable demand deposit balances. That does not mean that
some money did not move. As I said, we can track specifically $450 million of those volumes that moved to

through our broker dealer. But, clearly, we successfully found another $450 million of demand deposits that [ph]
showed up and joined the bank (59:35).
So, so far, we've been able to manage those interests of higher yields from our clients successfully. We're
keeping the relationship. We're serving the client. By the way, we've been here before, and those flows grow by
back the other way when rates come down. So, the important thing here is to keep the relationship, so that when
rates come down, the money does flow back into the bank.
So, I mean, that's the best – my best guess. Javier, you want?

I just want to add that we saw we saw a very strong new deposit account opening numbers for the first quarter in
Puerto Rico, including non-interest-bearing accounts. So, I just wanted to clarify that very high compared to prior
quarters.

Carlos J. Vázquez A

(60:30).

Javier D. Ferrer A

Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Timur?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yes. Sorry about that. I had you on mute. Thanks for the follow-up. One last one for me on the expense base.
Appreciate the color on the reduction in the first quarter, and the expectation for it to ramp higher as the year
goes. Any additional commentary on the cadence of that increase to get to that unchanged guidance level?
And then, secondarily, if you can provide any kind of color as to what type of internal budget you're using for this
year's profit-sharing initiative.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Okay. On the second question, there is personally no incorporation of any profit sharing in our numbers or our
forward-looking. So, nothing on that is in our numbers or our forward-looking outlook at this point in time.
On your first question, it's tough to tell because it depends on when the projects get going and when the people
that are helping us in this project actually bill us. So, I would assume that it will be straight line up. That would be
my best assumption right now for – in the next three quarters to reach the goal. But it's the best I can do.
I have a colleague here telling me – what? What? So, this is my – do it straight line in your model. It's probably not
going to be far from the truth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul J. Cardillo A
Investor Relations Officer, Popular, Inc.
I'll just clarify. We don't – we do accrue [indiscernible] (62:57-62:59) on services provided, we don't wait for being
billed necessarily.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul J. Cardillo A
Investor Relations Officer, Popular, Inc.
But of course...

Timur F. Braziler Q

And then, I guess once of those projects...

Javier D. Ferrer A
Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer Head of Business Strategy & Corporate Secretary, Popular, Inc.
[ph] This is a better for expenses (63:07).

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
I'm sorry?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
I guess once those projects start to ramp-up, is the expectation going forward that those expenses remain on or is
it going to be as lumpy as we've seen in the first quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Popular, Inc.
Well, it will depend on the project, Brody – sorry, Timur. If it's a – if it's a – it will depend on the project. I don't
think there's a global answer to your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
The project and the number of projects that are ongoing at the same time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Makes sense.

A

going.

Timur F. Braziler Q
