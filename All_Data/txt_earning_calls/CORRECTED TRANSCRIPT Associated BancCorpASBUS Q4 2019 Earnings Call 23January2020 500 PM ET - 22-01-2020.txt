Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
Thank you, Hector, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call. Joining me today are Chris
Niles, our CFO; and Pat Ahern, our Deputy Chief Credit Officer. Pat is succeeding the current Chief Credit Officer,
John Hankerd.
We'd like to begin by extending our gratitude to John for his 15 years of service at Associated and wish him a
well-earned retirement after almost 40 years in banking. We welcome Pat to his responsibilities and know that his
30 years of banking experience including 9 at Associated will serve the bank well.
Turning to slide 3, in 2019, we faced an interest rate dynamic that was significantly different than the environment
for which we had positioned the bank at the end of 2018. Going into the year, our expectation was for two rate
increases. However, as we all know, the Fed cut rates 3 times, and we spent much of the year repositioning the
balance sheet for a lower rate environment.
We reduced our higher cost network transaction deposits from $2.3 billion at the end of 2018 to $1.3 billion at the
end of 2019, and we sold $1 billion of lower-yielding investment securities. Aided by the Huntington branch
transaction, we increased our low-cost deposit mix from 51% to 56% at the end of the year.
Since we couldn't control market interest rates, we focused on controlling our costs. We reduced our absolute
non-interest expense by $28 million year-over-year even while we added 14 net branches from Huntington in
June.
We continued to benefit from positive credit trends and our overall credit metrics have remained stable as we
further de-risked our oil and gas portfolio. We remain committed to disciplined underwriting standards. We built
capital ahead of the CECL implementation that occurred on the first of this year while continuing to deploy capital
in accordance with our stated priorities. We increased our dividend by 11%, and we repurchased $177 million of
common stock.
Turning to slide 4, we highlight our 2019 loan trends. Year-over-year we had solid growth in our commercial and
business loan portfolio, particularly in general commercial lending and in our power and utilities vertical.
Commercial and business lending balances were up 9% year-over-year despite shrinking in the fourth quarter.
This portfolio represents 36% of our total loan book at year-end, and our largest single industry exposure remains
the manufacturing and wholesale trade sector.
Our commercial real estate portfolio faced significant headwinds in late 2018 and early 2019 from higher than
expected paydown activity. However, we returned to growth in the second quarter of 2019 and are optimistic that
this positive trend will continue throughout 2020. Commercial real estate comprises about a quarter of our total
loans, and growing the CRE balances as a share of total loans is a focus of our management team this year.
The CRE portfolio is well-diversified by geography, property type and borrower, with about one-third of our CRE
loans in multi-family properties. Our exposure to retailers remains very modest, and our construction exposure
remain near 6% at the end of the year. Our residential mortgage book was up slightly in 2019, represented about
36% of the total loan book at year-end. Portfolio growth in 2019 was negatively impacted by the sale of $240
million in prepayment-sensitive mortgages in the third quarter.
Fourth quarter loan trends are highlighted on slide 5. Our commercial and business portfolio had a challenging
quarter with declines in general commercial lending, REITs and the oil and gas book. However, power and utilities
had another strong quarter; and with several credits booked late in the quarter, we expect continued growth in this
vertical in 2020.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
CRE continued its rebound with modest growth in the fourth quarter despite seasonal headwinds. Average
balances in the residential mortgage book decreased in the quarter as a result of the previously mentioned sale of
mortgages late in the third quarter. However, we remained Wisconsin's most active mortgage lender in 2019 and
grew originations in the fourth quarter, giving us positive momentum as we head into 2020.
Turning to slide 6, as shown in the left graph, our oil and gas balances decreased by nearly $100 million from the
end of Q3 to the end of Q4. After wrapping up the fall borrowing base redetermination period, we benefited from
more credit resolutions and payoffs than we previously anticipated. Looking ahead, we expect balances in this
portfolio will stabilize as we've neared the completion of the planned de-risking.
In the middle graph, power and utility balances have grown by $300 million over the last five quarters. We
anticipate that trend will continue into 2020.
Our commercial real estate pipeline remains strong, as seen in the right-hand graph. Unfunded commitments
have increased nearly $400 million to $2 billion since the third quarter of 2018 and have risen for four consecutive
quarters. Looking forward, we expect to grow our average total loans by 2% to 4% in 2020.
Turning to slide 7, we highlight our annual deposit trends. Average deposits grew 3% or approximately $660
million from a year ago, driven primarily by the Huntington branch acquisition. We've met our Huntington deposit
retention goals and expect the same success with First Staunton.
The graphs on the right side of the slide highlight the progress we've made in improving our deposit mix while
growing overall deposit balances. At the end of 2019, our mix of low-cost deposits was 56%, up from 51% at the
end of 2018.
While our deposit mix had been trending positively over the last several years, the jump in lower cost deposits we
saw in 2019 is the result of our balance sheet repositioning efforts. These efforts also led to the continued
reduction of our network transaction deposits. 2019 year-end balances of these higher-cost funds fell 41% from
2018 and now just represents 6% of our total deposits. The remixing of our deposits contributed to the 37-basis-
point reduction in interest-bearing deposit costs over the past two quarters of 2019.
Fourth quarter deposit details are on slide 8. Fourth quarter average deposits were down $1.1 billion from the
third quarter as our funding needs declined with the sale of lower-yielding securities and prepayment-sensitive
residential mortgages. These asset reductions enabled us to re-price certain high-cost deposit categories lower,
including some of our non-core price-sensitive depositors to withdraw funds.
Net outflows from time deposits and money market accounts totaled $700 million. Most of these outflows were
public funds, while interest-bearing demand average balances were also down about $300 million. This was due
to seasonal outflows as municipal customers [ph] drew on their (00:09:10) operating accounts. We also continued
the reduction of our network deposit balances in the quarter decreasing these high-cost deposits by over $300
million.
While we anticipate these balances may increase in the first quarter of 2020 as we experience additional
seasonal deposit outflows and we fund anticipated draws on commercial loans, we expect the addition of First
Staunton deposits will mitigate the overall level of non-core deposits and further reduce our cost of funding.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
While our loan-to-deposit ratio will remain somewhat seasonal, we anticipate maintaining this ratio under a 100%
funding the majority of our loan growth with core deposits, and a lower total cost to deposits given note that rate
increases.
Turning to slide 9, our investment portfolio declined to $5.6 billion as we sold securities and let balances run off to
pay down higher-cost funding. We decreased lower-yielding taxable securities by approximately $400 million,
while we increased our tax exempt balance slightly. Our portfolio yield increased as we retain less short-duration
securities and added higher-yielding, longer-duration muni bonds. We expect our securities book to trough in the
first quarter and anticipate holding the balance at about 17% of total assets.
Turning to slide 10, our full year net interest income was $836 million, down $44 million from 2018, and our net
interest margin was 2.86%, down 11 basis points from the previous year. The lower net interest income and
margin were caused by several factors.
First, we had $20 million less in acquisition related prepayments and purchased loan accretion in 2019 than we
did in 2018. Second, our deposits re-priced higher in the first part of 2019 as they continued to be affected by the
rate hike cycle that ended in late 2018. Its lag effect is typical during rate cycles and often persists for some
months after the final rate hike.
Third, our commercial loan yields were negatively impacted by Fed rate decreases in 2019. This effect was
exacerbated by LIBOR to Fed funds compression as LIBOR rates decreased in anticipation of Fed action. This
led to lower LIBOR based asset yields while the rates on our Fed index funding held steady until the actual Fed
action dates.
Turning to slide 11, we highlight fourth quarter net interest margin trends. Net interest income was $200 billion,
down $6 million from the previous quarter as our repositioning efforts resulted in a smaller balance sheet.
However, our net interest margin increased 2 basis points from the third quarter as the decrease in our funding
costs outpaced asset yield reductions.
The net interest margin results were driven by dynamics on both sides of the balance sheet. On the asset side,
average one-month LIBOR in the fourth quarter decreased 39 basis points from the third quarter, negatively
impacting commercial loan yields. However, long-term rates were relatively steady, reducing refinancing activity
and stabilizing residential mortgage yields.
Our investment portfolio yield increased slightly as lower-yielding securities ran off or were sold and we increased
the mix of higher yielding municipal bonds. On the liability side, our balance sheet repositioning strategy resulted
in lower funding costs in the fourth quarter. Total interest-bearing deposits and total interest-bearing liabilities
decreased 25 basis points and 21 basis points, respectively.
Looking ahead, we expect our deposit cost to continue to decline in the first quarter although at a slower pace
than what we saw in the third and fourth quarters of 2019. We anticipate our asset yields will stabilize, resulting in
a full year 2020 net interest margin between 2.8% and 2.85% assuming a stable interest rate environment.
Turning to slide 12, we highlight annual non-interest income. Total non-interest income for the year was $381
million, up $25 million from 2018. The increase from the previous year was driven by higher net mortgage banking
income which was up $12 million from 2018. Gains on investments also contributed to the year-over-year
increase.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
We anticipate the mobile and digital loan application technology investments we made in 2019, including solutions
for mortgages, consumer loans, and business loan applications will help facilitate revenue growth in the coming
year. For 2020, we expect total non-interest income to be between $375 million and $385 million excluding
investment gains and losses.
Slide 13, we show non-interest expense trends. Actual non-interest expense was $794 million, below our initial
guidance for the year of $800 million and $28 million below the prior year's level. Controlling costs has long been
a focus here at Associated and 2019 was no different, our non-interest expense was down year-over-year even
with the exclusion of acquisition and restructuring-related costs which were elevated in 2018. The year-over-year
decrease was achieved despite the additional operating expenses of the Huntington branches acquired in June of
2019.
We recently took actions to keep our costs in check for 2020 and beyond. While we incurred $3 million in
restructuring-related charges in the fourth quarter, we anticipate the restructuring will enable us to maintain flat to
modestly lower non-interest expenses in 2020, including the full absorption of First Staunton's costs.
While we maintain our focus on controlling costs, we understand that we need to continue investing in technology
that will further improve operational efficiency and enhance our digital presence and capabilities. We've increased
our technology spending by more than 25% over the past four years, and we expect this trend will continue.
So looking ahead to 2020, we expect total non-interest expense to be between $790 million and $795 million,
including the cost of converting and operating First Staunton.
On slide 14, we summarized the annual credit quality trends of the loan book. During 2019, the credit environment
remained benign and our credit metrics generally improved. Potential problem loans decreased $93 million from
the end of 2018. Our provision for credit losses was $16 million, up from zero in 2018, but down from $26 million
in 2017.
As we've previously noted, we've already provided for and reserved against the risks we currently see in the oil
and gas portfolio. We anticipate future oil and gas loan losses are manageable and within our historical patterns
of normal provisioning. The allowance for loan losses at the end of 2019 was 0.88%, down from the third quarter
and previous years.
As part of the implementation of CECL this quarter, we expect to incur an after tax equity adjustment of $70
million to $80 million, which will reduce our tangible common equity ratio by 21 to 24 basis points, as expected.
On slide 15, we highlight our strong capital position. In 2019, we maintained our disciplined approach to capital
deployment. We built up capital in preparation for CECL implementation while we adhered to our stated priorities
to support organic growth, pay a competitive dividend, pursue in-market efficiency driven acquisitions and
repurchase shares.
We increased our dividend 11% in 2019 and have grown the dividend by 68% since 2015. We deployed capital
through the Huntington branch acquisition, and we returned $177 million to shareholders through common stock
repurchases.
To sum up, on slide 16, we state our 2020 outlook which reflects our expectations of a stable economy and the
closure of the First Staunton transaction in February. We expect 2% to 4% annual average loan growth and to

maintain our loan-to-deposit ratio under 100%. We anticipate our full year 2020 net interest margin will be
between 2.8% and 2.85%, assuming a stable interest rate environment.
Non-interest income is expected to be between $375 million-$385 million; non-interest expense anticipated to be
between $790 million and $795 million, including acquisition-related costs in connection with the First Staunton
transaction.
We expect a 2020 effective tax rate between 19% and 21%. Our loan loss provision is anticipated to adjust with
changes in risk grade, other indications of credit quality and loan volume. And, finally, we expect to continue to
deploy capital through our stated priorities and we'll continue to operate with at least a 7% tangible common
equity ratio.
With that, we'll open it up to your questions.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Couple quick ones for you. Just in terms of the guidance, I
know it's pretty small in the grand scheme of things, but does the guidance, outside of expenses, include or
exclude First Staunton? And I guess specifically where I'd be most curious is in the margin guidance. Is there any
additional purchase accounting adjustment baked into there or is that kind of a clean margin guide of 2.80% to
2.85%?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yes. It's clean margin guide and all the First Staunton stuff is included in all the guidance we gave you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Okay. So nothing too significant there. All right. And then final question, just I think you also put in the release
there was an 18% sequential increase in potential problem loans anything in particular there or is that just kind of
normal ebbs and flows?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
No, we're dealing with such absolute low levels of potential problem loans that year-over-year they're down, they
were up a little bit in the back half of the year, but it doesn't seem systemic and we're not concerned about it.

I was hoping you could discuss maybe your thoughts on insurance and mortgage banking in 2020. It looks like the
insurance dipped a little bit in the fourth quarter so within the context of that $375 million to $385 million, if you
could just provide some commentary there, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
The insurance business is inherently a slow growing business. We did a number of acquisitions We didn't do any
this past year. We'll see what happens in the coming year, but the $375 million to $385 million assumes a steady
state for the insurance biz and it assumes a lower run rate of mortgage banking income than what we enjoyed in
the back half of the year given rate stabilization.

Hey, Phil and Chris, on slide 5, that decline in general commercial, you may have touched on a little bit, but can
you go into detail a little bit more on that, what really drove that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
It was kind of across the board. I think we feel it's pretty anomalous. We're not really terribly concerned. We
anticipate pretty robust loan growth this coming year. We expect the general commercial lines to grow. We
certainly expect commercial real estate to grow. Commercial real estate is sitting on $2 billion of unfunded
commitments. They had their best year for new production ever in 2019. More than $2.8 billion of new
transactions. So, that $2 billion, a significant amount of that will fund up in addition to the new work they're doing
now. So the combination of reasonable expectations in commercial banking, strong expectations in commercial
real estate, steady growth in resi mortgage, makes us feel pretty confident that we're going to hit that 2% to 4%.

Okay. Good. That helps. And then the comment you made on the securities portfolio. I just do the simple math
and I think it suggests maybe it bottoms on around $5.5 billion in Q1, is that the right way to think about it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. It's definitely going to bottom out at roughly 17% of assets during Q1, and we're basically bouncing around
the bottom now, and it won't grow other than – in proportion to our balance sheet as they move through 2020.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
It's been great this winter. Last one, Chris, I know you've done a lot of thinking about CECL. How should we think
about the provision for 2020? Maybe you had a little bit of an increase in the state of reserves, but how do you
want us to think about your provision?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So in general, we think our provision should have less volatility under CECL so it should essentially track
growth in the portfolio, would be our baseline, and we will anticipate, again we've got some nice cross
anticipations but – and the overall nature of the portfolio environment. And we've been on a positive or benign
credit environment and there's no reason to believe that's going to stop here at December 31. So there's some
positive general portfolio trends which will be partially offset by the growth trend we see going forward, but
generally less volatile provision going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And it shows like most of your cleanup in energy is done as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. We feel – we've reduced that portfolio substantially, another $100 million in the fourth quarter. We don't see
a whole lot of charge-offs left, and for stuff that we're worried on about beyond that, the contribution we're making
to CECL here in this quarter should cover our worries. So I feel pretty good about where we are in that.

Hey. Great. Thanks for the question. Phil, in terms of capital, you talked about a 7% flow on the tangible ratio.
Can you speak to inorganic growth opportunities? I think in the past you said one or two small deals a year would

we have discussions going on. What I've said about the possibility of an MOE is there's a limited number of
options and we're always open to talking to anyone about what makes sense for our shareholders as well as

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Chris actually hit one of my questions, but any thoughts on acquiring business lines or
portfolios apart from your comments on potential whole bank deals?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. You saw us do the Huntington branch transaction which, at the end of the day, was almost all deposits and
buying a portion of what Huntington has, buying out their Wisconsin stuff. So we're always open to looking at non-
whole bank deals. We're particularly interested in looking at opportunities like we had with Huntington, where we
can continue to grow low-cost core deposits. Those kind of opportunities are few and far between, of course. But
to the extent something came up, we would certainly be interested in that. As far as looking at loan books and
portfolios, we're open to that, but it's not as high a priority as continuing to build out the deposit base.

Jared Shaw Q

And, of course, we continue to be interested in asset management-related opportunities should they present
themselves and...

And insurance transactions as well, yeah.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Then, on the CRE portfolio, can you comment on what you're seeing in terms of payoff/paydown trends and
what your expectations are around that as you look going into 2020? Do you expect that to stay stable or
potentially increase or decrease?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So we had a real rush of payoffs back end of 2018, leaking into 2019. That has abated somewhat, and we
don't expect any elevated payoff activities. So the funding up of a couple billion dollars of commitments that are
on our books, coupled with new production, minus reasonable level of payoffs, and there's always plenty of
payoffs. I mean, it's the nature of the commercial real estate business that it's somewhat of a hamster wheel of
making new loans, having loans payoff. That's how it's supposed to work for banks. But we're going to be net
ahead and should be healthily net ahead this year.

Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from line of Michael Young with SunTrust Robinson
Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask about the appetite for residential mortgage on balance
sheet production in 2020. Is that impacted by CECL and do you view that at all as an alternative to securities book
growth? Just kind of to get your high level thoughts there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. So the securities book is going to remain at a lower level than we've historically held, as Chris said, around
that 70% range. So to the extent the balance sheet expands with loans, that will creep up a bit. The residential
mortgage stuff, it's a good point. Clearly, CECL causes more credit to be attracted to those loans. So we're going
to be very deliberate about what goes on the balance sheet. We have a very active origination, sale, retain
service model here and we'll continue to look at continuing that model. But I think it's fair to say that we have
some reticence to put lower-yielding residential mortgages that attract significantly more capital because of the
accounting rules than they used to on the balance sheet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Okay. And just to follow up on the technology and equipment expense, can you talk about where kind of new
dollars are being put to work? Maybe how much of that is kind of customer experience-driven versus efficiency
efforts, et cetera?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. It turns out that usually improving the digital customer experience also leads to more efficiency, so we're
now up to about 80% of our mortgage applications are rolling through our blend application that we rolled out
earlier this year that causes significant efficiency with the digitization of that application from the moment that
someone starts typing on their computer or their phone or their tablet.
Most of our efforts are customer-facing so that we remain relevant and more than competitive with many of our
competitors in our footprint, and that'll continue. But we also have other significant technology projects that we've
completed. We recently completed a complete revamping of our marketing campaign management system, which
automates a lot of our ability to digitally connect with customers and send out hundreds and thousands or millions
of e-mails in an efficient manner. So that's both a customer-facing technology but clearly drives efficiency and
accuracy in the back shop. So I'd say it's both but it's more heavily weighted toward the customer experience.

Operator: Your next question is a follow-up from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your
question.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, guys. Thank you. I was just curious on the overall credit portfolio. I guess if we're sort of nearing the end of
energy-related charge-offs, as you finished de-risking that portfolio, where are your non-energy charge-offs
running these days? Maybe in terms of basis points would be great. I know they're very small but I'm just trying to
get a sense for what the expectation for total charge-offs would be if we're kind of sunsetting on the issues in the
energy portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. I mean, that's always hard to prognosticate because any one charge-off can drive that. In this past quarter,
we had $14 million of net charge-offs, a little less than $10 million were oil and gas related, most of the rest of it
was some mortgage and other consumer assets. So the vast bulk of our charge-offs this past year were oil and
gas and the remainder was next to nothing. I don't have the basis points in front of me but it's probably a single-
digit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Okay. All right. Perfect. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yes.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 23-Jan-2020
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would
like to turn the call back to Philip Flynn for closing remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us today. We feel well-positioned going into 2020. The efforts we made to
reposition our balance sheet for the rate environment we're in, we believe, will pay dividends.
We're in we believe will pay dividends. We should have a stable net interest margin potentially rising a little bit.
You saw the results in the fourth quarter of our NIM actually going up 2 basis points. We feel good about our loan
growth. We will manage expenses as we always do and we believe we're in a benign credit environment. So I
think we're well-positioned to perform well in 2020.
We look forward to welcoming our First Staunton customers and colleagues in February, and we look forward to
talking to all of you in April. And as always, if you have any questions, give us a call, and thanks again for your
interest in Associated.
