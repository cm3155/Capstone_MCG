Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group First Quarter 2021 Earnings
Conference Call. My name is Alan, and I'll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only
mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event
is being recorded.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may
begin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kristin Silberberg
Head-Investor Relations, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and
CEO, Bruce Van Saun, and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of first quarter results referencing our
presentation, which you can find on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we'll be happy to take
questions. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking, is also here to provide additional color. Don McCree,
Head of Commercial Banking, who usually joins us, has a personal conflict today.
Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that
might cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on page 2 of the
presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures. So, it's important to review our GAAP results on
page 3 of the presentation and the reconciliation in the appendix.
With that, I will hand over to Bruce.

Bruce Winfield Van Saun
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Thanks, Kristin. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We're pleased to get off to a good
start to 2021, as our business model continues to demonstrate strength, diversification and resilience,
notwithstanding continuing impacts from the pandemic. We continue to focus on taking good care of customers,
highlighted by $1.8 billion of PPP loans in the latest round of the program.
We've kept our colleagues safe and productive, and we continue to drive benefits to our communities through
various grants and strong levels of volunteerism. Our strategic initiatives remain on track and will lead to
increasing differentiation and growth in franchise value versus peers over time. Our financial headlines are terrific,
though they're flattered by a large reserve release given the improved economic outlook. We delivered underlying
Q1 EPS of $1.41, an ROTCE of 17.6%, while our CET1 ratio grew to 10.1%, and our liquidity remains elevated
with an 81% quarter-end loan-to-deposit ratio.
The first half of the year can be thought of as a transition period for us in terms of PPNR, as the record levels of
mortgage revenues normalize. While we are still seeing strong levels of originations, both refi and purchase,
elevated margins have been returning to historical levels as industry capacity has expanded and competition has
intensified.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
We currently expect mortgage revenues broadly to bottom in Q2 and then stabilize in the second half. During the
first quarter, we saw strength in capital markets and wealth fees, which partially offset the drop in mortgage fees.
This should continue into Q2 and we should start to see loan growth pick up as well, which provides a further
offset.
The outlook for the second half PPNR is strengthening, as we expect loan growth plus a stabilized NIM, given the
steeper curve, to help deliver top line growth. This, combined with strong pull-through of our TOP benefits and
overall expense discipline, should result in healthy levels of positive operating leverage in Q3, Q4 and the second
half along with return to solid PPNR growth.
The outlook for credit also continues to brighten. With a negative provision of $140 million in the first quarter, our
ACL ratio ex PPP loans is now 2.03%. This compares with our day one ACL upon CECL adoption of 1.47%. So,
there's likely still more to go on reserve releasing, assuming the economic outlook continues to firm and clarify.
All of our credit trends continue to be favorable both on the Consumer and Commercial side. We've moved our
charge-off guidance for full-year 2021 to 35 to 45 basis points from the initial guidance of 50 to 65 basis points.
So, to sum up, we feel we're off to a great start, the economic outlook continues to improve, and we are executing
well on the initiatives that will position us over time as a top-performing bank.
With that, I'll turn it over to John.

John F. Woods
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. We reported
underlying net income of $626 million and EPS of $1.41. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 17.6%, which
includes the impact of a sizable reserve release. Revenue of $1.7 billion was broadly stable year-over-year,
strong fee income offsetting the impact of the low rate environment on NII. Highlights include continued strength
in capital markets, record results in wealth, and well-controlled expenses.
We recorded a negative provision for credit losses of $140 million, which reflects strong credit performance with
lower charge-offs, an improving loan portfolio profile and an improving macroeconomic outlook, with our ACL ratio
now at 2.03% excluding PPP loans. And finally, we are in a very strong capital position with CET1 at 10.1% after
returning $262 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. We also continued
to grow our tangible book value per share, which was $32.79 at quarter-end, up 3% compared with a year ago.
Next, I'll refer to a few of the slides and give you some key takeaways for the first quarter. I'll then outline our
outlook for the second quarter and provide some comments on 2021. Net interest income on slide 6 was down
1% linked quarter given lower day count. Loan balances were broadly stable and net interest margin was up
slightly. The net interest margin improvement reflects a steepening yield curve and continued discipline on deposit
pricing.
Interest-bearing deposit costs are down 7 basis points to 20 basis points, which more than offset the impact of
lower asset yields. We expect that elevated deposit levels from recent stimulus will continue to impact margin in
the near-term. We will continue to be proactive in pricing down deposits and pursuing attractive loan growth
opportunities in areas like point-of-sale finance and education, as well as in attractive Commercial segments.
The steepening of the curve provided us with the opportunity to begin adding to our hedge positions to moderate
our asset sensitivity. We added $7 billion of five-year receive-fixed cash flow swaps and terminated some pay-

fixed swaps during the course of the quarter. Those actions, combined with expected balance sheet changes,
reduced our asset sensitivity to about 8.5% from 10.8% at the end of the year.
Referring to slide 7, we delivered solid fee results again this quarter, reflecting our ongoing efforts to invest in and
diversify our revenue streams. As expected, mortgage fees were down approximately 15% this quarter despite
strong volumes, as heightened competition and increased industry capacity pressured gain on sale margins.
Nonetheless, mortgage fees were still strong compared to a year ago and we expect a continued strong level of
originations across all channels over 2021 as the market shifts to be more balanced between refi and purchase
activities.
2021 is expected to be the strongest home purchase market in history, only restrained by housing inventory.
Wealth fees were a record, up 12% linked quarter, reflecting an increase in AUM from net inflows and strong
market levels with record sales. Capital markets fees remained robust, though they were down 8% from a record
level in the fourth quarter with lower M&A advisory fees, partly offset by increased underwriting revenue. Foreign
exchange and interest rate products revenue decreased $7 million linked quarter, given reduced client hedging as
a result of less lending activity and lower volatility.
Expenses on slide 8 were well-controlled, up 3% linked quarter, driven by seasonality in salaries and employee
benefits. We are continuing to focus on both the transformational and business-as-usual aspects of our TOP 6
program, and we are on track to deliver total pre-tax run rate benefit of $400 million to $425 million by the end of
2021. Average loans on slide 9 were broadly stable linked quarter, as Commercial payoffs and slightly lower line
utilization of about 32%, compared with our historical average of roughly 37%, was partially offset by growth in our
education, mortgage and point-of-sale finance portfolios.
Looking at year-over-year trends, average loans were up approximately 1% due to PPP, education and mortgage.
We executed the PPP lending program very smoothly with $1.8 billion of loans secured as part of round two,
taking the total PPP loans to $5.1 billion at period-end. We expect that about 85% of the round one loans will be
forgiven by the end of the year, and for round two, which are five-year loans, about 20% could be forgiven by the
end of 2021 and about 70% forgiven after two years. Overall, the PPP program will help stabilize NII in the first
half of the year, while the benefit will taper off a little in the second half.
On slide 10, deposit flows benefited from the recent consumer-oriented stimulus, especially in low-cost
categories, and our liquidity ratios remain strong. Average deposits were up 1% linked quarter and 16% year-
over-year, as consumers and small businesses benefited from government stimulus and Commercial clients built
liquidity. We are very pleased with our progress on deposit repricing with total deposit costs down 5 basis points
to 14 basis points and interest-bearing deposit costs down 7 basis points to 20 basis points during the quarter.
We continue to drive a shift towards lower cost categories with DDA now about 30% of average deposits
compared with only 23% a year ago. The strength of our deposit franchise is becoming very clear given all the
investments we've made, including the launch of our digital bank, enhanced data analytics, and introducing new
cash management tools for our Commercial clients. At the end of the last low rate cycle in 2015, our interest-
bearing deposit costs bottomed at about 34 basis points. This cycle, we are already at 20 basis points and we
expect these costs to decrease to the low-teens by the end of the year as we execute our deposit playbook.
Moving on to credit on slides 11 and 12, we saw strong credit results this quarter. Net charge-offs were down 9
basis points to 52 basis points linked quarter. This is at the lower end of our guidance for the first quarter and
driven by a reduction in Commercial. First quarter Commercial net charge-offs included charge-offs in areas of
market concern, including CRE retail, casual dining and one large charge-off related to a financial sponsor.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Nonaccrual loans decreased $11 million linked quarter with a $76 million increase (sic) [decrease] in Commercial,
driven by charge-offs, loan sales activity and repayments. Retail nonaccrual loans increased by $65 million linked
quarter, driven by mortgage loans coming off forbearance. However, given the strength of the housing market
with inventories at historical lows and strong LTVs in our book, we expect little to no [ph] loss content in these
(00:12:19) mortgages.
In addition, our Commercial criticized loans continued to trend down this quarter, decreasing by $495 million or
11%. Given the improvement in the macroeconomic outlook and performance of the portfolio, our reserves
decreased, but remained robust, ending the quarter at 2.03% excluding PPP loans compared with 2.24% at the
end of the fourth quarter. This is still significantly higher than our 1.47% day one CECL implementation coverage.
We anticipate there likely will be further reserve releases, assuming the macroeconomic outlook continues to
strengthen and solidify.
We have some detailed credit slides in the appendix for your reference, one on slide 22 covering commercial
credit. Since the start of the COVID-19 crisis, we have been highlighting the commercial areas most impacted by
the lockdown. As we continue to see improvements in the operating environment, these areas of concern have
now decreased to 2.3% of the total CFG loan portfolio, down from 4.6% in 4Q 2020 and approximately 11% in 1Q
2020.
The remaining areas of concern include CRE retail and hospitality, casual dining, and arts, entertainment and
recreation. And accordingly, we are maintaining prudent reserve allocations with a reserve coverage of about
10% for these areas. We maintained excellent balance sheet strength as shown on slide 13, increasing our CET1
ratio from 10% in 4Q to 10.1% at the end of the first quarter, which is slightly above our target operating range
after returning $262 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter.
Before I move on to our 2Q outlook, let me highlight some exciting things that are happening across the company
on slide 14. On the left side of the page, we were very pleased to be able to provide about $1.8 billion in new PPP
loans through the latest SBA program, providing critical funding to over 30,000 of our small business customers.
On the Consumer side, we've recently announced the expansion of our national point-of-sale offering for
merchants through our Citizens Pay offering. We are continuing to add new merchants to our point-of-sale
platform such as BJ's Wholesale Club with more in the pipeline, and the portfolio was up 8% year-over-year.
In addition, we continue to make great strides in our digital transformation with our digital sales up 48% year-over-
year. Clearly, our customers are demanding a different distribution model from us, one that allows for more
efficient digital transactions and an advice-oriented focus in our branches. We've launched our new mobile app on
iOS in January, which is receiving great reviews with an average of 4.6 stars in the App Store.
In Commercial, we have built out a robust corporate finance advisory model, which is supporting our geographic
expansion efforts. Our capital markets business delivered its second best quarter ever in the first quarter,
demonstrating the benefits of the investments we've made over the last few years. On the right side of the page,
you can see a high level view of our strategic priorities, all of which remain on track.
And now for some high-level commentary on the outlook for the second quarter on slide 15, we expect NII to be
up 2% to 2.5%, with NIM up modestly or broadly stable excluding elevated cash. We expect loan growth of 1.5%
to 2% in the second quarter, followed by an acceleration in the back of the year. Earning assets are expected to
be broadly stable in the second quarter. Fee income is expected to be down high single-digits, reflecting lower

mortgage banking fees, as gain on sale margins decline further towards more normal levels, partially offset by
strength across many of the remaining fee categories.
Noninterest expense is expected to be down slightly. We expect net charge-offs will be in the range of 30 to 40
basis points of average loans with a meaningful reserve release through provision. Before I wrap up, I'd like to
provide some comments on this transition period towards economic recovery and our 2021 full-year outlook. First,
we remain confident in our 2021 PPNR outlook with NII higher and fees slightly lower than our original guidance.
Let me give you some further color on the puts and takes. We're expecting loan growth to really pick up in 2H
2021, driven by student, point-of-sale, auto and mortgage, as well as commercial utilization starting to rise from
historical lows as the economy finds stable footing and companies begin to invest for growth. Coupled with a
steeper yield curve, this improves our NII outlook. Our outlook for fees is slightly lower driven by mortgage, as we
expect additional pressure on gain on sale margins as they begin to migrate lower.
As the curve steepens, we should see a transition to greater contributions from purchase originations and
servicing. We have included some additional detail on the mortgage landscape in the appendix on slide 20. We
expect other fee categories namely capital and global markets and wealth to continue to be strong, as we
leverage our investments and the economy rebounds. Other categories like card fees and service charges and
fees should also benefit as consumer confidence and spending picks up.
Given these dynamics, we expect PPNR to bottom in the second quarter and then rebound to levels higher than
the first quarter for the remainder of the year given strength in NII and fees, as well as well-controlled expenses.
We also expect to be close to neutral operating leverage in 2Q compared to 1Q, followed by meaningful positive
operating leverage in the second half. We are also expecting a substantially better credit outlook for the full-year.
Given the strong performance of the loan portfolio and improvement in the macroeconomic forecast, we are
reducing our full-year charge-off guidance range to 35 to 45 basis points. And with this improvement, we could
also see our ACL ratio decline meaningfully from the current 2.03% ex PPP. To wrap up, this was a strong start to
2021 for Citizens as we begin to transition away from the effects of the pandemic to an improving outlook for
interest rates and economic growth, all while staying focused on executing across our strategic initiatives.
With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the Q&A portion of the conference call.
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Your outlook for loan growth is a bit better than what we've heard so far from other folks, and I
was just wondering if you could elaborate on the drivers both in the near-term and then how robust you think loan
growth can be kind of when things fully reopen, call it, later this year or into next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll start off with that, Matt. Others may weigh in here. But in the near-term, I think that the strength that
we're seeing is really attributable to our diversified consumer lending and retail businesses. When you see what
we've been able to do in the mortgage portfolio, auto and education, I think those are areas that have been areas
of strength in the past and will continue to be in the second quarter. I also believe that when we get into the
second quarter, you're going to start to see – although across the industry, we're seeing utilization levels come
down a bit in the first quarter, I think we believe that that'll start to moderate and stabilize and start to head back
up off of historic lows – historic low levels. So, you can see Commercial contributing as well in the second quarter.
And as you – that'll create the staging ground, if you will, for what we see in the second half, where the continuing
expectations for reopening, economic activity accelerating, on the Commercial side inventories building, CapEx
expenditures starting to recover and increase. So, those are the forces that we see in terms of loan growth
throughout the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. On the Consumer side – thanks, John – I'd offer a couple of thoughts. One, across all the asset categories,
we unwound credit tightening that we did through COVID. And so, we haven't changed our risk appetite, but the
temporary tightenings that we did, those are now broadly unwound. So, we should see originations pick up across
all categories. We've also turned on marketing that we had artificially suppressed last year as well. Asset-by-
asset, I think I'd mentioned last quarter we had sort of put auto in a flattish trend intentionally. The market always
allowed for us to grow, but we were optimizing our balance sheet with all the excess deposits we had. Now, on
the short duration, we're finding incredibly high returns in the auto business. So, you should expect that to
continue to moderately grow, assuming that the environment allows for outsized returns, which we're not seeing
slow down.
On the student side, we have a record quarter [ph] in growth in our student loan refinance product at (00:22:09)
over $900 million in originations. That could moderate a tiny bit, but still at record levels giving high rates. And as
the federal portfolio of student loans come off their forbearance in September, that will provide another
opportunity for growth. And then seasonally, in our in-school business, we're expecting a very big year, as a lot of
students took the year off given COVID, a big freshman class coming in, and just seasonal growth in the summer
and the fall. And lastly, point-of-sale is an area that you know we've spent a lot of time and investment in. We've
got great traction. We're up to 15 partners. So, we're in the build phase there, where as these partners ramp,
you're naturally getting sort of outsized growth, sort of law of small numbers, as the portfolio gets to scale. So, I've

got a lot of confidence in the outlook in Consumer growth and underpinning that is obviously improvement in
consumer confidence.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I would just add – it's Bruce, Matt – just one last proof point on the Commercial side. In addition to line utilization,
we're just seeing activity start to build. So, our pipelines are much stronger at this point than they were early in the
first quarter. So, that's a good sign of both economic activity, backlogs in M&A still pretty high. So, we see line
utilization kicking in, plus just the fresh deals, and we continue to add bankers and grow our market share.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And is most of the demand build in Commercial related to deals, as you just referenced, or is there also kind of
some early signs of increased, call it, organic investment among our Commercial borrowers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I think there's some of both, Matt, quite honestly. So, right now, you can see the economic stats are fantastic, and
so people are positioning to try to capture that demand. And so, that means increasing supply, which requires
some capital investment and then also labor, bringing people back to work, which frankly, when we talk to many
of our corporate customers, has been a gating factor. It's hard to actually fill out their needs. And we're trying to
be helpful on that with some initiatives around workforce development. But the animal spirits are starting to kick in
here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thank you.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning. A follow-up to Matt's question, because I want to make sure the market really understands this. A
lot of your larger peers that – where their consumer exposure is more credit card related, really talked to us over
the past couple of days about how deleveraging was going to negatively impact demand. And perhaps maybe
give us a little bit more detail about why your Consumer products are not necessarily going to be impacted the
same as credit card.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Brendan Coughlin A
Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Hey, Erika. Thanks. It's Brendan. I'd just say our credit card book is significantly smaller than our peers on
an average basis to our overall loan book. And so, we are seeing a little bit of those dynamics in our credit card
portfolio. We're not calling for growth in credit card, but that de-levering of our card book with all the extra stimulus
has a much more muted impact for us on our overall consumer lending portfolio than others just given the relative
undersized nature of our card book.
So, we found opportunities to grow in more niche places like point-of-sale, which is – the demand is generated by
purchase activity, and as the economy rebounds, consumer confidence comes back. Folks are out there buying
bigger ticket items again and the point-of-sale business is there to help and very naturally lined up against the
recovery of consumer spending and how we think about modern financing for consumers. And while rates are
going up, they are still very, very low. If I look at student loan refinancing, as I mentioned before, something that's
still going to be very, very strong. There's a lot of customers that are in the money. That's a product that our
peers, generally speaking, don't have. And so, that's generating outsized growth for us.
And similarly in student, the in-school business, as I mentioned before, seasonally just naturally that we're going
to have some growth just by being in that business in the back half of the year, which most of our peers don't
have. In auto, again, not to be too redundant, but we had intentionally sidelined on it. So, we're back in growth
mode there at a moderate level. So, when you add all that up, I think we've got a lot of confidence that we're
going to buck the trends that you're hearing from others, and we're proving it. The numbers show in the last
handful of quarters that we're already delivering even through the COVID period.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I would just add to that. Diversification is important. And so, we have probably more portfolios and some
well-targeted portfolios and niches that should continue to still grow. So, that's I think why we'll kind of buck the
tide a little bit overall. And I would just add also that the outlook for the so-called buy-now-pay-later or installment
financing, kind of tailoring products to people at point-of-sale is very, very positive. I think the industry forecast for
that is 20% growth over the next five years, and on card, it's much, much lower. First, you have to get the
rebound, but then I think the – you're low single-digit in terms of the growth outlook there. So, I think we've made
a bet that this is going to be a burgeoning attractive area, and I think we're well-positioned to catch some wind
here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And my second question is on the margin outlook for the second quarter and perhaps a little bit beyond.
Thank you for giving us an update on how you're expecting PPP to unfold for the rest of the year. I'm wondering in
the NIM up modestly guide, how much forgiveness is assumed for the second quarter? And also maybe give an
outlook on how you're thinking about redeploying the excess cash for the rest of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll go and take that, Erika. I think just to focus on the second quarter, I think that the rate environment is
favorable to us and others. But I think that we're seeing nice tailwinds from the rate long-end rise. I'd also
reference the fact that we added to our hedge portfolio in the first quarter, and that's contributing. And we'll get a

full quarter effect of that in the second quarter, and just our overall mix and – on both the asset and deposit side.
So, greater DDA in the first quarter and that's flowing into the second quarter.
And don't forget some of the comments I made earlier about our deposit costs. That's a lever that continues to
contribute. And those are some of the important, I think, drivers into 2Q with more room to run there, the 20 basis
points coming down to sort of into the teens into the second quarter and to the low-teens as you get to the end of
the year. So, those are some of the forces. PPP is less of a contributor. It's pretty – as we mentioned, it stabilizes
overall NII. But in terms of NIM, there's no real meaningful difference between forgiveness last quarter versus this
quarter or next quarter. So, it's really not a driver over the last quarter or next.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
They are. Rates, balance sheet, balance sheet mix, deposit pricing and loan growth, those are the things that
were really driving us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. And just a further word on PPP. John called it right. But that's been pretty stable through the back half of
last year, through the first half of this year. You look at the yields on those loans with forgiveness baked in, it's not
a big winner for the bank. So, what we had anticipated was that we'd start to see some fall-off given the new
program that was added, the glide path down in the second half of the year is much less severe. So, I don't think
the PPP this year will be a huge factor compared to last year on any sequential quarter that we would have to call
out.

Good morning.

Hi.

Good morning.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Regarding your commentary on the operating leverage expectation for improvement and for – I think you've
referenced it as healthy level of operating leverage. Any way you could help us think about the magnitude in
terms of sizing that up, what type of level of operating leverage you think is achievable in the back half and then
what that could possibly mean for 2022 as you look out?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. So, historically, if you look at what we were able to deliver since the IPO, we've probably been in a 300
basis points of operating leverage type mode. And whether that was 6% or 7% revenue growth and then 3% or
4% expense growth, it's kind of scaled with what the revenue environment is. We tend to compress the expenses
to try to maintain something like that. And so, clearly that would be our objective over time. And as John indicated,
we're kind of working through a transitory phase where the mortgage revenue has to reset. It was a huge boon for
last year. We did 400 basis points of operating leverage for all of last year which was fueled by mortgage.
So, in the first half of the year, as that normalizes, that makes it hard to deliver the positive operating leverage,
although we did state in our guidance that we should come pretty close to neutral in the second quarter,
notwithstanding that kind of last leg to drop on mortgage revenues before it stabilizes. Once we can get back to
kind of having that mortgage bottom out and we're seeing nice growth in our fees, we're seeing our balance sheet
grow, we're seeing good performance on NIM, then we should get back to having a nice top line, and you can
count on us to continue to constrain the expense growth.
We've done, I think, a really good job with the TOP program of repositioning Citizens to be much more equipped
for the future in terms of our technology. So, we have a next-gen technology element to that project. We have
huge – going digital, going to a digital-first business model going to that. So, it does require investment, but our
mindset all along has been to self-fund, to try to find the inefficiencies in how we're running the place, wring those
out, and then in turn go reinvest those. And I think we've demonstrated over time that we're quite good at that. So,
we're managing expense base tightly. But we're certainly keeping up with the investments that we need to
position us for future growth.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Great. Thanks, Bruce. That's helpful. And then separately, on the Consumer side, on the merchant partner side, I
have kind of a two-parter. First, just want to see if you can give us a little bit of color around risk-adjusted returns
you're able to get in that business in terms of maybe the loan yields that you're seeing on your partnership –
partnerships as well as the loss assumptions. And then separately, I know you mentioned buy-now-pay-later,
Bruce. Interested if you – if you believe you need more scale there to take advantage of the opportunity or if you
need more capabilities on the digital front, and therefore, would you be open to an acquisition to give you greater
scale or do you think the momentum you have already in the area is sufficient? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Thanks for that. It's Brendan. I'd say the risk-adjusted returns on the point-of-sale business, the way you
should think about it is it's equivalent to a credit card profile. The geography is a little different. The yields are a
little bit lower and the losses are meaningfully lower. But the returns are equivalent to what you'd expect on a
prime card portfolio, which is why we sort of disclose them all in the same bucket of other retail, so – which is
great, because if you think about that, if you're getting equivalent credit card returns, but lower losses that are
going to perform even better through the cycle, that's a very, very attractive place to play.
And as I've shared in the past, when you look at the credit performance of point-of-sale through COVID,
forbearance was basically nonexistent and delinquencies were down from pre-COVID levels. So, that portfolio
was operating as if there was no recession or lockdown going on around us. And so, we're incredibly excited
about that dynamic and we don't think it was artificially created. The customer experience is so slick and
integrated into consumers top wallet payment that really were kind of getting that top payment position in that
product. So, very, very excited about that.
Relative to acquisition, look, we're really bullish on our capabilities. We think it's very distinctive from what others
offer in this space, the old school traditional buy-now-pay-later players and even relative to some of the fintechs,
where we're – we've got a unique niche, that we also have a balance sheet. We don't have to offload these loans
and it allows for a lot more creativity and innovation on how we structure the product as an example like the Apple
product, where it's a revolving purchase where the customer gets the new phone every year. That's hard to do if
you're reliant on capital markets to fund your business model. So, we're excited about the business model. If there
is an acquisition that could help us accelerate at the right price, of course, we would look at it. But I don't think we
need one to get scale.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
I wanted to ask about the average securities yields. I noticed that it held steady quarter-to-quarter, and I'm just
wondering what the new reinvestment rate is on the securities, and secondly, if you're extending duration on that
portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. And I'll take the last question first. I think the – as you know, most of our portfolio is in the mortgage-backed
security agency space. And so, really that's a rate-driven outcome and pretty typical that as you would see – as
rates rise, prepayments slow. And so, those mortgage-backed will extend in duration. And so, that's really what's
going on there. We didn't actually through our purchase activity endeavor to extend the duration. That was just an
impact of the macro on the securities that we have. I think the way that we look at the securities book, it's
basically – a few weeks ago, I might have said that our reinvestment yields could have been in the neighborhood
of 1.75% to 1.80% and might have been close to where the run-off yields would be.
But over the last couple of weeks, as you've seen the rally in rates, we're sort of in the, I'll call it, 1.60% range.
And so, it'll be a negative front-book, back-book probably in the early part of the second quarter. But as you get
into the end of the third quarter based upon what we see, you can start to see securities portfolio being the first
sort of term book that starts to get to neutral on front-book, back-book and begins to become a positive contributor
into the second half. And I'd say more broadly, those are the kind of – that's the kind of dynamic you'll see with
other bond categories as one by one you'll see improvements on that front. The other thing, again, back to this is
a broader NII, NIM story. But if we believe where rates are headed and the forces all indicate that we'll get to
higher long-term rates as you get to the end of the year, we'll continue to layer in our swaps and our swap
hedging program as well, which will also contribute to NII and [ph] NIM (00:38:43).

Bruce Winfield Van Saun A

John F. Woods A

So, the front-book, back-book converts from a headwind to sort of a tailwind as you get to the – into the second
half, and then you can see our playbook on rate management all contributing to NII and NIM.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Got it. Thank you. And then, just on the allowance for credit losses, I'm just wondering with the improvement in
credit, how quickly do you think you can get back to that CECL day one level? And does that level change just
because the composition of the portfolio changing with more of the growth – or more growth from Consumer?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I'll go ahead and take that. You've seen us come down relatively meaningfully this quarter. The way CECL
works, if you had perfect knowledge about where the macro is headed, all of that good news and all of that
expected outcome would all be built into our results this quarter. But you also have to take into consideration the
uncertainty around those expectations. And the uncertainty, as we're turning towards much more positive macro,
that uncertainty in the range of potential outcomes is still very, very wide. And as a result, we have a number of
overlays that are judgmental in nature that sort of work together with our model outputs to give you what our
results are. So, net-net, the balance would be that we have big releases happening now. If in fact the uncertainty
around the base case begins to narrow, you could see our coverage getting closer to day one as you get into the
second half and towards the end of the year.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I guess the first question just in terms of the swaps that you put on, can you just talk about the duration of those? I
understand we're sort of in a low rate environment. But at some point, rates will rise. I'm just kind of curious how
the timing of those swaps play out with your expectations for the Fed fund hikes at some point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. The duration is five years on the swaps that we put on with the $7 billion, and that's relatively typical. You
sort of look at this on a dollar cost averaging basis. When you see the five-year is really where a lot of this
hedging happens. When you saw the five-year go from 40 basis points to 90 basis points in a very short period of
time, that's a signal to trigger the first sort of tranche of hedging that you will do over time. And really we're not –
what you're doing is, is you are reducing your downside when you start to layer hedges in. And so, our first
tranche was triggered. It's contributing in a positive way. It takes away and reduces the risk to lower rates over
time. But we basically – you pause after that first sort of category of hedging and you wait for the next sort of
range of rates before you get into the next tranche. And so, $7 billion is a fraction of what our overall hedging will

be as you get to the end of the cycle. And so, rather than waiting to pick the perfect spot maybe a year from now
and do all of our hedging all at once, you tend to do it over time. So...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Just leg into it, it came to dollar cost averaging.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Absolutely.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
And the last – so, the last tranche that you would do, if and when the five-year hits its peak, and then if you have a
big rally in rates, those – that will widen out the first tranche that you do as you get towards the end of the five
years. If in fact rates continue to rise and rise and rise, then you have – those turn negative. But those are more
than offset by all of the positives of the hedging that you do as rates continue to rise.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
That makes perfect sense. And then, just my second question, in terms of capital, obviously a very strong CET1
at 10.1%. Can you just talk about your plans or expectations, like how does that eventually get absorbed? Now,
you can't buy back stock, but it sounds a lot like you're also going to have stronger balance sheet growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. I think we've said this before. Our program here and our number one capital objectives are to support the
dividend and to support organic growth and putting capital to work in support of our customers and clients. So,
that's really our first objective. And if we can do that in a way that is additive and returns exceed our cost of
capital, we think that's the right thing to do for the franchise. And so, that's our focus. As we mentioned earlier, we
do have a transition to loan growth beginning in the second quarter, the average loan growth 1.5% to 2%. But
spot loan growth in the second quarter will be higher than that. As things begin to accelerate, you could see 3% or
better spot growth in the second quarter alone and seeing those numbers go higher still if the environment unfolds
the way we expect. So, that's our focus. To the extent that we have excess capital even after supporting all of
those things, then that's when you get into how we look at returning it to shareholders through the form of
buybacks and thinking in parallel about bolt-on fee acquisitions.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I think the first question is sort of a follow-up on the capital one from the prior question. Just given that the credit
concerns are kind of melting away, is there any opportunity to maybe revisit your internal capital targets a little
lower or a little higher than some of your peers? And of course, some of that I'm sure is just due to the complexion
of the balance sheet. But nonetheless, with the risk profile improvement, I just would be curious to hear any
thoughts there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. It's Bruce. So, we, as you're aware, have inched down over time. So, I think initially, we had a 10.25%
target as our CET1 ratio, and then we went to 10% to 10.25%. And now, we're 9.75% to 10%. So, I think initially
coming out of the IPO as a relatively new company without a long-term track record, having a little higher CET1
targets than peers made sense. You've seen through the CCAR work at our credit losses stress at median or
better – slightly better than median. And so, there's really not such a significant need any longer to carry that little
extra cushion, although I do like to sleep well at night. And so, I think a strong capital ratio helps with that.
But over time, we'll see where the peer group goes, and if the peer group continues to inch down, given a positive
outlook for the foreseeable future, there's no reason that we couldn't do that as well. But at this point, we're locked
in for this year with that 9.75% to 10% range. And I think that gives us plenty of firepower given the capital we're
generating, potential for future reserve releases, to pursue our agenda of the significant loan growth and
potentially some fee-based acquisitions and also giving some back to our shareholders.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Perfect. All right, thank you. And then maybe, John, just sort of a follow-up on some of the actions you took
regarding rate sensitivity in the first quarter. I think I can sort of back into some of it based on kind of what you
said about duration and things like that. But I think you guys have said in the past your rate sensitivity is sort of
55/45 short-end versus long-end. Is there any meaningful change in how that looks now following some of those
first quarter actions?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Not much of a difference. I'd maybe call it 60/40. But basically, that's about where we are 60% short, 40%
long in terms of the complexion.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Hi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Amanda Larsen Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
I guess on the loan growth outlook for 1.5% to 2%, you did talk about the buckets. But if you can kind of just talk
about the mix that you would expect of just Commercial versus Consumer in 2Q, that would be helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. And I think that – retail, I would describe it as, is really going to be leading the way in the second quarter as
Commercial takes maybe – begins its march and as the recovery really contributes to higher utilization and as
those loan pipelines that you heard from Bruce earlier begin to sort of realize themselves. So, I'd say in the
second quarter, it's probably, I don't know, something in the neighborhood of two-thirds, one-third with the
majority coming from retail, but Commercial clearly contributing and beginning to be a bigger contributor as you
get into the second half of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I think you've got some – for average loan purposes, you've got to work through some of the dynamics in the first
quarter. But what we're pretty excited about is on a spot basis, we see significant growth in the second quarter,
which will set us up well for growth in the second half of the year. So, the goal really in the second quarter is to
really layer in that nice spot level of growth that won't fully manifest itself in the average numbers. So, therefore,
we're at the 1.5% to 2%. But it does, if we achieve it, set us up extremely well for the third quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Amanda Larsen Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay, super. And then, John, can you just explain the conversation on swaps with how much you earned on cash

here?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. The way that we've talked about that in the past is really on a year-over-year basis given that the portfolio is
contractual and you can sort of see it. We've talked last year, based upon the portfolio that was in place at the
time, that year – from 2021 would be about a, call it, $75 million to $80 million decline in contribution from the
swap portfolio versus 2020. Just with the $7 billion that we put on in the first quarter, that's been cut in half. And
so, the headwind from swaps is really declining. If rates continue to rise from here, that number will continue to
decline off of that level.
I think the broader point though is you can't really look at it in isolation. You got to look at overall. As we indicated,
net interest margin being broadly stable excluding excess cash and frankly rising if you consider what's going on
with deployment of cash and what's happening with our expectations on loan growth. And another reminder on
our deposit costs, that's a lever that's unique to us. We may have come down a little slower than others, because
we had a lot farther to come. And so, 20 basis points headed to. call it, mid-teens in the second quarter, headed
to low-teens to the end of the year, that's another driver. So, the big picture including all of the swap dynamics,
net interest margin appears to be stabilizing and is an improving picture going forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
It's funny that what was a gap versus peers with slightly higher deposit costs turns into a lever, turns into an asset
when you're going through this environment. So, many of the peers have already reached levels that it's hard to
improve upon on their interest-bearing deposit costs where we still have some room to run.

Bill Carcache Q

Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on some of your earlier comments. You guys have a unique view
given your mix of Consumer versus Commercial lending. Can you give a bit more color on how you see pent-up
demand dynamics playing out across both groups as we make further progress into the reopening? It sounds like
you think there will be a bit more gearing initially on the Consumer versus Commercial side. But I was hoping you
could just expand on that thought process. And how does the excess liquidity that both groups have available play
into that thinking?

Yeah. I can start. Yeah, on the Consumer side, I think the growth that we're projecting is sort of happening
underlying right now, and we'll get a bit of a tailwind from the reopening and consumer confidence growing. But

the structure of our products are so diversified and naturally set up to give us outsized growth. I'd mentioned
earlier student loan refinancing. You should think about that a lot like mortgage. When rates are low and even
though they're ticking up a little bit, they're still historically low, that creates a boom of demand. It's almost like
stimulus, another form of stimulus for customers that we're providing through restructuring their payments down.
And so, that just is naturally demanded now independent of reopening.
Similarly, with point-of-sale, I mentioned as the economy reopens, customers are starting to do big ticket
purchases again. We're seeing our debit transaction average ticket go up pretty significantly. Those transactions
are now up year-over-year. It's very clear consumers are starting to spend again, which means point-of-sale
opening seems well-positioned for growth with the economy reopening. We're seeing that anyway even
independent of another tick-up of the economy reopening.
And auto has been a hot market. The auto industry sales are really, really high and the market is still bearing
outsized returns. And so, [indiscernible] (00:53:26) we're going to continue. We got a diversified auto business,
number one J.D. Power in the country in auto. We're very well-positioned to grow that business in a well-
controlled way with double-digit ROEs, which you don't typically see with auto. So, yeah, I think as the economy
reopens, that should provide a bit of another nudge and a tailwind. But even at a moderately slow pace of the
economy reopening, I still feel pretty good given the diversification of our business that we'll get the growth that
we're calling for in Consumer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. And I would say we still would expect to see some elevated cash levels. And a lot of times, that's kind of
geared to folks who worked in the service industries and had lots of employment and are still kind of holding on to
precautionary cash levels given the circumstances. So, that will, I think, run down fairly gradually. But these other
factors that Brendan mentioned are somewhat separate from that. They're not as impacted by kind of the stimulus
money that's been paid out.
And then, I think on the Commercial side, it's really just a question of how fast folks take a positive view about the
need-to-meet demand. If they see demand rising, then they can start investing. And then, how do they finance
that? They can use some of the big liquidity levels that they were able to amass. But I think you'll see that
corporate cash start to drop some, but then going back and borrowing on lines is kind of the next phase that you
would expect to see and then some special purpose facilities to build a new plant or things like that or just the
deals that continue to happen and the financing that goes with those acquisitions. So, we would expect to see –
we're already starting to see that some of that cash is getting put to work and it really just depends on how fast
the view about the economic improvement solidifies.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC
That's helpful. Thank you. If I could follow up, do you think that the elevated payment rates that we've been
seeing really on the Consumer side broadly have peaked based on what you guys are seeing or – particularly
with the effects of the latest stimulus checks or could those potentially remain elevated for a bit longer here before
we start to see them come down and I guess contribute a bit more to some of that improvement in balances that
you're expecting?

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Yeah. So, the elevated stimulus on prepayment rates is mostly felt on credit card, which we are – in our guidance
still calling for credit card to shrink slightly, healthy purchase activity, but there's a lot of cash out in the
environment, as you point out. Some of the prepay rates that we're seeing on other products are not necessarily
stimulus-driven like mortgage with a lot of churn and refinancing. We're originating, taking share, but – the
portfolio is growing, but there's a lot of underlying [ph] prepayments (00:56:34). But that will start to slow as
interest rates go up moderately, although we still think volume and demand is going to be very, very heavy. But
it's going to turn towards purchase versus refi. So, we should see a natural slowing of prepay on the mortgage
portfolio.
I'd also say on home equity, we don't talk about that very often. It's a very big business for us and it's been slowly
shrinking and shrinking faster in the industry. You got a lot of the big banks that are sitting on the sidelines at the
moment that have really curtailed or even shut down their home equity originations platforms. So, we're enjoying
market share that's almost double what we naturally get, which we'd naturally get really high market share in this
industry. So, I expect us to, at a minimum, be a slower decline than others on home equity for prepay speeds
given the size and pace of our originations capacity. And there's some optimism potentially that we could start to
see home equity flatten and not be a headwind anymore for us. So, there's a lot of dynamics, I think, at play there.
But really your question around stimulus will be most felt in credit card and that is called for in our underlying
guidance and more than offset by those other dynamics.

Understood. That's very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.

Go ahead.

Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Sorry about that. I was on mute. Thanks for taking my question. You've indicated that most of the expected
decline in noninterest income is coming from lower mortgage banking fees, but that it should sort of hit a floor in
the second quarter. I guess I just want to understand the logic there a little bit better. What gives you confidence
that we will see a floor and we'll start to see it in 2Q and we won't see further compression in margins beyond that
that pressures the overall fee line?
And then secondly, I'll just ask my second question now. On the swaps, what receive rate are you getting on
those, because I guess I understand the logic of averaging in and legging into it? But maybe the – I guess the flip
side of that is it does seem a little bit out of step on the surface to me with the view that you expect rates to
continue to rise, where it seems like maybe you can argue that it's a bit premature to leg into it already. So, if you
can just flesh that out for us a little bit.

Q1 2021 Earnings Call 16-Apr-2021
Sure. On mortgage, what we've seen happen kind of starting in late third quarter, into the fourth quarter was the
industry gearing up in terms of capacity, adding capacity to really capture the whole refi opportunity, and that –
and then, you had some of these big non-bank players going public and being pretty aggressive around market
share. So, the very high gain on sale margins that were kind of frankly amazing and unsustainable back in Q3
have started to normalize back to historical levels based on those factors – those forces. And so, we kind of see
that playing out through the second quarter and then restoring – kind of getting restored to levels that we've seen
historically. And the current view is unlikely to go meaningfully below that. So, that's the assumption that we're
making.
The flip side to that is that there's also a strong outlook for originations. We're looking at over $3 trillion which
should be, next to 2020, another record year in terms of originations. And we're probably seeing a shift from refi to
a little bit more purchase in the mix, and we're very well-positioned in our retail channel to capture that. So, still
looking at a strong level of origination. So, there's really no headwinds there at all. And then, the size of our
servicing book and the MSR asset, all of that should offer somewhat of an offset to the fall in margins. So, we'll
see. I think we've been pretty good at forecasting these dynamics. But the market is the market. We'll see how it
plays out. But I think we've thought pretty hard about the factors and tried to project those out. And so, we feel
pretty confident that that's the likely scenario for Q2 and then for the rest of the year. So, I'll stop there unless you
want to add anything, Brendan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
I think it's well-said. The one maybe data point I would add to that just to kind of accentuate the rebound in
purchase offsetting some of the refi decline is that over the last 45 days, we've seen about a 30% growth rate in
purchase volume coming through our retail channel. So, it's not just hopes and dreams. We're seeing an actual
and real momentum through the business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendan Coughlin A
Head-Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
So, we feel pretty good about the volume outlook to Bruce's point. The margins bottoming at 2019 level is really
the key assumption, that it doesn't go any deeper than historical levels, and we're seeing it starting to stabilize
right now, so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah, good. So, we'll flip the second question over to John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. Thanks. So, Saul, I think the point here is we saw a pretty rapid rise in the five-year over the last several
months. As I mentioned, I think at the end of last year, it was around 40 basis points. It had gotten, I think, frankly
north of 90 basis points. But I think it's settling in around 80 basis points right now. That is really emblematic of the
first sort of risk triggers that we think about. And basically, this is an interest rate risk hedging program, and that

hedging program really requires us to consider where our asset sensitivity is and what the downside exposures
are.
And so, from that perspective, we have several sort of triggers and tranches of hedging that we'll do over time.
This is the first one, and I think there would be another one as and if rates continue to rise, although it's our
expectation that rates will continue to rise. The last sort of couple of weeks is a reminder that things can deviate
from your base case. And so, we're just being prudent risk managers and taking our asset sensitivity from around
11% to something that's in the very high single-digits. And as we get to the top of the rate cycle, we'll get back
down to something that's in the lower single-digits similar to where we've been in the past. And that's a very
prudent sort of approach versus waiting around for the perfect time to begin to hedge.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John F. Woods A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
Yeah. The other question you asked was what the receive rate was. During that range of 40 to 80 basis points in
the five-year, we did most of the hedging towards the upper end of that range. But that will give you the answer
there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce Winfield Van Saun A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)
