Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As you all know, over the past decade, we've dramatically
transformed our business model. We've grown the contribution of more durable, balance sheet-light sources of
revenue, investing in Wealth Management and Investment Management, while maintaining our leadership
position and taking share across our integrated investment bank. The intention has been to provide stability to our
firm in times of serious stress and to provide strength and value to our clients in times of volatile and active
markets.
The environment for the second quarter provided exactly that test, the COVID health crisis, economic collapse
and a tremendous surge in unemployment, massive fiscal and monetary stimulus, operating with 90% of
employees working from home, extraordinary client financing demand, an increase in corporate defaults and

bankruptcies, and record market volumes. Against this extremely challenging backdrop, I'm very proud of my
colleagues, the way they managed to support our clients and risk manage massive uncertainty, all while working
from home.
The results we announced this morning build on a very strong relative performance of the first quarter with a
record-breaking second quarter. Revenues of $13.4 billion exceeded our best quarter ever by 21%. We delivered
record net income of $3.3 billion and an ROTCE of 18.6% excluding a discrete tax item, with an expense
efficiency ratio of 68%. The stability of our platform in the face of record-breaking volumes and a surge in capital-
raising from clients was critical.
Our revenues, of course, benefited from this record activity. But the ROTCE is a function of very strong operating
leverage with a high degree of expense discipline in the face of significant macro headwinds. As importantly, our
credit costs were relatively limited. This is by design, as we have virtually no unsecured consumer loans, we do
not have significant emerging market exposure, and we have modest exposure to the small business segment.
Each of our businesses contributed meaningfully to the results, but the standout was Institutional Securities. For
the post-crisis period, ISG had record revenues of $8 billion and record equity underwriting, record debt
underwriting, record equity sales and trading, and record Fixed Income sales and trading. Fixed Income in
particular was the standout. In Wealth Management, despite the impact of rates on net interest income and some
integration costs relating to E*TRADE, our margin was over 24%. We saw clients continue to consolidate assets
with our advisors, deposit growth and loan growth.
Investment Management also performed exceptionally well with record and industry-leading long-term flows, as
well as growth across all asset classes, geographies and investor segments. Assets now are $665 billion, up from
approximately $460 billion at the beginning of 2019. So, what does the future hold? Clearly, it will be challenging
for the back half of 2020 to meet the record first half results, and we expect advisory and macro trading to be
significantly lower. That said, many parts of our business should continue to perform well.
Let me touch on the CCAR exam and our SCB results. This year, the new SCB results confirmed what we have
believed for many years that we carry significant excess capital. We still believe that our PPNR is understated and
we will continue to work with the regulators to better calibrate the models to the realities of our business.
Our excess capital position allows us significant flexibility to continue to support our clients, invest in our business,
grow our balance sheet and continue to pursue inorganic opportunities in our target areas. In the near-term, we
remain committed to our quarterly dividend of $0.35. Over time, we expect to reinstate our buyback and increase
our dividend, subject of course to regulatory approvals.
Let's turn to E*TRADE. I remain as confident, if not more so, about the strategic benefit to Morgan Stanley from
this transaction. Among many positives it delivers, it gives us strong digital capabilities, a platform for international
expansion, a world-class workplace business, and will further enhance our CET1 ratio.
Before turning to Jon, let me touch on the recent events affecting the black community, particularly in this country,
but also in many places around the world. It is clear that the racial injustice that has existed in our society for a
very long time has not been resolved. We at Morgan Stanley want to be part of the solution.
As part of our continuing efforts in this area, we've recently added a commitment to diversity and inclusion as our
fifth core value and made a number of other structural and financial decisions to materially enhance the
opportunities provided to our diverse employees. We will be doing more in the coming quarters to ensure that our

employee population mirrors the broader society in which we operate and live in, and we'll provide detail around
our recently announced Institute of Inclusion.
So, let me now turn the call over to Jon, who will discuss the results of the quarter in greater detail. Thank you.

Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Thank you and good morning. In the second quarter, firm net revenues were $13.4 billion with net income
applicable to Morgan Stanley of $3.2 billion. The quarter included an intermittent net discrete tax expense of $134
million, which impacted EPS by $0.08. Excluding this item, net income was $3.3 billion and EPS was $2.04. Also
excluding this item, our ROE and ROTCE were 16.4% and 18.6% respectively, and our year-to-date basis
ROTCE was 14.2%.
As part of our decade-long business transformation, we have taken a highly integrated approach to client
coverage. Our business segments and divisions work together to deliver a wide range of solutions and the firm's
intellectual capital to our clients. This long-term coordinated approach has allowed us to provide a deeper level of
service and stronger partnerships with our clients and has positioned us for our results this year. Throughout, we
remain disciplined around our expenses, working diligently to manage down our efficiency ratio and our fixed cost
base.
This quarter illustrates the significant operating leverage in the model, especially in Institutional Securities.
Quarter-over-quarter, ISG revenues was up over $3 billion, while non-compensation expenses were down over
$100 million. Our firm efficiency ratio was 68% in the quarter. High levels of client activity led to elevated
transaction-related expenses, which were offset by a dramatic reduction in marketing and business development
and continued discipline around professional services costs.
We continue to support our employees and communities through these challenging times through financial,
equipment, medical and other means of support. We remain focused on opportunities to work smarter and more
efficiently. We have learned a lot about our organization and its cost structure through this period, and we will
leverage that learning to continue to optimize how and where we work and how we use our technology.
Now, to the businesses. Institutional Securities reported revenues of $8 billion, a post-financial crisis record and
nearly $2 billion higher than the prior best quarter. Record results were realized across various businesses,
products and regions. Our integrated investment bank benefited from our coordinated and client-focused
approach. We saw significant demand for our leading research and bankers to help clients navigate these
uncertain markets.
Corporate clients took the opportunity to raise capital and liquidity, and sales and trading investors actively
repositioned their portfolios given the rapidly changing environment. Robust underwriting volumes also
contributed to increased levels of sales and trading activities. Investment Banking generated revenues of $2.1
billion, increasing 79% from the prior quarter. Underwriting drove the results, delivering its strongest performance
in over a decade. From a geographical perspective, all regions saw a sequential improvement with particularly
strong results in the Americas.
Advisory revenues increased 28% from last quarter to $462 million, benefiting from higher completed M&A
industry volumes, driven by an increase in larger transactions. Year-to-date, announced industry volumes are
down over 40% and we expect M&A to remain muted until there is more clarity on the path of the recovery and

stability in prices. However, CEOs and boards are engaged and strategic dialogue is integrated into our client
discussions.
Equity underwriting revenues more than doubled versus the prior quarter to $882 million, driven by increases
across products, follow-ons, converts, blocks and IPOs. Issuance accelerated in the latter two months of the
quarter. Global equity volumes were the highest in nearly a decade, as clients bolstered their balance sheets and
monetized equity stakes. The quarter saw a record convertible issuance, as near zero interest rates and elevated
volatility led issuers to favor equity-linked instruments.
Fixed income underwriting revenues were $707 million, up 59% from the prior quarter, driven by bond issuance.
Global high-yield new issue volumes in June represented the highest ever recorded. Investment grade market
also saw record issuance volumes. Activity has been driven by a combination of companies looking to fortify their
balance sheets and others taking advantage of the very constructive financing environment.
After unprecedented levels of capital-raising, issuance levels are likely to slow from the current torrid pace as we
enter the summer. Pipelines remain healthy, particularly IPOs, and if markets remain constructive, we would
expect active issuance in the latter part of this year.
Equity sales and trading revenues increased 8% sequentially to $2.6 billion. Strong performance in cash and
derivatives as well as a rebound in prime brokerage balances contributed to results. Cash and derivative
revenues were the highest in over a decade, driven by strong trading results across regions, as we continued to
help our clients navigate through this period of unprecedented uncertainty. In cash, in the face of historic volumes,
we executed for clients and helped keep markets open and functioning. And in derivatives, the results were strong
across product types.
Prime brokerage results were resilient and in line with the prior quarter. Balances rose significantly from March
lows, as market levels trended up and certain clients re-levered, although second quarter average balances were
about 15% below the first quarter. Fixed income sales and trading had its best quarter in over 10 years, excluding
the impact of DVA, with robust performance across all major businesses and geographies. Revenues of $3 billion
increased 38% from the strong first quarter. Results were particularly high in April, as macro benefited from
elevated volatility and wider bid-offer spreads and credit markets retraced much of their first quarter movements.
Clients were especially active in the beginning of the quarter and remained engaged throughout, though market
spreads normalized and volatility abated. We continue to see improvement in client penetration as we gain
mindshare, especially amongst leading asset managers. Micro revenues increased significantly, driven by
securitized products and credit corporates. Macro performance was strong across products, though declined
versus the robust prior quarter. Commodity results also remained strong, benefiting from continued elevated
levels of market volatility in oil and metals.
Across other sales and trading and other revenues, results improved dramatically from the first quarter. The three
main drivers across these lines include investments associated with deferred cash-based compensation, or DCP,
performance of our $41 billion held for sale portfolio, and our provision for credit losses for our $43 billion held for
investment loans. The sum of these components was approximately $200 million this quarter versus a negative
$1.1 billion in the first quarter. Spreads tightened throughout the quarter, leading to approximately a $250 million
gain on mark-to-market of our held for sale portfolio, net of losses on our hedges.
Our provision for loan losses was $223 million, down from $273 million in the first quarter, and DCP swung
positive this quarter as markets recovered. Our ISG loans declined by approximately $11 billion from the prior
5

quarter, driven primarily by pay-downs in our corporate and event book, as clients took advantage of open and
active capital markets to replace short-term funding with longer term capital. Our funded ratio of corporate loans
peaked at over 25% of commitments in 1Q and now stands at 18%.
Our allowance for credit losses on loans increased to $756 million, which represents a 43% build in our allowance
over the quarter. Our loan book continues to perform well and we had no charge-offs in the quarter. Currently,
we've approved less than $1 billion of requests for principal and interest forbearance across ISG loans.
As you can see in our new disclosure on page 11 of the financial supplement, our allowance for corporate loans
increased to 3.8% and our allowance for commercial real estate increased to 3.1%. Across the entire held for
investment portfolio, our total allowance rose to 1.8%.
Now, turning to Wealth Management, second quarter revenues were $4.7 billion. DCP losses of approximately
$425 million from first quarter reversed almost entirely and prepayment amortization declined. These factors
drove the sequential increase in revenues. Pre-tax profits was $1.1 billion and pre-tax profit margin was 24.4%.
The underlying growth drivers remain strong. On the heels of the technology and risk management of investments
we have made, client asset consolidation continues. We increased retail asset capture and retention and lending
penetration with our existing clients. Additionally, net recruiting has materially improved.
Transactional revenues were $1.1 billion. After excluding the impact of DCP, transactional revenue was down
versus the prior period, reflecting a decline in client activity from the extremely high levels of the first quarter.
Asset management revenues were $2.5 billion, down 6% sequentially. Lower starting asset levels drove this
decline. Lending growth in the first half of the year has been strong at over $5 billion with balances of $85 billion,
up 15% versus the prior year, driven by securities based lending and mortgages.
The loan portfolio continues to perform extremely well. We saw mortgage forbearance remain stable at
approximately 2% of the portfolio and our 90-day delinquencies are at 24 basis points. We've granted
approximately $1 billion of forbearance on commercial real estate loans in our Tailored Lending book, each of
which has personal guarantees from ultra-high net worth clients. We had less than 1 basis point of net charge-offs
in our Wealth lending book year-to-date and provision for loan losses of $23 million was in line with last quarter.
Net interest income was $1 billion. Excluding the impact of prepayment amortization, NII was relatively flat
compared to prior quarter and exceeded our expectations. The impact of lower rates was offset by elevated
LIBOR levels and spreads at the beginning of the quarter and higher lending and BDP balances. We expect to
see NII drift lower for the remainder of the year, as LIBOR and spreads have normalized. Growth in our lending
businesses and higher levels of stable bank deposits should continue to offset some of the pressure from lower
interest rates.
Total U.S. Bank deposits were $236 billion. The meaningful increase in bank deposits that we saw in the first
quarter was sustained and we continue to see BDP balances grow. Clients remain cautious as cash and short-
term securities levels remain over 20% of total assets. We expect to see an outflow for delayed tax payments.
Total expenses were $3.5 billion, up 19% sequentially. The increase was driven by higher comp expenses,
principally related to DCP. The Solium integration and execution of our Morgan Stanley at Work strategy are on
track and are important precursors to our integration of E*TRADE.
We continue to add new corporate clients, approximately 180 this year and 525 since the announcement of the
Solium acquisition. We continue to prepare for the expected closing of the E*TRADE deal in the fourth quarter
and have started to incur expenses in advance of the closing. Excluding these integration and acquisition-related
6

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2020
costs in the second quarter, the margin would have been over 25%. These integration and acquisition-related
expenses will likely erode the margin by 50 to 100 basis points this quarter as well. After we close E*TRADE,
these integration costs will be more substantial and we will provide further breakout at that time.
Investment Management revenues increased 28% to $886 million, representing the second highest quarterly level
in over a decade. Total AUM rose 14% to a record high $665 billion, of which long-term AUM was $397 billion.
Long-term net flows were also a record at $15.4 billion across strategies from a broad base set of global
investors. This equates to an annualized rate of 18%. Total net flows were $36 billion. Strong fund performance,
our deep global client partnerships and the power of our brand have driven this industry-leading flow growth.
Our clients are entrusting us with their assets. We continue to deliver differentiated value to our clients across
both public and private markets, as well as through our global solutions capabilities. Our global active equity
strategies continued to deliver significant outperformance and are attracting robust flows from institutions and
wealth management clients both internationally and from the United States.
Liquidity inflows remain strong with positive flows across strategies. Asset management fees of $684 million
increased 3% sequentially, driven by higher management fees on higher average AUM. Investment revenues
were $230 million in the quarter. The sequential increase was supported by the rebound in global markets. We
continue to invest in the Investment Management business and to focus and execute on multiple organic and
inorganic growth opportunities to meet client needs.
Turning to the balance sheet, total spot assets rose to $975 billion, in line with the recovery in equity markets and
high levels of client activity. Standardized RWAs were flat at $416 billion, as an increase in market risk assets was
offset by a decline in credit risk assets. Our standardized CET1 ratio rose 80 basis points to 16.5% compared to
our recently announced SCB of 13.4%. Our board declared a $0.35 dividend per share. Our tax rate was 22.6%
for the quarter excluding $134 million of intermittent net discrete tax expense. We continue to expect our full-year
2020 core tax rate will be approximately 22% to 23%.
The second quarter illustrates that our strategy is working and highlights the power of our differentiated model.
We were at the forefront of serving our clients when they needed us most. As for the operating outlook, the
dispersion of potential macro outcomes is high. The path forward will largely be determined by the course of the
COVID pandemic, the shape of the economic recovery and potential additional fiscal stimulus. We continue to see
reasonable client activity in the first few weeks of the quarter, but would expect a reversion to more normalized
levels as we head deeper into the summer.
Aspects of the capital markets business will likely normalize and a rebound in M&A activity will take some time. In
Wealth, we would expect to see continued momentum around new assets, new clients and lending growth, as we
become a destination of choice for financial advisors. In Investment Management, our record flows will support
fee growth and investment returns will depend on the macro environment. We will continue to focus on what we
can control, serving our clients, managing risk and controlling our expenses.
With that, we will now open the line to questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your
line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. And just a quick note that – like the DFAST results, recent results
certainly reflect the improvements and the resilience that you guys have made in the model, and that must be a
nice affirmation for all the hard work you've been putting in. So, congrats on that. When we think about the Wealth
Management business and the pre-tax margin, how should we think about – is it just backing out the $425 million
DCP from both revenue and comp and would that result then in the sort of core pre-tax margin being
demonstrably higher? And is it fair to say that just maybe the headwinds from the environment were not quite as
profound as you anticipated and profitability in this business is going to be better as far as the outlook or is it not
that simple?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
It's sort of that simple. Firstly, thank you for your kind comments. To address the broader – with the DFAST, SCB
numbers and these results and the upcoming closing on E*TRADE, assuming the shareholder vote happens,
which is imminent, which I expect it will, I clearly feel that we are at a different inflection point that we've been
building towards for many years. So, these results affirm that, and I'm sure we'll talk more about it. On Wealth
Management, you can do – Brennan, obviously, you can do the math on the DCP, which basically nets revenue
against comp expense.
The Wealth Management margins, the material change in those margins was the net interest income, the change
in rates. And as we move to zero rates now, you can have a view rates will be permanently zero, in which case
we'll have to do other things to enhance that business. By the way, E*TRADE operates with margins around 40%
– 45% at the moment. So, with some of the restructuring that we'll be doing, putting those two businesses
together, there clearly is margin enhancement opportunity just from that trade alone. But in the last few months,
we had low market prices at the points where we price the fee income. That's obviously improved.
We had a little bit of a rush of activity, but we had not nearly as much, because our clients are very stable and
very fee-based. So, in the Wealth business, what I look at is the fundamentals. Assets are growing. Flows are
growing. Fee-based flows are growing. Loan book is growing. Deposits are growing. Advisor attrition is basically
zero. We're attracting net advisors. We're consolidating E*TRADE. We're opening up some international growth
platforms. We've got a lot of opportunity to make the business more efficient and more technology-driven, and
interest rates will look after themselves at some point. So, I remain extremely optimistic about the business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay, great. Thank you for that. I appreciate that, James. And following up on that, when we think about NII, Jon,
I think you had said you expect it to drift lower. But is it that the impact turned out to be a little bit more muted than
you all expected and this is the right jumping-off point with a more modest headwind from here? Or is there – was
there some one-time noise in the quarter around NII within the Wealth business?

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2020
Jonathan Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
No. I think it's – as I said in my prepared remarks, Brennan, the performance is better than we expected. If you
recall, in the first quarter, we thought that the impact of all the rate cuts – we sort of tried to size that for you, and
it's performed better. The primary drivers are, as I said, the elevated LIBOR. Now, that's normalized. And so,
that's why I'm suggesting that the NII is going to drift lower. I think the first two quarters, if you eliminate the
prepayments, have been pretty neutral and stable in terms of NII. And that normalization is going to cause the
drifting down slightly of the NII going forward, and then it should be stabilized. What we are seeing is that some of
that loss that we expected, we picked up in terms of just the balances, both the lending balances and the excess
deposit balances have abated some of those headwinds. So, it's better than we expected, but still clearly
impacted by the zero rate environment.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
And just to build on that, we can't control the NII, obviously, very little, given where rates are. But what we did see
and what I saw in the last financial crisis, those institutions that are strong and stable attract flows
disproportionately. In the last crisis, we were obviously not that institution, and we were in fact losing flows, not
dramatically, but we certainly weren't adding and we were losing a little bit on the margin. This crisis, the reverse
is happening. We're attracting positive flows and significant and positive FA talent, and that's just a function of
strength and stability. So, I think that behooves very well for the future of that particular business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Thank you. So, I heard you loud and clear on the first couple of weeks, reasonable activity, and expect the
summer to settle in. I do think we're still at a volatility level that's almost double like last year. So, it might settle in
at a higher level. I'm not asking you to comment on that, but I do want you to comment on the FICC franchise.
Obviously, the world changed and lots of repositioning happened, but you're way over where you used to think
your expected quarterly levels will be. So, what I do want to ask is, what have you noticed on the client front in
terms of the coverage, taking on new clients, client wallet penetration? Because we haven't seen everybody's
results, but I think these results show you taking share in a great quarter, great quarter for everybody, but taking
share despite that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. I think it's really a little of everything. Every business contributed. We've risk-managed extremely well, and
recognize the team now has been working together for about three years. They're really working well. I
commented about some progress we continue to make in mindshare of our FID clients, particularly around asset
managers, in penetrating those accounts through the coordinated approach. So, it's been a really strong set of
sort of backdrop, but also playing to sort of the work that we've been doing in that business and investing in.
Clearly, the market – or the wallet is significantly up this quarter, and we participated in that growth, and we
believe we captured more share. To the degrees that the wallet shrinks, we feel very good about the positions
that we've established and we expect to continue to maintain that share. But it's really going to be the results
being driven by what the wallet size looks like going forward.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2020
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
I would add – I mean I'd take it back, and Glenn, you've been covering us for a long time, so you know the history.
But let's go back to 2015 and – when Colm and Ted restructured the FICC business, and I think it's the fourth
quarter, November, December, we cut the RWAs. We cut the people and the expenses by 25%, which was seen
as pretty brutal at the time. The RWAs came down from – I forget the original numbers, but somewhere around
$300 billion to about $140 billion over a couple of year period. And we got out of the physical commodities
business. We had a much smaller footprint in the structured trading business. The SPG business was run a lot
more tightly.
And I think the work the team put together to create an integrated investment bank, leveraging the incredibly
strong equities franchise with many of the same clients who are dealing with their fixed income franchise, and at
the same time, building up DCM, which created, obviously, further opportunity across all of Fixed Income. So, it's
a series of things. Now, we always said that the business was – long-term, if it couldn't do $1 billion in revenue in
a quarter, really wasn't a viable business. So, it was never going to meet its cost of capital. And we sort of set that
target out. There was the minimum threshold against the backdrop of doing $500 million, $600 million for two
quarters in 2015. So, that was pretty modest backdrop. And obviously, our competitors were doing multi-billions at
that point.
We then consistently delivered the last couple of years around $1.5 billion a quarter. We kind of nominally raised
our minimum target to $1.25 billion, acknowledging you might have a bad quarter occasionally. But we've de-
risked that enormously. So, the swings are much less volatile on the downside. Here, we benefited from the
massive financing wave, very active markets, I think a really good integrated investment bank led by Ted Pick.
[ph] Sammy (00:33:15) Kellie-Smith is running Fixed Income, who had been previously the number two guy in the
equities franchise for a long time. Putting all of that, the management together, the culture together, the risk
management together and away from the big structured illiquid positions and away from physical commodities,
and it's all started to come together.
So, we're picking up share. And when you have a market explosion that everybody's numbers are up, I don't
know, 60%, 80%, then off our base, you can start posting really respectable numbers. And that's sort of where
we've got to. So, it's really a multi-year story. Now, are we going to do $3 billion in Fixed Income revenues this
quarter? No, we're not going to do $3 billion in revenues, at least from what I see in the outlook, but that doesn't
mean we're going to have a bad quarter by any stretch. So, it's that kind of backdrop that I feel – I feel really good
about our share position globally against the banks. We'll never have some of the big macro businesses that the
big universal banks have, particularly in FX, where we just have a much smaller footprint. But nonetheless, our
macro business traded really well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Well, that brings in a follow-up is, now that the Fed has realized what you and many others thought about your
excess capital position, you've mentioned in the past about using some of it to augment the franchise and asset
management. But let's say the shackles come off sometime next year, it doesn't matter when, what's your thought
process around deploying capital? Are there places to meaningfully deploy capital across the markets franchise?
Or is the plan the same, use it to augment asset management, return the rest? Like, how are you thinking about
the excess capital now that the Fed finally agrees?

James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. I don't think this is either this or that. We're in a great position now. We've got, under the SCB, about 200
basis points of excess capital. We'll pick up – Jon's saying it's actually...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

300 basis points.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
300 basis points. I'm sorry. I shortchanged us by 100 basis points, who knew that could happen. We've got – the
CET1 will be enhanced further by the E*TRADE closure. And obviously, it's not at that level, but it's still additive to
our capital base. If we come in with an SCB shortfall, we'd be looking at doing things with the RWAs in the
business. There'd be more pressure on that. We don't have that pressure. So, the share gains that we picked up,
we can maintain or even enhance. And strategically, we'll look across the trading franchise, not to go gangbusters
on that. But are there opportunities where we can continue to pick up share? Possibly. We're certainly open to
that.
In asset management, as you know, we've talked about this for a number of years because we're – our asset
management franchise, as I said, our numbers have gone from beginning of 2019, I think they were at $480
billion. We're over $630 billion, $640 billion now, attracting really good flows. The platform is building up well.
We'd love to augment that. So, that's a clear intent. Wealth Management, we did it with E*TRADE. So, the
opportunities to use capital are four, one around further balance sheet expansion if we want to do that. And our
bias is to be conservative to be fair. We don't – but the good news is we're not going to have to restructure or
shrink our business because of some capital shortfall. So, number one, that. Number two, asset management
transactions. Number three, just investment in our platform and our technology to continue to modernize Morgan
Stanley.
Number four, our dividend – we're paying out about $0.35 a quarter, which is about $2 billion – bit over $2 billion
annually. We made in the first half of this year about $5 billion. So, we've covered almost 2.5 years of dividends in
the first half of this year. So, our dividend coverage is very comfortable. I would love to expand the dividend in
time. I've always said I think we should pay out effectively what we make in Wealth Management as dividend and
think of that as a yield stock and think of the institutional business as a growth stock. So, that's coming. And then
obviously, getting back on the buyback train. We've still got – we've got 1.5 billion-and-a-change of shares
outstanding. We started this at about 2 billion. We'd like to continue to drive that number down. We don't want to
sit on this capital and not put it to work for shareholders. We want to put it to work.

Good morning, James and Jon. Maybe, Jon, to clarify, I think [indiscernible] (00:38:04) asked. But just to clarify on
the Wealth Management NII, the jump-off point for 3Q is $1 billion in 2Q and that will drift lower from $1 billion,
right? Just because there's confusion around are you talking about ex prepay numbers, et cetera. I just wanted to
clarify that. It's really the $1 billion in this quarter and that's how to think about where the jump-off point is.

Jonathan Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. The first two quarters, again, we're approximately $1 billion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christian Bolu Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Okay, perfect. Okay, thank you. Clear. And then just more broadly, I think you alluded to learning a lot about the
expense structure of the business over the last few months. So, maybe just provide a bit more detail on kind of
how you're thinking about – what you've learnt and sort of like how you think that ultimately affects the long-term
efficiency ratio potential of the firm?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. I would say, Christian, that we – first of all, the crisis is clearly not over. We're still in the middle of this and
we're continuing to learn about our infrastructure and our employees and what's the most efficient way to work.
So, those comments were really around, first, we have to get through this, and then longer term, I think there's
some interesting things that can come out of it. Clearly, the work-from-home as a backup or – as a backup or
BCP planning measure is clearly an acceptable one. We've been now at 90% of the folks working from home for a
while now and the plan continues to hold up quite well. So, I think there are some things that we can learn from
that as well. And so, I think again longer term, real estate decisions take a long time, given leases and ownership.
But I think that we'll take a look at the footprint over time. But our first priority right now is to get through the health
crisis and keep our employees safe.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. Let me just say a couple of things about expenses and about that real estate comment in particular,
because something I've said, I think, on the last call or on a TV interview was picked up and blown out of
proportion. Firstly, on the real estate footprint, I said we'd learnt to live with all of our people working from home or
most of them, and therefore, that gave us an opportunity to rethink our real estate strategy. That was interpreted
by some in the media as we're going to radically shift our footprint in our major locations. That's not going to
happen. We're committed to the major cities in this world, where we have our headquarters here in New York,
where I am today with Jon, although socially distanced; London, Frankfurt, which we've moved and consolidated
as our European headquarters; Tokyo and Hong Kong. That doesn't change.
Morgan Stanley will remain a major player in the commercial real estate market globally. However, when we think
about our DCP backup centers, when we think about our consolidation in various offshore centers and our density
management, when we think about some of our excess capacity across our branch network, is this the time to
start addressing those issues? Clearly, we have more flexibility to do it than we would have under normal
circumstances. And that's what we're talking about. Are we going to be radically expanding real estate across the
firm over the next five years? I doubt that very much. But are we going to be radically shrinking it? I doubt that
very much. So, hopefully, that puts a more reasonable turn on what was picked up in those comments.
On the non-comp expenses though, just to say, we put on $3 billion of extra revenue this quarter and we put on
about $100 billion of extra non-comp expenses. This business has unbelievable operating leverage. Now, to be
fair, it goes both ways, right. If you lose $3 billion in revenue, you can't bring down your non-comps that quickly.
So, it goes both directions. But if we're in a growth mode and we can control these non-comps, and obviously,
12


Morgan Stanley
(MS) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2020 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2020
comp except in Wealth Management is simply a ratio that we can manage, you have embedded huge operating
leverage in the business, and that's why we saw the ROTCE numbers that we saw this quarter.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Carrier Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. First, it seems like forever ago, but just how are you thinking
about some of the strategic initiatives that you highlighted at the start of the year just given the current
environment? Obviously, a lot of puts and takes, and outlook is still uncertain, but just an update would be helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Well, I would touch on – and maybe Jon wants to also add a little bit – just on the – I think we went public with
three metrics, pre-tax margin sort of medium-term and then long-term aspiration, efficiency ratio the same, and
ROTCE the same. Now, not to be cute about it, but in this quarter, we achieved the long-term aspiration of
efficiency ratio and the ROTCE. I'm not pretending that that's a steady state right now. I'll be very happy if we go
back to achieving what we said we'd do in the two-year period, and we're only six months into that two-year
period. But as I said, we have the non-comp operating leverage. So, the efficiency ratio to revenue growth, I think,
is a slam-dunk.
The ROTCE, again, with this kind of operating leverage and without the credit provisions, if you have revenue
growth, I'm very comfortable with those. The Wealth Management one, that's more challenged, because we did
not expect to go to effectively zero interest rates at the beginning of the year. That said, even with this
environment and with the pretty lousy print at the start of the quarter and with some of the integration costs that
are coming from E*TRADE built in, they still hit margins of over 24%. And I think they will grind their way back up
into the zone that we talked about. How quickly that's going to happen? Mike, I'm not going to predict, but it's not
going to be forever.
So, overall, we stand by the strategy, but we can't – nobody in this world can predict, goodness, what the next
month is going to be like, let alone the rest of this year. And we've got a presidential election coming, all sorts of
massive uncertainty. Some of that uncertainty, as we just demonstrated, plays to our favor. So, I don't – Jon, I'm
sure, will have a view on when these medium-term goals – when it's realistic to come and talk seriously about
them again. But it's too early yet, but it is interesting that through the first half of this year, we're basically on track
for two of the three of them.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. And the only other observation I would make is when we laid out those goals, we hadn't announced the
E*TRADE transaction yet either. So, we're going to – I think the course of the rest of the year and getting the deal
closed and seeing where we end up, and then when we come back in January, I'm sure we'll update you on what
we're seeing and how we feel about those goals.

Michael Carrier Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Okay, makes sense. And just a quick follow-up on E*TRADE, just given a lot of the industry changes in Wealth
and online banking, you guys mentioned in providing you with online brokerage and like the corporate platform.
Just how are you thinking about like the online banking kind of aspect, and in addition to that, the RIA custody
platforms as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
The online banking is clearly additive. Building our digital banking across our millions of households in our Wealth
Management, using the E*TRADE platform for that, clearly additive. The other question was, I think, the RIA
platform. Early days, but I've always – that's a decent business model. It just isn't one that we've had. Now, we've
got an opportunity with it through E*TRADE and I like – why not, right. That's an opportunity for us to pursue, but
it's very early days. It's a tiny business for them. Our major – obviously, the elephant is our core advisory
business, and that's not going to be disrupted. But we'll take a look at the RIA stuff as we get into it next year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. And I would just add that the E*TRADE has performed exceptionally well during this period, sort of
validated many of the reasons why we're so excited about doing the transaction. Customer activity levels are at
record highs, exceptional net new asset and account growth. At this point through their public disclosures through
May, they've sort of outperformed on new assets and clients sort of all of last year. The plant has held up very
well. The technology is excellent. They've had no hard outages. And all of the reasons why we bought the
company, I think, have been enhanced and validated through this period.

Andrew Lim Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (UK)
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Great results. I just wondered if you could talk a bit more about your
E*TRADE ambitions. I know, obviously, the numbers and your targets are going to be disclosed later. But
strategically, can you just talk more specifically about what you hope to achieve with the integration in terms of
like maybe – like ambitions on the revenue synergy front? Or was it mainly just like a scale gain, obviously, the
big UI in asset and Wealth Management, the – plus efficiencies you get. And then secondly, a few of your
competitors have talked about the shape of trading for the second half. I was wondering what your expectations
were for the second half versus the first half, but also versus the second half of 2019. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Well, I will touch briefly on the strategic rationale for E*TRADE. We did that earlier this year, but I'll repeat that.
And Jon, I'm sure, will have a crystal ball on what the second half is going to look like versus the second half of
last year. I'd be interested to hear his crystal ball because we're all kind of curious how it's going to unfold. But I
14

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2020
will say I'm very comfortable with Morgan Stanley as an institution through the second half of this year. We have
many, many businesses and much of our revenues that are not driven by the volatile trading activity. So, anyway,
I'll let Jon handle that one.
Just quickly on E*TRADE, Andrew, as you know and I think as we said very clearly at the time, it makes us, I
think, the largest player in the workplace sector in this country, which is the third channel for client acquisition
behind some sort of advisory, personal interaction and digital. It makes us the second or third largest player in the
digital space, and we're the first or largest player in the core advisory space. So, we're in all three channels. It
diversifies our revenues as an institution by adding $3 billion of revenue. It improves our CET1 ratio. It gives us a
platform to take digitally, internationally. It creates an opportunity for us to build the digital bank across our Wealth
Management business. They have a small RIA platform, which I mentioned, which is interesting.
We have obviously some expense consolidation across the two platforms. They have a terrific brand for a
younger generation of investors. They have a terrific brand for more active trader investors and options trading
investors, which we're excited about. So, there are a long line of things that make this attractive. And the test was
how did they hold up in this period of incredible volatility, and as Jon just said, they held up extraordinarily well.
They've attracted hundreds of thousands of new accounts, but with that has come real money, not just kids
playing. This is real stuff. They brought in billions of dollars of net new assets and deposits, and their platform has
remained very stable.
So, that is the E*TRADE story. It's a continuing evolution of the Morgan Stanley strategy and a nod to the fact that
having stronger digital capability across our Wealth Management business is critical and a nod to the fact that
we're interested in expanding internationally.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
I will not attempt to make a crystal ball prediction. But given some of the comments that I made in my opening
remarks, clearly, we have a differentiated model with Wealth and IM, which is sort of the stability of that model,
and those businesses should continue to perform quite well, and then the – which we referred to historically as
the ballast, and then the ISG creates some of the alpha. As James said, it would be hard to see how we
reproduce the first half results in the second half results. But we also think we'll continue to do quite well, given
the market share gains that we've made and the client penetration that we have, and it's really just going to be a
function of what the wallet size is in the second half. And I don't think anyone has the ability to predict what that
will be.

Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
All right, great. Good morning. I guess first question here with respect to DFAST, and thanks for the color, and
obviously, the overall positive outcome. But James, you mentioned working with the regulators' stressed
scenarios aren't, I don't think, necessarily reflecting how the business actually behaves, and we've seen that in
trading over the past couple of quarters in what's, I think, a real-world stress test. So, I'm just curious if these are
normal conversations just around future DFAST assumptions and modeling that you kind of always have or is it
related to the 2020 outcome? It sounds like some peers like Goldman are potentially petitioning for some relief.
So, I'm just kind of curious around that comment.

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2020
James Patrick Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Morgan Stanley
Yeah. I think, Devin, I don't want to get ahead of the regulators, and we haven't obviously discussed anything
relating to capital and capital requirements in the light of these earnings. But it's a more fundamental view. If you
go back to 2008, 2009, regulators would be entirely justified in being highly skeptical of Morgan Stanley's
business model at that point, given our trajectory coming out of the financial crisis. And the early days when the
integration of Smith Barney looked to be slower than what most people had hoped, it never bothered me by the
way, but most people were anxious about it. So, there was kind of a period of let's just wait and see. And I think
some of the market models that they put in place that affect all of the banks disproportionately hurt Morgan
Stanley.
As the time has progressed and the business model has played out and the stability of the franchise now fully
tested here, and with producing ROE over 15%, and most of the competitive set are 400 basis points to 800 basis
points below that, it certainly gives pause to reflect on the stability of the business model. Now, let's play it out a
couple more quarters. I've said for a long time that PPNR results do not reflect certainly what we think about the
business. And for that, we believe that there is a model issue relating to financial advisor compensation, how fixed
that is believed to be when in fact it's not fixed at all. It's a commission-based structure. So, there's potential for
the regulatory relief on that, which we've been arguing for, for many years, and I think it's well-understood now by
the regulators.
But listen, Morgan Stanley is not the Morgan Stanley it was 10 years ago. We're a different institution. We didn't
have the credit provisions that everybody else had. That's not luck. That's by design. We don't have exposure to
unsecured consumer credit. We have very little emerging market credit. We have very little small business and
middle-market lending. It's by design. So, at some point, if your model is built not to endure the credit kind of hits
that the other banks naturally have given their portfolio and you don't have the illiquidity that you had in your
trading businesses, and you have the ballast of the Wealth Management and the repetitiveness of those revenues
and earnings, then you're a different kind of animal. And that's really what we've been arguing for, for a long time.
I'm not going to get ahead of the regulatory discussions. We've got another CCAR test, Jon, coming, I think, in the
next couple of months. So, clearly, that test will reflect a COVID type world more explicitly than the last one, and
we'll play it out. But Morgan Stanley currently has excess capital, and I believe we just accreted another $3 billion.
I believe we're going to accrete excess capital through the rest of this year and be sitting with many billions of
dollars of excess capital at year-end, and we want to do something with that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Let me just add a couple of quick observations. One, there is a formal appeals process. We are not entertaining
that. These are just natural and normal dialogues we have with our regulators, and as James said, we've been
talking about it with them for years. I do think that we saw some recognition of that in this year's results. Some of
the PPNR modeling is more reflective of more recent results. And obviously, given the transformation that we've
gone through, we started to see some of that in the results. But again, we think there's more there.
And then, on the last point of a resubmission, as James said, the Fed did release sensitivity analysis. It was very
geared towards lending and credit losses. As he mentioned, we do have a differentiated portfolio, not only in
terms of its make-up, but also in terms of its size. We've avoided unsecured consumer, very limited small
business, middle-market, small commercial banking. So, it's just a much different model, and I think it will fare
quite well in the resubmission. And obviously, we've all seen what the trading results have been through this
16

Q2 2020 Earnings Call 16-Jul-2020
many stress tests. So, we feel good about the capital position. We feel good about where we stand in CCAR, and
we continue to talk to our regulators about sort of the results and the transformation that this company has gone
through.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Rutschow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Rutschow Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. The first question is on deposits. How did the delay in the tax
deadline impact deposits in the second quarter? Have you seen a run-off in the last couple of weeks as we
approached the deadline? And is there still an opportunity to reinvest some of those deposits at higher rates to
pick up some yield?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jonathan Pruzan A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Morgan Stanley
Sure. So, it clearly has had an impact. The payment date was yesterday. Typically, we see the run-off sort of post
the payment date. Historically, it's sort of been in and around $5 billion to $6 billion. So, we would expect
something comparable and similar there. But I think the interesting dynamic around the deposits are, as you said,
we have the excess position. We've seen sort of a rotation into the markets really slowing. So, if you look at this
period, we saw about $20 billion of cash come into the system from a combination of dividends and interest, but
also new cash into the system, and only $15 billion of that went into the market. So, net up $5 billion in BDP. As I
just said, we would expect to see some of that flow out with tax payments.
But what we've definitely seen is last year this period, that number would not have been positive at all. It was
about a negative $10 billion. So, the deposit levels have really stabilized and started to creep up. And I think what
the opportunity for us is as the durability of these deposits increase, and we've seen them to be pretty stable now,
we'll probably just continue to pay down some of our higher cost wholesale liabilities. We've got about $25 billion
of CDs that will run-off over the next 18 months. We clearly don't need to replace those and some other third-party
arrangements as well. So, it's really going to be around reducing some of the wholesale liabilities and then
continue to deploy that into the lending growth that we're seeing in that business.
