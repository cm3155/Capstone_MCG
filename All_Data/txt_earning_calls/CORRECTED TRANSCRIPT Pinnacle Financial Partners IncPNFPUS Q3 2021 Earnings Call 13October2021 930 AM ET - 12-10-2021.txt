M. Terry Turner
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thank you, operator, and thank you, everybody, for being with us this morning. In my view, third quarter was an
exceptional quarter with very strong loan growth, very strong core deposit growth, strong net interest income
growth, and strong non-interest income growth. Asset quality is [ph] the second best (00:02:35) numbers for most
key asset quality metrics, and importantly, our relentless focus on tangible book value accretion continue to yield
strong results.
I believe what is evident is that our decade-long approach to attracting exciting market best bankers and
empowering and enabling them to create [ph] raise in (00:02:53) clients is, in fact, enriching shareholders. And
because of the sustained execution of that model, I expect that to continue to produce exciting results for an
extended period of time to come.
There've been various studies over the years revealing the key shareholder returns for banks will generally be
about EPS growth rates, revenue growth rates, and asset quality. Our business model is generally a roughly 80%
spread business, which means an ability to consistently take share and grow the balance sheet is the key to
revenue and EPS growth rate, which is why we focus intently on loan and deposit growth rates. And so, we begin
every shareholder presentation with this dashboard, which gives us a read on revenue and EPS growth, balance
sheet growth, and asset quality.
Of course, we always start with the GAAP measures, but I found for me personally, I focus on a number of non-
GAAP measures that have me better ascertain how well we're performing on the key variables that we're trying to
manage here at Pinnacle. As you look across the top row, you can see remarkably consistent up into the right
growth in revenues, EPS, and adjusted pre-tax pre-provision net revenues.
Similarly, across the second row, we produced net loan growth this quarter even with meaningful PPP pay downs
and forgiveness. Annualized organic loan growth excluding the impacts of PPP was 15.3%. Core deposits,
specifically non-interest-bearing deposits, continued to soar in Q3. And all that resulted in a tangible book value
per share CAGR of 12.7% since 2016. Along the bottom row, you can see our asset quality performed
exceptionally well even during COVID. Net charge-offs were inside our targets and the other key problem loan
categories we monitor are at decade long loans.
I'd like to peel back the onion just a minute to provide better insight as to what causes the key growth metrics to
be so consistently up into the right, as we were positioned in some of the best markets in this country to grow,
which of course is the simplest part of our growth formula. We should produce outsized growth simply because
the markets in which we operate are expected to continue to outgrow the nation. But beyond that, as a result of
our ability to attract the market best bankers, both in the markets in which we currently operate as well as in other
3

large urban markets in the southeast where we're likely to have additional market extending opportunities, and the
proven ability of these bankers to wow our clients in an environment where our largest competitors have so many
angry and frustrated clients, should yield meaningful outsized growth.
And I hasten to add our formula of only hiring highly experienced revenue producers puts us in an unusual
position to produce an outsized growth while maintaining an attractive asset quality metric since the market share
movement occurs as a result of these experienced bankers moving their borrowers when they're [indiscernible]
(00:05:55) behind it's the only way I know to reliably produce such rapid growth on a sound basis. It seems
obvious from the dashboard slide that we began with this model has in fact produced rapid, reliable growth over
an extended period of time. But I want to spend a minute focusing on our model and why I expect it to continue to
produce outsized growth. While the model is radically simple as a concept, it's our relentless execution over 21
years that differentiates us.
As I've already said, our model to attract and excite market best bankers, empower and enable them to create
[ph] raise in clients (00:06:35), which would then translate shareholder returns. Our associate engagement is
literally among the best employers in the country. It's longstanding. It's across virtually every associate group, like
being one of the best workplaces for women, for millennials, for parents, and it's across our entire footprint in
virtually every major market. It works that way because we've got a unique hiring model, because we've got a
value-based culture, our annual incentive model where a 100% of our associates win and lose together based on
achieving corporate performance targets for things like asset quality and EPS growth rates.
Our long-term incentive model, which makes shareholders out of every single associates, and our leadership,
management and accountability for how well they engage their associates just to name a few. Over the years, I've
heard any number of bankers saying that they were running the Pinnacle model, but honestly, virtually, none of
them were doing any one of those things that I just mentioned. Building on that foundation, they decided to
[indiscernible] (00:07:41) to wow their clients, which create great advance.
Things like our focus on geographic decision making close to the client as opposed to centralized line of business
structures, which we combine with our signature [ph] creditism which yields favored response, (00:07:56) a wide
budget where every single associate is authorized to spend any amount they deem appropriate in order to wow
clients. All of these are recognizably different than our primary competitors, which enables these highly
experienced associates to wow their clients.
In the center era, we're looking at a net promoter score provided by Greenwich for businesses with annual sales
from $1 million to $500 million. Our net promoter score is market leading in both the State of Tennessee and
North Carolina and extremely high ranking in every metropolitan market in which we have large enough share that
produces statistically valid sample.
In fact, according to Greenwich, we have the second highest net promoter score in the United States. That's
indeed an unusually engaged client base who recommends us to their peers and result in strong momentum,
meaning they also indicate a high likelihood that they intend to do more business with us.
And on the far right, you can see that we've successfully translated that relentless focus on our associates and
clients into shareholder value. The shareholder returns have been outsized. I might even say astoundingly
outsized from the beginning and over the prior 10-year, 5-year, 3-year and 1-year time horizons. So, as you can
see, the model has indeed yielded remarkably reliable and predictable outcomes.

And then finally, as it relates to the sustainability of the growth, one of the things that has been so far about what
our future growth is, is the pace at which we're attracting these market best revenue producers. I don't think it's a
secret that a number of the banks that are the largest market shareholders in our markets, which are in the
southeast, are extraordinarily vulnerable and I would say emerging talent. Some are vulnerable because they
simply become so large and bureaucratic. Some are what appear to be regulatory difficulties, which invariably
makes the lives of bankers miserable, and some are inwardly focused as a result of merger and integration
projects.
Pinnacle is widely recognized as an employer of choice for all the reasons we've already discussed this morning.
And the more bankers we hire from these large banks – the more bankers we're able to hire from these large
banks much like [indiscernible] (00:10:18) created clients that are net promoters, that recommend us to their
friends and peers, we created associates that are net promoters that vouch for us and invite their peers from their
former employers to join us at Pinnacle.
This created extraordinary opportunities to hire in the markets that we currently operate in, but it's also created
market extending opportunities like Atlanta, Georgia, Birmingham, Alabama, Huntsville, Alabama. And I fully
expect that we will encounter other similar opportunities in other large, high-growth markets around the southeast.
As you can see on the left, we've attracted a very large number of revenue producers over the last few years. In
fact, roughly 22% of our revenue producers have been here less than two years. Think about that, 22% of our
revenue producers have been here less than two years. Our experience is that it generally takes relationship
manager four to five years to fully move their book of business. So that would lead me to believe we're currently
incurring 100% of the expenses that are associated with substantial revenue production we should materialize
over the next two to three years. You can see the power of that not only on balance sheet and revenue growth,
but on earnings growth as well.
And to the right, you gain some sense of the power of the model. When you attract so many experienced revenue
producers from the banks that have the largest market share in these markets, you're in an unusual opportunity to
capitalize on their vulnerability and accelerate share gains. So, in short, in addition to the highlighting the – up into
the right performance that we've had and continued this quarter on virtually all key metrics that influence
shareholder returns, I've tried to illustrate both why I believe it has happened and why I'm so personally excited
about the ongoing growth opportunity I see for the firm.
With that, I'll turn it over to Harold for a more in depth look at the quarter.

Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thanks, Terry. Good morning, everybody. We're again pleased with our third quarter loan growth results.
Excluding PPP, average loans were up 14.2% between the third and second quarters. And as to end of period
loans at September 30 compared to June 30, we're up 15.3%. Overall, loan rates were up slightly from the
second quarter as the third quarter was again assisted by PPP forgiveness. We believe we will see another
meaningful quarter of PPP forgiveness in the fourth quarter, so that PPP's impact on 2022 hopefully will be
minimal.
Due to accelerated forgiveness, third quarter yield on PPP loans rose to 8.54% from 5.47% in the second quarter.
We recognized $21 million of PPP revenues in the third quarter, down from $26 million in the second quarter. Due
to PPP balances now dropping to approximately $700 million at the end of the third quarter, we anticipate fourth
quarter PPP revenues will range somewhere between $12 million and $15 million.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2021
Excluding PPP loans, our average loan yield approximated 3.93% compared to approximately 3.98% in the
second quarter. We've been stating for quite some time that maintaining loan yields will be a difficult chore, but
with some tailwind on rising rates, we can be hopeful that increasing loan yields are just around the corner. I
commend our sales force for what they've been able to accomplish so far this year.
Our new markets in Huntsville and Birmingham have recruited seven revenue producers from a standing start and
after only a few weeks of operations have approximately $40 million in loans, slightly more in deposit, and a great
pipeline. Atlanta continues to roll with 18 revenue producers and $345 million in loans at September 30. Our
optimism for these markets as well as our new hires in equipment finance and franchise lending, give us reason
to be even more optimistic about our loan growth targets for next year.
Previously, we've been talking about high-single digit growth for this year. Our market leaders are even more
optimistic about our loan growth and that they will likely end up with low-double digit growth rate for 2021. As for
2022, given current economic conditions and our optimism about our new markets and business lines, we believe
a growth rate for loans inclusive of PPP payoffs of low-double digits is a reasonable objective for our firm.
Now on to deposits, we had another big deposit quarter. Core deposits were up almost $1.3 billion in the third
quarter. We experienced significant growth pin non-interest bearing deposit ending up at $9.8 billion at quarter
end, up 32.4% since the end of last year. Our average deposit rates were 17 basis points while EOP deposit rates
were at 15 basis points. So, we continue to see downward momentum for 2021 and look to see a few more basis
points in reduced deposit costs by year-end. Helping us get there would be about $691 million in maturing CDs in
the fourth quarter, which have an average rate of approximately 57 basis points.
As to liquidity, we continue to look at ways to create increased earnings momentum through deployment of
excess liquidity into higher yielding assets, as well as elimination of wholesale funding sources where we are
getting close to accomplishing that. We are optimistic that loan volume growth in 2022 should help reduce our
overall liquidity next year, but this will be a multiyear effort. Our objective here is to find ways to put money to work
in a rising rate environment without placing too much risk on tangible book value growth. More to come on this as
this will be a topic for several quarters, but suffice it to say that we are all gaining more confidence as to the
stickiness of all this deposit growth that has occurred over the last year-and-a-half.
As to credit, the four big traditional credit metrics of net charge-offs, classified assets, NPA and past due accruing
loans, Pinnacle's loan portfolio continue to perform very well, and in many cases, these are some of the best
credit metric ratios we've experienced in our history. For example, the trend lines for classified assets and NPA
since 2Q 2019, that's pre-COVID then through COVID until today, is a testament to the great work of our bankers
and credit officers. Additionally, we anticipate further declines in our allowance for loan loss to total loans ratio
over the next several quarters given continued improvement in these factors as well as macroeconomic factors.
Now to fee income, again lots of good news here. For the quarter, fee revenues were up more than 25% over the
third quarter of last year. Wealth management, which includes investment services, trust and insurance, had a
great quarter in comparison to last year. We continue to be very active on the hiring front across our franchise,
particularly as we continue to build wealth management in our newer markets.
Mortgage rebounded this quarter as this pipeline rebuilt towards the end of the third quarter. As to run rate issues
for 4Q, we had another strong showing with respect to our equity investments, which exclude BHG. Again, one of
our investments finalize an equity raise during the quarter, the results of which provided us significant insight into
an updated valuation of that investment and thus would book $4.7 million from this one investment along with
6

about almost $4 million from other valuation adjustments. All in, we don't expect a similar increase in the fourth
quarter. We also received about $1.5 million in vendor incentives on checking accounts. As to BHG, I'll talk about
that in just a second.
As to expenses, specifically incentives, I think everyone is familiar with the impact of incentive cost to our expense
base, so I won't go into all that this quarter. We continue to anticipate an outsized incentive for 2021. However,
there's no free lunch. Increased incentives only occur if our earnings and PPNR growth support the incentive.
Additionally, we anticipate our max payout target going back to the traditional 125% in 2022.
As to our overall total expense run rate, we now believe that expenses for the fourth quarter should be flat to
down from the amounts we experienced in both the second and third quarters and anticipate 8% to 11% growth in
2022, which is primarily attributable to head count growth, as well as our entering into new markets and new
business lines.
Quickly some comments on capital, we intend to redeem $120 million in sub-debt in mid-November. And as I
mentioned last time and I want to just reinforce the point, we've intensified our focus on tangible book value
growth by adding a peer relative component in our leadership's equity compensation plan. We are currently
calculating an annualized increase of 13.4% in tangible book value per share thus far in 2021, which we believe is
pretty good relative to other peers.
Our plan is designed such that we will compare our tangible book value per share growth with that of our peers
along with relative ROTCE and total shareholder return in determining the ultimate vesting results for our
leadership group. Lastly, as to our outlook for the rest of 2021, I won't go into the slide in depth as we covered
much of this previously. So, this again is really a summary for the model builders out there of what we think about
the fourth quarter of this year.
Now to BHG, many of you participated in a BHG investor call we had last month. Al Crawford and Dan McSherry
did a great job in updating everyone on BHG's activities. Since there has not been any meaningful change since
that time, I will spend less time on BHG this go around.
I will highlight that BHG did close their third securitization since the conference call and look to have another
probably in the first quarter of next year. The blue bars on the top left chart details originations with records being
set nearly every quarter for the past three quarters. The green bar represents loans of which gain on sale has
been recorded as these loans are sold to downstream banks.
Obviously, the gap between loan originations and loan sold find their way onto BHG's balance sheet for either a
downstream sale in a later quarter or perhaps becoming part of a future securitization. Loan yields ended at
13.9% for the third quarter. As to the bank buy rate, they fell to 3.4%. So, net spreads remain in 10% range. The
bottom right chart details now over 1,200 banks in BHG's network and almost 700 individual banks acquired BHG
loans last year. Coupled with the securitization process, BHG remains one of the strongest funding platforms in
the country.
As to credit, we've updated BHG's recourse obligation chart. On the chart on the left, the green bars detail loans
that BHG has sold to their network of community and other banks, which currently amount to $4.1 billion in credit
sold through their network. The blue line details the recourse accrual as a percentage of outstanding loans with
these banks. BHG decreased the pandemic-related recourse reserves again this quarter to approximately $230
million at the end of the quarter.

As a percentage of loans, it was 5.67%, down approximately 75 basis points. As noted on the chart at the bottom
right, the trailing 12 2021 losses landed at 4.73%. This chart splits the actual credit losses from losses BHG
absorbed from reimbursing banks for the unamortized premium the acquiring bank paid to get the loan. The
increase for prepayment losses is partially attributable to actual premiums paid for BHG credit has gotten larger,
consumer credit tends to have a higher prepayment track record and loans being paid off earlier as rates have
decreased.
Top left chart, we've shown on several occasions. The quality of BHG's borrowers has improved steadily in the
past. And over the last few years, BHG continues to refine their scorecards and increase the quality of its
borrowing base. Looking at losses, our vintage losses continue to level out in earlier months, thus pointing toward
a lower loss percentage over the life of the underlying loan. Pandemic-related events may cause these losses to
move upward, but the quality of the borrowing base, in our opinion, is very impressive and is much better than just
from a few years ago.
Just a tad more on credit, for the loans sold to other banks, credit losses or substitution losses as noted in the
previous slide for the first nine months of this year have amounted to 2.8%, with third quarter substitution losses
coming in at around 2.4%. For loans on balance sheet held for investment and potentially future securitization,
year-to-date losses have amounted to approximately 1.3%, with third quarter losses being approximately 1.4%.
BHG had another great quarter in the third quarter and exceeded our expectations yet again. We've kept our
expectations for 2021 at approximately 40% growth. We're also sticking with a growth factor for 2022 of
approximately 30%. As the slide indicate they've got more ideas that are in some stage of development, which if
successful, should foster continued growth over the next several quarters.
BHG is in the process of planning their growth for the next several years. They believe that over the next few
years interest income from owned balance sheet loans will likely exceed the gain on sale model. How they
proceed will obviously impact the timing for income recognition as gain on sale accelerates current income while
the owned balance sheet model recognizes income over the life of the loan. As to the other business
opportunities noted on the slide, they are analyzing all of these to further develop their financial plans as they aim
to continue their outsized growth.
So wrapping up, as to loan growth and loan pricing for Pinnacle in 2021, it will take a lot of work, but we are very
optimistic. Deposit growth has been remarkable. Deposit pricing continues to decrease. Net interest income we
believe will be flattish for the fourth quarter. BHG has another great quarter and we continue to believe in that
franchise. Expenses should be flat to down again in the fourth quarter with that of the third quarter.
Operator, with that, I'll turn it back over to you for questions.

M. Terry Turner A

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Terry, you did a really good job of kind of talking through the hiring strategy and how it's benefited you over these
21 years. I was wondering if you could go even a little deeper into that and talk about what you're seeing on the
kind of economic growth front versus the takeaway hiring growth front and kind of how you think about that within
your forward growth guidance? Is that still primarily in anticipation of growth from your hires or are you guys
seeing some actual economic – positive economic growth trends as well?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I would say that we have not seen a lot of what I would call pure economic growth. I don't – it's probably
something better than zero, but it wouldn't be robust by any means. If you look at things like line of credit, working
capital lines, C&I lines, those kinds of things, we're not seeing increased funding there. And so, again, the
economic growth is greater than zero, but it's not very large. It is more about our new hires that are producing
volumes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And when you guys think about trying to forecast growth for your franchises, I mean how do you think
about that? Is it, hey, if we got 5% economic growth, we could actually grow 15%, or do you guys break it down in
that kind of fashion as you think about forecasting?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
We – Steve, I think we're like anybody else we're going to look at it 12 different ways trying to figure out what
makes the most sense and what the truth is and all those kinds of things. So, we certainly try to look at it that way.
I think in the final analysis, what we most frequently land on is sort of a bottoms up outlook, what is it that the
financial advisors believe they're going to produce. So, what does the market leader believe, they're going to
produce based on the aggregation of what those guys are going to produce. And so, anyway it's some
9


Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
(PNFP) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2021 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2021
combination of all those things, but I personally put most confidence on market leaders and what they believe
they're going to be able to produce.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. And then, I'm wondering – you kind of talked about Birmingham, Huntsville, Atlanta and then some
new product expansions that you guys have moved into obviously, are there other I guess near-term expansions
on the horizon that you see, whether it be new product verticals that you all would like to get into from a lending
perspective or other new MSAs that you could highlight, or do you feel like you've got your plate pretty full with
what's going on now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, I guess the answer to the last question there is that we feel like we have our plate full, no, we don't feel that
way. We've got lots of opportunities and it's – I mean, honestly, it's an exciting time for us. There are just lots of
opportunities. When you think about our opportunities, again, so if everybody goes out in different way, so I just
sort of tell you how we go at it, mainly what we think about is talent acquisition. Mainly the way that occurs is
we've hired so many people who say, hey, you need to go hire [indiscernible] (00:28:32). You need to go hire this
person. I work with them up there. They share our values, then they can produce this, they can build this and so
forth.
And so, early in our company's existence that was primarily just got into hiring people at local geographic markets,
but because we have hired so many and expanding market, that word has gotten out, would create more
opportunities in other markets where people from some of the banks, like a Wells or Truist or those kinds of
things, where people are saying to their buddies, hey, man, can you help me get in over there, I might want to
build market in this [indiscernible] (00:29:09) in this market, those kinds of things.
And it would be the same idea on some of the specialty lending areas. Again, we have opportunities because the
people we've hired that hire people that have run in specialty practices for some of our largest competitors. And
so, that's really what stimulates that. So, we were trying to give you some things about how we think about it and
get back to primarily about talent acquisition, what's available and so forth about seizing the opportunities that we
like within that. And I guess the net of all that is I do believe we'll have opportunities to go to other larger in
southeastern markets in the reasonably short term, and I expect we'll have opportunities [indiscernible] (00:29:55)
specialty lending business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Great. Very helpful. Maybe just last thing for me. I'm curious if you have a number for how much you guys
added on balance sheet of BHG loans this quarter and kind of how you're thinking about that in terms of how
much that you'd want to put on balance sheet or if there's any sort of concentration limit you have in mind for that.

say, okay, this is what it is and this is what it is in this geographic market and so forth. My sense is that it is good
and that's my only basis for saying that is when you look at the Greenwich data, we have an extraordinarily high
percentage of our clients that view us to be their primary bank. And the number moves around some, Jared.
But I believe the number is 84% of the folks who have a relationship with us view us to be their primary bank. And
that's a really extraordinarily high penetration of being the primary bank to the folks who have any banking
relationship with. So, again, I'm just saying in the way our programs are built, the way the incentives are built,
everybody focused on meeting all of the needs of any plan that they have, but, specifically, to be able to say to
you, okay, this is what we've done on the PPP client, I couldn't do that.

Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Jared, yeah, I'll just follow up on one point on that quickly. I think if you go back to the start of the PPP program,
we specifically told our sales force to target our own clients and not use PPP so much as a business development
tool. So, we did give Atlanta kind of an exception of that because it was a new market. And I think the retention
there has been strong relative to PPP.
But we did not necessarily put PPP in the – a slot of being a business development kind of strategy. We felt like it
was a limited resource. We felt like that the government – that the money would fill up quickly and we wanted to
take care of individual clients first and foremost. I just want to add that point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yeah. Got it. Great. Thank you. And then, when we look at the expense growth rate of 2022, what's the underlying
expectation for revenue producers being hired, and is that growing from what we've seen in 2021, or is it sort of
stable in that 85 to 95 additional people?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think – and, Harold, again feel free to offer any color that you want. I think, Jared, that the expectation for
2021 will be higher than your number of 85 to 90. In other words, it will be kind of expected to be north of 100. I
think fourth quarter will be a pretty big hard quarter for us as well. And so, I think the annual number will be in the
110 to 120 range and I would expect that to be replicated in the next year 2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Jared, I'll just tag on here. Like all good CFOs, we've gotten our first look at the expense plan for next year and it'll
choke a horse. But anyway, there's a lot of people these – our folks are anticipating to hire. We'll get that to a
point where that 8% to 11% growth we believe traditionally is the right number for us. But Terry is absolutely right
I think our momentum on revenue producers is extraordinary right now and I think we've got some good news
coming over the next several quarters.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thanks. And then just finally for me, looking at those other investments, those other equity investments besides
BHG, can you give us an update on how much money have you invested in that program and what do you
expect? Do you expect to continue to grow that as an investment source, or are you happy with the amount you
put out there now?

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2021
Yeah. We fully anticipate continue to invest in these other joint venture firms. All of them we have some sort of
relationship with or have had a history of business transactions with all of them. I know early in our – early in
Pinnacle's life, we invested in several here in Nashville because traditionally we had known the principles. We've
worked with them over an extended period of time and I think to a large extent that has continued. These venture
funds bring us deposits. They bring us lending opportunities through their portfolio companies. And so, it makes
for a good business model for us. And that, that has held true here of recent times.
The fintechs we're focused on are the newer ones or ones that have some kind of financial bank-related
emphasis, and we'll continue to work that. I think I've got somewhere around $160 million of investments in these
various fintech firms. There's probably – I don't know, just a wild guess, 40 of them that we've got some sort of
commitment with. And we fully expect that that number will get bigger. Did I get to your question, Jared?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
You did. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks very much. And then, just I guess just finally tying up on that when you said that you
don't expect the same level of growth in realized gains in the fourth quarter, does that mean that we should expect
to see it drop back to more where it was first and second quarter, or that it won't grow from here but could be
sustainable at that level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, we fully expect that the value of these funds will appreciate at a reasonable rate over time. But
we've caught kind of lightning in a bottle here over the last couple of quarters with these investments and we don't
anticipate booking $8.7 million, $8.9 million in the fourth quarter. But we think we'll have something but it won't be
that.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2021
Terry, you guys are having a tremendous amount of success right now and I'm just wondering with all the
consolidation that's occurring in the industry right now, is there any type of opportunity that would be compelling
for you? And how do you think about opportunities like that with the backdrop of the buyer stocks getting so
punished most of the time these days? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, Jennifer, as you know, that's like my least favorite question, because every time I say something we did, it
doesn't turn out to be the right thing to say. But I'll do the best I can tell you what the truth is and let the cards fall
where they may. You know this going back, when our stock was getting hammered and growers were being
punished, we traded down their tangible book value and people kept asking about M&A and I kept saying, look,
no way, forget it. We're not going to do it. I just wouldn't deploy the stock when it was trading in that intangible
book value. As the multiples came back, I felt compelled to put the market on notice, hey, the answer is not
definitely no.
The answer is, well, there's a possibility of it. And I've tried to work that and help people understand. I need to say
it's possible because it is possible. We are – we did have an advantage paper and all that sort of stuff. But you
know this, Jennifer, because you've studied, you run the screens and run the scans, you know what we're looking
for, there are not a plethora of opportunities out there that would fit. And so, when I say fit, I'm just talking about hit
our earnings accretion targets, hit our cultural requirements, all those kind of things.
And so, I have not believed that even though I've tried to say, look, this is a possibility and I haven't believed it is
very likely and I continue to believe it's still not very likely. The organic growth opportunities that we're having right
now are breathtaking. And so, as you know, all that does is drive the – attracting this threshold up for doing an
M&A transaction. And so, it doesn't get more likely. I think it gets less likely because of all the organic growth
opportunities that we have.
Again, I refuse to rule it out. I want to be on record saying, hey, again, I hope – yeah, it's possible. We did have an
advantaged stock if we – my belief is if we find something that meets the accretion targets, hits the cultural
requirements, and is more attractive than the organic growth opportunities we have, my guess is me and you and
everybody else ought to be really excited. So, anyway, it's a possibility, but I think I wouldn't put it in the extremely
likely category.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Thanks, Terry. Are there any companies that could meet the cultural hurdle for you, because it seems like that
hurdle is the one that's really the most difficult?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I think that's true. I think the answer to that is yes. If I could catch it this way, Jennifer, I think, if you look back at
something like BNC, there are some people who kind of tend to follow what you call culture and what you include
in culture and those kinds of things or people who no doubt were skeptical of our ability to execute that
transaction. But the case was that Rick Callicutt has determined he needed to move away from the model that he
was running and wanted to move toward a model like we were running and that really – through that decision and
that choice for him preceded our getting together and all those kinds of things.

And so, it allowed for a cultural integration because the CEO was wanting to and trying to travel down the path we
were on, albeit different from the path he had originally been on. So, anyway, I'm just trying to say I think when
you find those kinds of situations where management teams are like minded about where to go and all those
kinds of things then you have a chance. And I do honestly believe we did have a growing number of people who
were curious about, inquisitive, and I'll just use this word, I guess, respectful of our model and interested in it.
So, you're on the right track. The cultural integration hurdle is difficult. And it does exclude lots of folks that might
show up well in if you're just running a model and – but we end up walking away because of cultural integration is
a bridge too far. My guess is there would be precious few, but a few where like-minded CEOs might be able to do
something but it'd be a precious few.

Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi, everyone. This is Anthony Elian on for Steve. Terry, you were very active in hiring new talent in the third
quarter in your newer markets of Atlanta, Birmingham and Huntsville. But these are the areas where you're seeing
the strongest pipelines for new hires compared with markets such as Tennessee and the Carolinas or is the
strength in recruiting pipelines across your entire footprint?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I think I would say generally the strength is across the entire footprint. Maybe just a little color behind that, we
have had a great hiring year in Raleigh, North Carolina. We've had a great hiring year in Charlotte, North
Carolina. Atlanta is a fabulous hiring market with lots of upside in it as well. And then to your point, I think we
believe we're going to make more hires in Birmingham and in Huntsville.
In the case of Nashville, we continue to make hires here. Some of the folks that we've hired here are – I would put
in the lending specialty category. We talked about equipment finance and franchise lending where we've been
able to attract some top-tier talent out of large competitors. And so that's sort of been the thrust here in Nashville.
But hopefully that's helpful to think about. We are seeing really strong hiring momentum in the largest, most
rapidly growing markets that are dominated by Wells and Truist in particular. So, I think that hopefully that tells
you what you're looking for.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yeah. That's helpful. And then on BHG, you reiterated the 2022 guidance of growth normalizing back to 30%. But
how much upside or potential upside is there from the new initiatives from BHG including targeting skilled
professions and eventually rolling out a potential point-of-sale lending product?

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2021
Hi, Tony. It's Harold. I don't know if we can give you a number to increase the 30%. Right now, we feel like 30% is
probably a good number to kind of use for your modeling if – what they could do as an alternative is increase their
own balance sheet lending focus and pull back on gain on sale to kind of warehouse for future years. So, I'd be
very hesitant increasing it over 30% right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Anthony Elian Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Great. And then finally on loan growth, so you're already doing low-double digits loan growth in the current
environment. But given all the hiring you've done, pipeline remaining strong, and potentially adding a few new
specialty lending segments, why wouldn't you be able to exceed the low-double digit loan growth guidance you
provided for 2022? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Terry, I'll start that and you can correct me. But – so, Tony, make sure you understand that for 2022 I said
inclusive of PPP paydowns. So we anticipate quite a bit of PPP paydowns next year. We started, call it, $700
million or so. So that loan growth target wouldn't be inclusive of that coming out of the run rate. So, if you include
– if you exclude PPP, then you're more into a low-single, mid-double digit kind of growth rate. Does that make
sense?

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2021
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I'll just start with that generally lines of credit. We're not seeing a significant increase in lines of credit, but
construction is obviously beefing up some.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I think, Brett, to add to Harold's comment there, I do think it's an interesting line item with high volatility in it when
you get underneath what's going on. So, what I mean by that is this is a market where we've had loans – with the
paydowns are dramatic. We've had loans where you're going to traditionally fund construction loans through – up
to a stabilization period. We've had permanent lenders taking us out before stabilization and even some before
construction completed I believe. And so – again, you've got that extraordinary paydowns in there.
So, some of it when you see the growth in a quarter or two, some of it just had to do what's the volume of
paydowns, the headwinds that you're running against. And there is no doubt that we do have meaningful
construction commitments where there's significant equity in front of us that gets burned through before we get to
the construction funding. So, the emphasis over the last 12, 18, 24 months would not have changed, but it is a
volatile market both in terms of what projects are being done, how much equity is in front of the construction
funding and what the volume of early paydowns is which in my judgment has been extraordinary over the last
year or so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. I appreciate the color there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Brett, one more point on construction, I'm looking at some numbers that aren't in the deck, but construction and
land development funding was 41.5% at June 30 and 42.4% at 9/30. We've got about, call it, $6.6 billion in
exposure, of which $2.8 billion is funded. So, there's quite a bit of headroom in that construction book.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. That's very helpful. I appreciate that, Harold. And then I'm curious just thinking about this whole fintech
thing and you've obviously made some investments. Do you guys think about this more passively in terms of you
think these things are great to invest in and then they might help you from an expertise perspective or tech
perspective or might you get more active in terms of actually building out like your own banking-as-a-service
platform and actually possibly putting fee income from those operations and maybe loans from lenders on your
balance sheet?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I think that the latter is less likely, Brett. I think the motivation for us has been – going back to Harold's comments
about how we got started. We were investing in funds where we knew people and it provided deal flow, deposit
flow, all those sorts of things. It was an important economic for us how we built the business. I think in all the
17

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2021
years our strategy has always been to be a fast bowler from a technological standpoint here, just in terms of what
our business model is and how we deliver services and so forth.
But as you know, over the last decade, the pace of that thing has stepped up significantly. And so, to be a fast
bowler, you got to be in the game and know where stuff is and what's moving and those kinds of thing. And so,
that was – that's really the honey of what we were trying to get to. As I always say, we wouldn't do it just for that
reason. In other words, we're not going to make bad investment so we can watch technology grow, which is
generally fortunate to have friends and partners that we're able to participate with that – that do it well. And it is
helpful to us as we study technology.
And I guess going back to your last point, we are finding some investments there where there are opportunities
for us to utilize those products or for us to introduce some of those product capabilities to other folks that we're
integrated with, as an example like Raymond James, who, as you know that's our brokerage platform. Retail
brokerage platform is the Raymond James. And so, we have opportunities to match them up on things too.
So, anyway, just a long-winded way to say, we wouldn't do it if we thought it was a bad idea but principal
motivation is to stay close to what's going on in fintech. And yes, there likely to be synergistic opportunities, but I
don't think we're headed to a major line item for that sort of fee income.

Okay. That's helpful. And then, last one if I could, just looking at the slide, slide 9 on the revenue producer adds,

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Just wanted to delve into the comments that I think you had, Terry, on the comfort list with the liquidity that's come
in from the PPP program and things like that. It looks like securities to earning assets are about 17%. So just
wanted to get a sense of how much the securities portfolio could continue to grow from here just given that
comfort. And then as we think about next year in light of the expense guidance and the loan growth that you've
guided – that you've given, do you think ex-PPP fees you have the ability to actually drive positive operating
leverage? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I'll start with that the investment securities, as far as growth in securities, I don't believe will add a significant
amount. We are looking at – can – based on what rate curve we're looking – we're anticipating, if we were to
invest over a period of time and, call it, say, a number of $500 million to $1 billion in securities, Michael, can – will
the rate curve respond in such a way that tangible book value doesn't get – for lack of a better word,
[indiscernible] (00:54:21).
So, we are thinking about that. I know some banks have put out there – if the 10-year gets to $1.75 or some
number like that, we don't necessarily have a number like that in mind. But we are studying it and looking at
various alternatives because I think at the core to this whole discussion is whether or not we think these deposits
are going to stick around. And right now, we think these deposits are sticky. There was a lot of discussion over
the last several quarters about surge deposits, but it looks like for our client base these deposits that we've
accumulated over the last year or so look to be hanging in there and will stick around for extended period of time.
I don't know if that's exactly what you were looking for, Michael. If it's not, let me know and I'll try to give you some
more. But that's what we think here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
No. That's helpful. And for the second part of the question, just about operating leverage ex-PPP fees, do you
think that's a possibility just in light of the loan growth and the expense outlook for next year? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. When you're talking to me, I think there's always going to be operating leverage opportunities. I believe
there's significant potential to drive our efficiency ratio down. But if you talk to the CEO, what he believes is he's
got a lot of opportunities out there to hire people. And so, I think where we're at is a 49% to 51% kind of number,
somewhere in that range. And it's been kind of remarkably steady over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. Maybe just as a follow-up just going to BHG, you have another recourse reserve reduction in
this quarter. I think you talked about that getting to about 5.25% by the end of the year. Is that still the plan? And
then as we think about next year some of these other verticals grow, could that reserve ratio actually grow from
that level as those other verticals grow? Thanks.

down into the 5.25% range here by the end of the year. I don't know if it'll get that low. But they believe that they
think it could get down and call it the 4.75-ish, 4.85-ish range by the end of next year.

Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
I wanted to circle back to the margin. We've talked a lot about growth, but not a lot about the margin and wanted
to just think about loan yields. And Harold, my question for you is how close do you think we are at a bottom for
loan yields? I think loan yields ex-PPP and accretable yields around 3.78% this quarter and looks like new yields
are coming out around 3.37%. And so, how do we think about where those two numbers converge and how much
more pressure we have on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think what I'll talk about is loan yields without PPP impact. I think we're getting closer and closer to that –
that bottom. I don't know if we're – I don't think we're there yet. I think we'll still see loan yield dilution here over
the next several quarters. But I don't think it'll be dramatic, Catherine. I think it's a couple of basis points here, a
couple of basis points there. The new lines of business that we're operating in, they tend to be LIBOR pricing now
going to SOFR pricing. So, we're not anticipating any big hit related to that as far as loan yields are concerned.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2021
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
And then just a follow-up on the operating leverage question. So, would it be fair to think about 2022 as a year
where we perhaps don't see positive operating leverage as we just – we likely don't have a big increase in rates
this year and you've got continuing building of your teams and the expense growth? But then as we enter 2023
that's really the year where you really start to see the growth move off of all these hires and hopefully with a
higher rate environment where it will be a lot stronger in 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think that's a fair assessment. I don't see our operating leverage moving one way or the other here over
the next four quarters. And I think this hiring pipeline that Terry talked about earlier has got a significant impact on
that. I think we'll have some branch builds going on next year in some of these markets that we're new to. And I
think that will impact it as well. So, you know from your history with us over the years, we manage our expenses
but we focus on revenues. And we've been fortunate through our history that our operating leverage has been
fairly stable even with these big investments.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Okay. That's great. So, maybe it's kind of stable operating leverage near term and then we see expansion
in 2023, which I think that makes sense. All right. That's all I got. Thank you so much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Thanks, Catherine.

Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Olney with Stephens. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. I want to go back to Michael's question on BHG around that recourse adjustment. What
was the dollar amount of the adjustment in the third quarter? I think it was around $35 million in 2Q, but I don't see
anything specific in the third quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I've talked to Dan McSherry about that earlier today. It was about $35 million again here in the second
quarter – I mean third quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Thanks for that. And it sounds like you expect another adjustment in the fourth quarter. Would you expect it
to be at a similar level as you saw in the 2Q and 3Q?

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2021
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think it probably will be similar, but I'll have to follow up with Dan to find out. But I think you should
probably count on it being similar.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Got it. And just to clarify the outlook for the operating expenses, obviously you mentioned the 8% to 11%
growth next year. Any more color on why operating expenses could be flat to down in the fourth quarter while
you're still hiring elevated number of new producers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Matt, I think our incentives were fully baked on incentives. And I think we'll have probably a little less
incentive expense coming in here in the fourth quarter that'll help kind of neutralize its impact to fourth quarter run
rate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt Olney Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Our next question comes from [ph] Brock Valley with UBS (01:02:27). Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Hey. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Harold, just to follow up on BHG. You mentioned the reserve going
down to about 4.75% maybe in the next year. On the back of that and I think you mentioned this at the Investor
Day, what's the impact as BHG transitions to CECL?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. That's a great question. CECL will come around in 2023 I believe or 2024. And right now, what the experts
have told them is they don't necessarily need to worry about CECL for the loans sold through the pipeline, through
the auction platform. But they will need to adjust for CECL here in the – on balance sheet credit. They're going
through modeling on what that means to them and their business model. But suffice it to say, these loans have an
average life of about 4 years and we'll call it $1.30 or $1.40 kind of charge-off rate that equates to somewhere
around, call it, 5% to 8% reserves.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Got it. Okay. And I think going back to slide 9 and the focus on the revenue producers. What should we be
thinking in terms of just basic math on per producer on average? What do they add in total or in total after three or
four years? How do we kind of break that down just sort of rule of thumb?

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2021
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Harold, you want to take that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. Brock, we've looked at that like Terry's expression earlier in the call, nine ways to Sunday. That typically a
commercial lender on average, based on our hiring kind of metrics over the last, call it, three years, we're looking
at about $60 million loan get from a commercial lender and then somewhere close to that on deposits. So, that's
kind of what we'll use for modeling when we start talking about these new hires that are coming to us from all over
the franchise. Of late, the hires that we've had in equipment finance and franchise lending, we fully anticipate
bigger balances from them.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Got it. And that's – is that within, say, three years, or is that [ph] two times timeframe (01:05:26)?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Harold? You might be on mute, buddy. Brock, I don't know what happened to Harold's connection. The timeline
on that is a five-year number.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Five years? Okay. Great. Thanks for the call, Terry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A

Okay. You bet.

Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Martin with Montgomery Scott. Your line is open.

Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey. Good morning. Hey. I don't know if Harold's back on, Terry, but maybe just the reserve level you guys have
talked about that going lower. Can you just give a sense for how – where do you think that could end up over time
as the economy improves and...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2021
Yeah. I just – I got dropped and now I'm back. Brian, can you repeat the question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah, Harold. I was just wondering on the reserve – the allowance level, just kind of how we think about where
that trends to kind of over time?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. We anticipate, provided everything kind of stays consistent here that we'll continue to see decreases here
over the next several quarters. I don't anticipate any significant change with respect to the absolute change, net
change, quarterly change. So, I think we've probably got more to go, call it, through next year. And it's just the
way our modeling works. So, it's a slow and steady kind of operating mode.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. And currently, that 1.20% level you're at this quarter, Harold. I mean, I guess that's kind of what I was
getting at, would you expect to – that how low could that get to, if we look to where it was pre-pandemic, or I
guess, when you think the next couple of quarters or next 12 months, whatever timeframe you're thinking about?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I don't think we'll get down to day one reserves post CECL.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
We could, but I'm not – we're not planning for that to happen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
So, I think we're looking at all kinds of different scenarios. But right now, we believe that we've got more reserve
release coming probably through the 2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. And how about just going back to your – the margin, Harold, just kind of the core margin outlook. I
mean, if loan yields continue to drift a little bit lower and the funding is in – the funding costs are kind of
24

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2021
approaching the bottom and then net core margin probably goes incrementally lower in the near term. Is that how
to think about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think that's probably an accurate assessment. But again, like I was mentioning to Catherine, I don't think
we're talking about significant bumps. I think we're probably flat to a few basis points.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Got you. Okay. And then maybe just the last two for me, Harold. Just the – with the stickiness of deposits, it
sounds as though we think about the balance sheet is growing modestly from or is it growing from here, maybe
not modestly, but growing from here. Is that how we think about things?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. We're hopeful we don't see $1.3 billion in deposit growth. I know that's not something CFOs like to talk
about. But, yeah, I think we will see continued deposit growth, but I think it'll be more like what maybe it was pre-
pandemic.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah. Okay. And then just on the fee income, Harold, I mean, just kind of trying to put some kind of fence around
these equity investments. I mean, given they were million dollars all of last year and we're almost $20 million year-
to-date. I mean that – if the current level isn't sustainable, I mean there's a – I guess you're probably somewhere
in between – a little bit lower than $8 million a quarter, but some healthy level is sustainable as we go forward
today absent any big adjustments like you saw this quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, we fully anticipate making money off these venture fund investments. Just to give you a little more
detail on it, Brian, we've got about $110 million in [indiscernible] (01:10:13) typical joint venture funds that where
people are out there trying to make investments to hit a big leak. And then we've got another $50 or so million in
CRA venture funds that have kind of a different objective. So the yield, the risk return on the CRA investments is
not nearly as large as, say, the typical the $110 million. So – but we would have a reasonable return target on
both segments of our joint venture fund investments with the typical non-CRE ones being, of course, bigger.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Yeah. Got you. Okay. And then just lastly on the PPP, Harold, the balances of PPP, where you've given kind of
forgiveness you're seeing now, I guess, where do you see the balances of PPP at year-end? And just the – I think
you said that – was it the contribution from PPP revenue is around, you're thinking $12 million for the fourth
quarter?

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 13-Oct-2021
Yeah. Some $12 million to $15 million. We don't know exactly where forgiveness is going to go, but it's
traditionally over the last several quarters, historically it's been running about, call it, 40% down on balances. I'm
talking about the balance sheet every quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. All right. In the revenue side, the $12 million to $15 million. So, okay. That's all I had. Thanks for taking the
questions, guys.
