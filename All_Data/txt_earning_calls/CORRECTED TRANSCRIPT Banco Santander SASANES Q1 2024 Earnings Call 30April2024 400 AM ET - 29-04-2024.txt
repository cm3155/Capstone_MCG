MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Begoña Morenés
Global Head-Investor Relations, Banco Santander SA
Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Banco Santander's Conference Call to discuss our Financial Results
for the First Quarter of 2024. Just as a reminder, both the results report and presentation we will be following
today are available to you on our website.
Let me just highlight that this is the first full quarter in which we are publishing results with our global businesses
as primary reporting, aligned with the way we are managed as we announced late last year. Secondary reporting
will be reduced to be primary until 2023, mainly country reporting, European DCB, et cetera. As we will explain
later, changes versus previous periods are done on constant euros with the exception of Argentina which is
presented in current euros to avoid distortions. All information will be, as always, available in the Excel sheet and
reports that is published in our website. But now to the presentation.
I am joined here today by our CEO, Mr. Héctor Grisi; and our CFO, Mr. José García Cantera. Following their
presentations, we will be opening the floor for any and all questions you may have in the Q&A session. [Operator

And with this, I will hand over to Mr. Grisi. Héctor, the floor is yours.

Thank you, Begoña. Good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us.
First, let me share with you what we'll be focused on today. First, I will talk about our Q1 results on the context of
our strategy. Second, José will then review our financial performance in greater detail. And then I will conclude
with some final messages.
Let's start with Q1. Q1 was another very strong quarter for Santander. Positive contributions for all our
businesses, demonstrating the strength of our strategy and our business model. We are presenting a profit of
€2.9 billion. That's an 11% increase versus Q1 2023, 9% in constant euros. As Begoña said, excluding the impact
of the temporary levy of revenue paid in Spain recorded in full in Q1, if you include that, this was another record
quarter.
Our customer focus and scale are driving profitable growth. Over the last year, we welcomed 5 million new
customers and our revenue in Q1 increased close to double digit year-on-year in constant euros, and that's
supported by all global businesses and the regions.
We're executing on One Transformation plan, which is already supporting efficiency improvements, leading to
growth in profitability and, as a result, our efficiency ratio improved [ph] 153 (00:03:05) percentage points year-on-
year to 42.6%, and net operating income has grown double digit year-on-year for the last eight quarters.
Our return on tangible equity rose 55 basis points year-on-year to 14.9%. Even more, 16.2% if we annualize the
impact of the temporary levy in Spain.

Finally, our solid balance sheet. With sound capital ratios and robust credit quality, it contributed to strong
profitable growth and, more importantly, to shareholder value creation. TNAV plus dividend per share grew by
14% year-on-year from a combination of higher profit, increased shareholder remuneration, and fewer shares due
to the buyback programs we have and we're still executing. In the last 12 months, we increased TNAV by more
than €4.5 billion.
If we take a quick look at our income statement, as we usually do, we present growth both in current euros and in
constant euros, although there were no material differences between them this quarter. Part of the reason is that,
for the first time, the operations in constant euros apply to all countries except to Argentina, which is in current
euros to mitigate distortions from the hyperinflation.
Our P&L was strong from top to bottom, a strong top – number one, strong topline performance driven both by
NII, record fees, supported, as I said, by all the global businesses and regions. Second, revenue grew while cost
remained flattish in real terms, in line with expectations and relatively stable over the last three quarters. Third, we
demonstrated the sustainability of our results with 11% growth in net operating income. Fourth, and loan loss
provisions continue to normalize as expected. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, during the first quarter, we recorded
a €335 million charge related to the temporary levy in Spain, which was 50% higher than in 2023. Excluding this
impact, profit rose 14% year-on-year, implying a growth of 12% in constant euros. José will go into more detail
into these points later on.
As you can see, this is a great start of the year, and we are well on track to achieve our 2024 targets, targets that
we comfortably reiterate. Good business dynamic supported high single-digit revenue growth. Our efficiency ratio
improved even as we're investing for the future through One Transformation, and it is already better than our
target in 2024. Cost of risk remained fairly stable, in line with our target of keeping it around 1.2% at the end of the
year. The fully loaded CET1 ratio remained at 12.3% in Q1, having profitably grown our business organically, and
accrued distributions in line with our 50% payout and we have absorbed regulatory impacts. We are comfortably
in line with our target of keeping it above 12% even after Basel III implementation. And the RoTE grew year-on-
year 16.2%, putting us on track to reach our target of 16% for 2024.
As you can clearly see, we're achieving these results backed by the operational leverage provided by One
Transformation, which is improving both revenue and cost. The efficiencies we have captured and the impact of
our active spread management have already contributed 174 basis points of improvements since 2023.
Our global businesses continued to contribute to the group's profitability and have delivered 88 basis points in
efficiency gains. Our initiatives to better serve our multinational corporates and SMEs through our regional
coverage model continue to grow well with revenue increasing 5% year-on-year.
Finally, our proprietary and unique global technology capabilities have already generated 63 basis points in
efficiency savings so far. Our global approach to technology has allowed us to capture €50 million in additional
savings in Q1 for a total of €237 million since 2022. This has been mainly driven by the deployment of Gravity, by
new global agreements with vendors, and process optimization in operations and implementation of the new
IT&Ops shared-services.
Our business group overview shows that our common operating model supports value creation based on
profitable growth, from the creation of a best-in-class customer experience and operational leverage from our
global platforms and common tech. This is helping us to accelerate the achievement of our Investor Day targets.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2024
This operational leverage is already very evident in our Retail and Consumer businesses for the efficiency ratios
improved close to 400 basis points and 200 basis points year-on-year, respectively. In CIB, we are building a
world-class business, leveraging our areas of expertise to grow our US franchise without changing the risk profile,
proof of which is the revenue which grew 5% and reached another quarterly record supported by the good
performance in the US and strong client flows. Wealth continued to grow strongly, improving both efficiency and
profitability. And finally, in Payments, where we are managing more than 100 million cards worldwide, we are
seeing good activity trends. In Q1 2023, we had a onetime revenue from a commercial agreement with one of our
partners in Brazil. Excluding this impact, revenue grew 7% and efficiency remained flat year-on-year despite our
investment in deploying our global platforms.
Now let's look at each business in greater detail. First, our goal in Retail is to become the number one bank for
our customers, which is key to our strategy. At the same time, our Retail business is a great example that
demonstrates the benefits we are generating from One Transformation, as operational leverage has significantly
improved the efficiency ratio.
First, we continue to innovate to offer the best customer experience. For example, in Spain, our new digital
onboarding is contributing to 630,000 increase in net new customer year-on-year, while Santander Key already
enables more than 4 million customers to approve transactions securely with a single click using biometrics.
Second, we continue to implement a common operating model across our banks, increasing automation to free
up time of our people to focus on commercial activities. As a result, dedication of resources to non-commercial
activities have dropped by 4% in the last nine months.
Third, the deployment of our own global platform continued in Q1, and Gravity is already operational in Spain, the
UK, Chile and the US.
From a financial perspective, this is also a great moment for Retail. We are managing margins very carefully to
make the most of the tailwinds from higher for longer interest rates in Europe and, at the same time, benefit from
our negative sensitivity to interest rates in South America on top of the strong operational leverage that we are
obtaining from One Transformation.
As a result, our profit grew 22% year-on-year, with the following three things to highlight. First, double-digit
revenue increase driven by good performance both in NII and fees with all the regions growing year-on-year,
especially Europe and South America. Second, cost under control, flat in real terms as the benefits from our
transformation in some units are offsetting the impact of inflation on salaries and investments. And third,
provisions dropping slightly with cost of risk fairly stable at the comfortable levels across all the group. The
execution of the strategy is driving profitability improvements with RoTE increasing 3 points to 17.6%.
In Consumer, we are working to become the partner of choice for our customers. We offer best-in-class global
solutions which are integrated to our partners' processes. Last year, we launched a new digital onboarding to pure
[ph] digital (00:09:11) players, which has been received well because it allows our customers to complete their
vehicle acquisition and financing fully online. We're also progressing well on simplification and automation,
supporting a 15 basis points decline on our cost to total volumes ratio. Deploying global platforms is key to scaling
our business, reducing cost to serve and improving profitability. We recently announced the launch of Openbank
in North America this year, which will result in having a national deposit gathering platform for the US.
Consumer is also delivering operational leverage with net operating income growing by 7% year-on-year, driven
by the following three elements. First, an increase in revenue due to positive commercial dynamics with volume
5

growth mainly in Europe and Brazil, good NII performance and 22% fee growth, mainly from insurance. Second,
cost dropped 4% in real terms as a result of execution of our strategy and efficiency plans we implemented last
year in a more complex interest rate environment. Third, provisions increased year-on-year, mainly due to the
expected cost of risk normalization in the business, both in Europe and the US, though still below the historical
averages, as well as from impact from volumes and regulation.
Last year, we started to prioritize profitability over volumes, so we are originating at high RoRWAs. The increase
of volumes and good profitability levels of the new business makes us confident that profit will be growing close to
double digit year-on-year by the end of 2024 even after the normalization we expect on provisions.
As you can see, we are building a world-class CIB business to help our clients that leverages our strengths to
grow profit, while maintaining at the same time the same risk profile and is well under control. We are deepening
our client relationships and increasing our capabilities in the US, building on an areas of expertise to accelerate
growth across all regions. We had a good start of the year and we have a very strong pipeline with markets also
performing strongly across the asset classes. As a result, revenue in CIB in the US grew 35% year-on-year.
Also, we continued expanding and strengthening our centers of expertise, including key industry groups such as
energy transition, healthcare, among others, and product teams such as M&A and ECM. At the same time, active
capital management continue to support greater origination and high profitability levels.
Our business through CIB is capital light, very much linked to customers and with fees growing at a good pace
year-on-year. CIB had a good result in Q1, with revenue up 5% year-on-year even after the record in Q1 in 2023,
making Q1 2024 the best quarter ever for the business. Almost all of our growth came from customer flows and
was mainly supported by strong performances in global markets and global banking, both in global debt finance
and corporate finance. Additionally, we're investing to expand our business to drive additional efficiency gains and
further improve our profitability.
As for Wealth Management and Insurance, we continue our journey to build the best private banking and
insurance manager in both Europe and the Americas. First, in Q1, Euromoney once again named us the Best
Private Bank in LatAm and the Best International Private Bank in eight countries.
Second, a major driver for growth is Wealth is collaboration with other businesses, especially Retail and CIB by
capturing network benefits.
Third, we are developing global platforms across the three businesses, while we digitalize our distribution and
advisory capabilities to improve customer experience and promote growth. One example is the development of
our global investment platform, which we began in Q1 and will enable our clients to manage any kind of
investment across all countries.
In summary, customer experience, efficiency and time to market improvements are accelerating growth, helping
us to maintain our high profitability levels. Attributable profit grew double digit on the back of strong private
banking activity in a favorable interest rate environment, with a total fee contribution from Santander Asset
Management and Insurance growing at or close to double digit, while cost remain fairly stable in real terms. As a
result, efficiency improved 4 points year-on-year and RoTE rose 9 points to 80%.
Finally, Payments. We have a unique position as we are on both sides of the value chain: issuing, where we
manage more than 100 million cards group-wide; and merchant acquiring. We are gaining market share as we
strengthened Getnet's value proposition for customers through continued product development and greater
6

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2024
offering of value-added services. Growth of active merchants has been particularly strong in countries where
Getnet has been mostly rolled out, such as Chile, Spain or Portugal.
We continue to migrate significant volumes of payments to the PagoNxt global platform to leverage on the group's
scale. Around 1 billion annualized transactions are already running through the new global platform, and we
expect to double this volume by the end of the year.
Also, we have started to deploy Plard, our global cards platform. We have more than 45,000 debit cards managed
already in Plard and we're starting the migration of the debit portfolio with 1.5 million cards in dual run in Brazil
and we have launched a friends and family pilot in Chile.
From a financial performance perspective, Payments delivered a strong quarter with good underlying revenue
trends in both businesses, which, combined with a positive performance of provision in Cards, drove 22% year-
on-year profit growth. Finally, PagoNxt EBITDA margin reached 17%, showing good progress towards reaching
our 30% target by 2025 which we set our last Investor Day. Cost efficiency and CapEx optimization will continue
to drive profitability in the coming quarters.
As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the result of our strategy and our strong first quarter is aligned with our
new phase of our shareholder value creation. Q1 has led to outstanding profitability growth and double-digit
shareholder value creation for the fourth consecutive quarter. As I mentioned earlier, RoTE was 16.2% if we
annualize the Spanish bank levy, up 93 basis points year-on-year, reflecting the high levels of new business
profitability.
Earnings per share rose to €0.17, up 14% year-on-year, supported by strong profit generation and the lower
number of shares following the buyback programs we have and are still executing. Finally, in the quarter, we
delivered 14% growth in shareholder value creation, reflecting our disciplined capital allocation and the impact of
the share buybacks. Buybacks continue to be one of the most effective ways to generate value for our
shareholders if we include in full the share buyback that is currently underway, we have bought back around 11%
of our outstanding shares in the last three years, providing a return of investment of approximately 19% to our
shareholders.
I leave you now with José, our CFO, to go in through more detail on our quarterly financial performance. Please,
José.

Thank you, Héctor, and good morning, everyone. I'll go into more detail on the group's P&L and capital
performance. But let me first remember that we are presenting growth rates both in current and constant in euros
and also that the full impact of the Argentine peso devaluation last December for the whole year was accounted
for in the fourth quarter, which introduces some distortions quarter-on-quarter.
Let me also, as Héctor has mentioned, highlight that we are presenting constant – what we present here as
constant is constant, that means local currency for all countries but Argentina. Argentina is in current. By doing
that, we try to avoid the impact of hyperinflation. But also by doing this, we are lowering the growth rates that
show as constant. For instance, net profit, instead of growing 9% with Argentina in constant is growing 13%, NII is
growing 20% instead of 16%, fees would be up 8% instead of 5%, or total revenue would be increasing 12%
instead of 9%.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2024
So we are trying to be transparent and trying to show the underlying performance of our business without taking
into account the impacts of hyperinflation in Argentina. But let me go through the main components of the P&L. As
Héctor said, we are reporting exceptional result for the first quarter. We are starting to see the benefits of our
transformation programs in terms of operating leverage in Retail and Consumer and, obviously, the very positive
momentum we are experiencing in both Europe and Latin America at the same time.
Revenue grew 10%, actually 12% if we only look at customer revenue, supported by strong NII, highest quarterly
fee income in our history, while costs were fairly stable for the third quarter in a row. Net operating income grew
11% year-on-year. Cost of risk remained fairly stable, supported by strong labor markets and risk management.
Provisions increased slightly due to the expected normalization in some countries, but we see no asset quality
pressures anywhere.
Additionally, we had a higher impact from taxes year-on-year, driven mainly by stronger performance in Brazil
where we have higher effective tax rate than the group average, and also the fact that the temporary levy in Spain
is now tax deductible from the corporate tax level. The full impact of this tax levy in Spain is accounted for in the
first quarter and is 50% higher than last year. As you can see on the right-hand side, excluding this impact, profit
would have increased 14% year-on-year or 9% quarter-on-quarter and Q1 would have been another record high.
Let me break down the P&L. Starting with revenue, there was a strong growth driven by customer revenue again
this quarter, which made up more than 95% of our total revenue and explained almost all of the growth in the
quarter. Year-on-year, revenue increased 9% with all businesses and regions contributing. This growth was
primarily supported by our Retail business, which is growing at double-digit rates with good performance in net
interest income and fees across regions, and Consumer driven by our good profitability levels in new businesses
and a strong volume growth in Europe and Latin America.
CIB also had a great performance as revenue reached an all-time high in the quarter, backed by outstanding
performance in the US. We also delivered double-digit revenue growth in Wealth, driven by solid commercial
activity in Private Banking and in Asset Management. Payments is also showing very good underlying trends
year-on-year as both PagoNxt and Cards are growing if we exclude the one-time positive impact recorded in
Brazil in the first quarter of last year, as Héctor has explained. Finally, at the Corporate Centre, high liquidity
buffer remuneration was compensated by the negative impact of FX hedging.
Most of our revenue growth came from NII, which continued growing in the quarter, particularly in Retail and
Consumer, representing 82% of group's NII. It went up 16% year-on-year on the back of active price management
in Retail in Europe, especially deposits, and also in Mexico; and the benefits from the negative sensitivity to rates
in South America both in Retail and Consumer; and the fact that now forward rate curves in Europe are a bit
higher.
In terms of profitability, we have improved net interest margin year-on-year even if we exclude Argentina. This
was mainly explained by higher yields on assets as we actively manage credit spreads to take the most out of our
– of the interest rate environment. These gains from credit yields more than outweighed higher funding costs,
which we were able to contain, thanks to our disciplined deposit remuneration in Europe and deposit repricing
downwards in Brazil, leading to a notable margin expansion. The only country where we saw slight increase in
betas in the quarter was the UK.
Going forward, we expect the positive momentum in Europe to continue, we expect to benefit from the interest
rate cuts in South America, and we expect an improvement in our Consumer business throughout the year,
boosted by high profitability levels of the new origination. As a result, very good NII outlook for the year.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2024
In a context of low fee income growth in general because of subdued loan demand and weaker consumer activity,
we generated record net fee income of €3.2 billion in the quarter even if we exclude Argentina, growing strongly
quarter-on-quarter despite the strong seasonality in Payments in the fourth quarter. We also delivered solid
growth year-on-year, supported by most of our businesses, with Retail growing 9%, driven mostly by higher
activity in Brazil; outstanding performance in consumer fueled by insurance; CIB also growing from very high
levels in the first quarter of last year, especially in the US, on the back of our strong dynamics in DCM and
customer-related markets activity.
Wealth also had a great performance, particularly in Private Banking, higher volumes in Asset Management and
protection businesses – business performance in Insurance. Payments was impacted by the usual seasonality
from Christmas and Black Friday in the fourth quarter and the aforementioned one-time positive fee recorded in
the first quarter of 2023 in Brazil.
In terms of efficiency, significant improvement in our ratio to 42.6%, which remains amongst the best in the sector.
As we have already mentioned, structural savings from our transformation are already becoming evident in terms
of operational leverage, especially in Retail and Consumer, as costs remain stable at around €6.5 billion for the
last three, four quarters. Average inflation continued its gradual decline across our footprint, dropping from 12% a
year ago to 4% in the fourth quarter, and we were able to maintain costs fairly flat in the year in terms of real
terms despite the lagged effects of high inflation on salaries and other costs and our investments in
transformation.
By business, costs remain well under control in Retail, Consumer and Wealth, which represent 75% of our total
cost base; however, total cost rose 5%, reflecting our strategy to reinforce our CIB franchise and develop global
payments platforms. We expect a structural operational leverage from our new operating model to become even
more evident in the coming quarters and years. Credit quality, as I have mentioned, no signs of any pressure in
terms of credit quality which remained robust, with cost of risk fairly flat in the quarter across our footprint, in line
with our expectations.
By global business, credit quality remained stable at low levels in the quarter in Retail, which represents 50% of
the group's loan loss provisions, with sound underlying trends across the different countries. Cost of risk improved
in Spain, remained at very low levels in the UK, while Mexico continued to normalize in line with expectations. In
Consumer which represents around 36% of group's loan loss provisions, cost of risk normalized to 2.12%, also in
line with our expectations but still below the historical average, both in DCB Europe and in the US, which is still 5
percentage points below 2016 levels.
Going forward, we are confident that our cost of risk will remain around 1.2% in 2024 as strengths in Consumer
and Mexico towards more normalized levels are expected to be offset by better performance in Retail, especially
in Brazil, improving mostly in the second half of the year; Spain will be stable; and in the UK that will also remain
at very low levels.
Closing with capital, our fully-loaded capital ratio remained at a very comfortable level of 12.3%, backed by strong
capital generation and significant risk-weighted asset mobilization. This quarter we generated 32 basis points
organically after having absorbed 5 basis points due to the temporary levy in Spain and an increase in risk-
weighted asset density related to a change in mix.
We recorded 22 basis points charge for shareholders' remuneration, in line with our 50% payout. There are also
24 points from regulatory charges related to the maturity measure of CIB models, which is suspected to be

temporary and revert next year with the implementation of Basel III. Finally, there was a 14-basis-point positive
impact mainly related to intangibles and the valuation of available-for-sale portfolios.
We continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and expand our asset mobilization
capabilities to maximize capital productivity. Our disciplined capital allocation is resulting in a new book return on
risk-weighted assets of 2.8% in the quarter, well above that of our back book and higher than last year's. We
created a centralized asset management desk with the aim of optimizing capital deployment.
Last year, we disposed of an amount of capital risk equivalent to €30 billion in risk-weighted assets at a cost of
capital of around half of that of the new origination. Our target this year is to do even more.
That's all from my side. Héctor, over to you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, José. First of all, a quick reminder. We continue to make good progress towards the targets we set for
2025, thanks to our unique business model and the execution of the strategy with, first, an strong and increasing
organic capital generation and execution of our capital allocation plans; second, we continued improving our
profitability. Investor Day target, just to remember you, was 15% to 17% RoTE. And by growing both profit and
profitability sustainably, we have been able to deliver 14% value creation.
And a summary to finish off. Q1 2024 was another strong quarter, supported by a recurrent customer revenue
growing high single digit, backed by strong performance in all our businesses and regions. Our structural change
to a simpler and more integrated model is driving the efficient improvement and profitable growth, which is
essentially evident in Retail and Consumer.
Our rock solid balance sheet and robust credit quality are contributing to growth and double-digit shareholder
value creation. This is very strong Q1 2024. We are confident that we will achieve our 2024 targets as well as
those we gave on our Investor Day in 2025, supported by – first of all, it's important to acknowledge, that is
supported by our global businesses and we continue executing on One Transformation.
From a revenue perspective, we expect good NII performance in the year. This is based on, first, the positive
momentum in Europe which will continue at least another quarter; second, enjoying the benefits from the interest
rate cuts in South America; and third, the significant improvements in Consumer boosted by the high new
business profitability.
The benefits of the operational leverage from One Transformation program are expected to become even more
evident during the rest of the year and well into 2025. Cost of risk is expected to be contained and in line with our
expectations in a context of strong labor markets. As we deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities,
the group's RoTE improved from 16.2% in Q1 2024 and we expect it to remain at 16%, in line with our targets for
2024. All in all, our TNAV plus cash dividend is growing double-digit, well on track to meet our target through the
cycle.
And now we would be happy to take your questions. Thank you.

Thank you, Héctor; and thank you, José. We can start the Q&A session now.
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We already have the first question from the line of Francisco
Riquel from Alantra. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Francisco Riquel Q
Analyst, Alantra Equities Sociedad de Valores SA
Yes. Thank you for taking my questions. First is on NII in Spain, which has surprised positively and we have seen
local peers raising guidance, so I wonder if you can update on your guidance for 2024 and detail the main
assumptions behind it. And then how big uplift shall we expect in 2025 with the current yield curve? Also
connected to this, the NII in the Corporate Centre, because the Spanish liquidity, I understand is [ph] second
rated (00:32:35) rate here, so you can provide any comment to better assess the combined NII performance of
Spain and the Corporate Centre.
And my second question is on capital after the 20 bps front-loaded in first quarter from Basel IV. You mentioned in
the past that, 30 bps left for January 1, 2025, so meaning that you are already in line with the 12% pro forma post
Basel IV. I wonder if you can update on this Basel IV regulatory impact and other headwinds that we should
expect, and what do you see your CET1 target in the context also of potential countercyclical buffers? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Francisco. Let me explain exactly how do we see NII basically going in Spain. First of all, I mean, we
see really good trends, as you can see in Retail, due to the fact that we had really good growth in clients' side,
basically talk about 630,000 net new clients in just one year. And the trend continues basically very positive
during the first quarter as well, which we can – basically have been able to add 130,000 new clients.
It's important to say, and as I commented, that we see this continued trend also on the interest rates towards the
second quarter to continue to grow. All the different business basically are doing quite well, as you can see. I
mean, CIB is also performing quite well and the Commercial business, too, and that will basically give you the
idea that we expect to have a very strong 2024 all along in NII in Spain. In terms of the Corporate Centre, of what
we see there on capital, I will ask basically...

Thank you, Héctor. Let me complement Héctor's comments. With the current forward rates, as Héctor said, we
see NII still up in the second quarter, basically flat in the third and a bit down in the fourth. This would lead to NII
11

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2024
in Spain year-on-year up low single digits. Remember that we expected NII in Spain to drop a bit year-on-year in
2024 relative to 2023. With the current level of interest rates and forward rates, we see actually NII up in Spain
year-on-year.
In the Corporate Centre, the first quarter is a bit abnormal because we increased the hedging. We always try to
hedge at the beginning of the year based on our expectations for the different currencies, so I would expect the
NII in the Corporate Centre to gradually perform better as future FX charges might be lower. Capital, Basel III, let
me make a general comment before I go into Basel III. There are a few elements – well, several elements of
uncertainty to European banks' capital and capital requirements in the coming quarters.
The first is the US has stated that it will not implement FRTB for the time being and that they will analyze the
proposed Basel III rules to avoid having any unexpected impacts. It is, therefore, very likely that both the FRTB
and the Basel III rules in the US will be quite different from the initial proposals. Europe needs to react to this
because this will put European banks at a profound competitive disadvantage.
It is not unlikely though that the Commission will make use of its delegated act to postpone the implementation of
FRTB beyond January 1, 2025; however, we don't think CRR is going to change. In addition, the EBA needs to
publish 140 technical papers to interpret the new directive, capital directive. The EBA mandate is that in
aggregate, the impact of all these papers must be neutral, but that doesn't guarantee that everyone and all these
papers will be neutral themselves. This is the case, for instance, in the paper presented for consultation on
advanced operational risk model calculation.
So, all in all, with the information we have today, we maintain our estimate for a very low day one impact of Basel
III, so on January 1 the impact will be very low, 0 to 20 basis points; and a fully-loaded impact of between 30 to 50
basis points as we had commented before. So, all in all, we would expect to be above 12% fully-loaded and
phase in once Basel III comes into effect.
Countercyclical buffers, if in Spain, in Spain we have approximately 25% of our risk-weighted assets for the group
so any countercyclical buffer will have a quarter of that amount impact on capital for the group. So if it's 50, it will
be 12 basis points; if it's 100 basis points, it will be 25 basis points. Remember, however, that from the time
countercyclical buffers are announced to the time they're implemented, there is a one-year lag. So any
announcement will not impact capital requirements for a year, most likely will not impact 2025 capital
requirements or they might impact year-end capital requirements in 2025 but not 2024.

Ignacio Ulargui Q
Analyst, BNP Paribas Exane
Hi. Good morning. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, if I may. The first one is
on fees. Fee generation in the quarter was quite good. When looking to the coming quarters, what should we
expect? Should we expect an acceleration of growth driven by the good performance of CIB and Wealth
12

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2024
Management and Insurance? Linked to this, I just wanted to see if there was any kind of one-off in the fees
reported in the US which jumped a lot quarter-on-quarter?
The second question is a bit linked to the capital debate and I just wanted to better understand what is the organic
generation that you expect. I mean, as profitability improves, I feel that a 10 to 15 bps [ph] is supposed (00:39:08)
to be a bit below and you could probably generate a bit more, or you would devote that to additional growth of that
revenue base? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Ignacio. Okay, in terms of fee generation, okay, we have, as you can see, I mean, a strong Q1, 14%
quarter-on-quarter. That's an 18% quarter-on-quarter growth in Retail, Retail represents basically half of the
quarterly growth, and is basically solid Commercial activity in all the regions and it's continued to do so, okay.
You talk about the outstanding performance in CIB. That's 39% quarter-on-quarter, that's a record revenue. This
is basically what we've been doing in global transactional banking and there is no one-offs whatsoever in all the
bank and in the US. It's basically business as usual and client flow from more accounts, okay.
In Wealth, we have also a very strong recurring activity in Private Banking, also we have higher volumes in Asset
Management, and as well in the Insurance business, we have a – see a very good trend. And probably we see a
very good trend coming from Brazil towards the end of the year that could help us out, okay. Consumer growth
came mainly from Europe, okay, volumes grew and also the insurance fees recovered in Europe and that shall
help us as well.
For 2024, we expect that trend to continue, as I told you. The fees are growing to reach mid- to high-single-digit.
This is not an official target but I can tell you that this is the trend that we see. This is mostly driven by the
increase in CIB, with the connectivity we have on Wealth and Payments and the growth in customer
transactionality. And most of the global businesses will experience double-digit fee growth in 2024 as we change
our business model and we concentrate on the principality of the account. It's very important to understand what
the model change is about.
The model change is exactly about that. When I was talking about to become the number one bank to our clients,
this goes more to transactionality and fees than RWA consumption as we used to do in the past, okay. So this is
the basic change that we're executing today. So you're going to see a much better trend towards that and the
most disciplined part on the allocation of RWAs. With that then, I leave the capital question to José. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Hello, Ignacio. Our organic capital generation post dividends is around 15 basis points per quarter. We think we
can keep risk-weighted assets fairly flat throughout the year, very, very low risk-weighted asset consumption
because of the asset rotation initiatives that I mentioned. So we should be able to have available for capital
growth or regulatory headwinds 15 bps per quarter the next three quarters.
We still expect 20 to 30 basis points of additional regulatory requirements and some positive contributions for
intangibles and intangible management. So net-net, with all of that, we still see 12.40% to 12.50% capital ratio by
year end.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alvaro Serrano Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
Hi. Good morning. I've got kind of a couple of follow-up questions. Héctor, you gave details on the fee
performance. I just want to circle back to US again and Brazil. In the US, so I know you said there's no one-offs,
but is this the run rate we should expect going forward? How's the pipeline looking? I realize there's no one-offs
but there may be seasonality. And can you repeat – you mentioned in Brazil, there was a renegotiation in
PagoNxt, I suspect that's why the fees have been lower but if you could repeat that?
And then the second question on NII, if you think through your comments on Spain, can I invite you to comment
on Brazil and UK? Brazil, obviously, very, very strong, it sounds like above the sensitivity you gave. What do you
expect for the full year, can it continue strong? And on UK, just when do you think it can bottom? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Alvaro. Yes, as I explained you, the performance in the US is quite good. And, look, we have a very
strong pipeline, and if the markets are there and we're able to execute everything that we have, I think we will
have a very good trend. But as you know, that will all depend, I mean, how the market basically goes. But what I
can tell you is that the market is basically helping us out in that sense and we will continue the trend if the markets
helps us, sorry to repeat myself.
Looking at – in Brazil is exactly that you were saying, I mean, we had a one-off in Payments that we had on the
first quarter last year which is not going to repeat itself. It was a big one, €95 million, so that basically slowed us a
little bit. But I see the trend quite well in the sense that I see Payments growing nice and I also see that Retail is
helping us out also in the growth. And what I saw towards the end of the year, we see that if we continue that
trend, that should help us well in Insurance, in Retail, so that will help us as well, okay. So I see pretty good
trends in that sense and the trends that they will continue to be strong.
In terms of NII in the Spain, Brazil and the UK, I could tell you that the indications we gave at the beginning is that
with – if the rates continue the way they are, this is going to give us a – I mean, first of all, see the volume growth
that we have in Brazil, so it's important to understand, and the volume growth is coming from Payments and from
Retail mainly. And NII in Spain, already José gave you a very good explanation but I will allow José to go deep
into the detail on that one.
In terms of the UK, let me go real fast to tell you what the trend is. I mean, as you have been seeing, the UK basic
– will behave the same as our competitors are behaving, okay. The business, as you know, is very focused on
Retail, is our core business, and we continue to improve there the offering and the user experience. And we also
are gradually continuing to growing and investing in the Corporate segment and Wealth to try to diversify away
from Retail, okay.
NII down 4.4% in the quarter, similar as I said to the other UK banks, and all the big ones have the similar trends
of [ph] RoTEs (00:46:24) but we're taking actions to improve the NII. We're doing pricing changes, we're –
14

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2024
announced both deposits and lendings in the first quarter and we'll – trying to reduce the betas and to manage
them in a much better way. And asset mortgage spreads also are improving the UK market, so that shall help us
towards the next quarter so it wouldn't be as negative as we expected in the beginning of the year.
And then, we are also executing cost control efforts to help us on that. That is basically the main part that you're
going to see in the UK. And the cost of risk is basically where you will – I mean, under control and we expect it to
be very much there. So with that, I'll ask José to basically give you more details in terms of Spain and Brazil NII.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. So in Brazil, NII should gradually accelerate towards the second half of the year. That means that year-on-
year, we should see mid- to high double digits – teens, not double-digits, teens growth in NII. And in the UK, the
performance for the rest of the year should be similar than the one we saw in the first quarter. As Héctor said,
we've seen a pickup in volumes; margins, customer margins were flat quarter-on-quarter, so year-on-year for the
full year, NII down a little bit mid-single-digits, something like that.
With all of these estimates, we believe NII for the group should grow quarter-on-quarter this year, so sequentially,
we should see higher NII every quarter this year. And year-on-year, customer revenue – we've talked about fees
and the strong performance in fees, so year-on-year customer revenue should be very close to double-digit in
2024 relative to 2023.

Ignacio Cerezo Q
Analyst, UBS AG (London Branch)
Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. There are two both on the US. I don't think I've seen the
slide you used to have in last quarter around the kind of aspirational 15% RoTE target in the US, so if you can
kind of update us basically on how quickly you think you can get to that number and what the main drivers and the
main initiatives. I've seen Openbank being launched in the US recently, so just a little bit of color basically on how
quickly you can get to that.
And the second one is on the asset quality in the US. I mean, you used to give some information around [ph] EVs
(00:49:08) charge-offs in the past as well. I don't think I've seen those actually, so forgive me if I missed them but
if you can give us a little bit of underlying color of how the US asset quality delinquencies on the auto businesses
are developing from here? Thank you.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2024
Thank you, Ignacio. Okay. In terms of the US, a particular thing is first of all, I mean, as you know, we've been
investing quite heavily on that market basically to concentrate ourselves in the most important businesses, which
is Consumer on one side, okay, which is a business that we have at scale. We have also expanded a little money
on the CIB side to beef up our presence there, and we're also investing to become – our Private Banking, our
Wealth Management capabilities, to do it in a domestic way due to the fact that today we are just basically for
non-US aliens, okay.
So those are the things that we're investing in the US to take it to a 15% RoTE and where I believe is going to be
more towards the end of 2025 that we're going to be able to get there but still we're working really hard in order to
be able to complete that. In terms of the asset quality on the US, let me explain exactly how the trend is.
First of all, we still see a strong labor market in the US, okay, and the behavior of the portfolio continues to do
very well. What is been happening is that we continue to see the trends in delinquencies above 90 days behave
much better than pre-COVID. That remember, pre-COVID was about 90%, we went all the way down to 59%,
today is more around close to – in between mid-60s, okay, and it continues to be like that.
So, as you can see, our cost of risk in the US has been pretty stable around the same levels and we expect it to
continue to be like that towards the end of the year. We don't see any surprises and the way the portfolio has
behaved, okay. So circa around 2%, that's where I see it. And now what we have done also is very much focus on
profitability. We're – been very strong on capital allocation and we see that the origination that is coming through
is quite good. And also we are focusing of credit quality and the mix of the portfolio continues to sustain itself in –
around 40% prime and near-prime, okay. So you see the portfolio very stable and in that level. Thank you.

Carlos Peixoto Q
Analyst, Caixabank BPI
Yes. Hi, good morning. So the first question would actually be on the US, on the outlook for NII, how do you see it
evolving throughout the year? Should we expect pressure to continue or should – or could we also see a recovery
trend in there? And then second question, and sorry if you answered it before because I'm not sure you did, on
the cost of risk in the UK, it remains at quite low levels. Do you see this picking up throughout the year or should
we see the first Q level something recurring throughout the year? Thank you very much.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Sorry. Thank you, Carlos. First of all, on the outlook of NII in the US, I see it flattish, okay. Let's see how volumes
basically turn out, and as I explained before, it seems we are very much focused on profitability. And also in
capital allocation, I see that is going to be flattish, around there, okay. And in terms of cost of risk in the UK...

...in the UK, sorry, the cost of risk in the UK, as I told you before when I was explaining Alvaro, I see the – very
flattish. I mean, the guidance is going to be at around 11 to 14 basis points at the most. So below 2% – sorry,
below 20 basis points, sorry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
If I may add, as I've said, we see no asset quality pressures anywhere. Labor markets are very strong and new
employment, new job creation is also very strong everywhere. So we see really no pressure, there's no signs of
asset quality deterioration, so we could extrapolate – what we've seen in recent quarters in the UK, we could
extrapolate for the rest of the year.

Operator: From Marta Sanchez Romero from Citi. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marta Sanchez Romero Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
Thank you very much. Good morning. My first question is on capital. So if the Bank of Spain were to introduce the
[ph] CCIB (00:54:28) of 100 bps, that is 25 bps for you, but that would leave your 12% fully-loaded core equity
Tier 1 ratio leaving – or implying an MDA buffer of just about 177 basis points, which is pretty low for European
standards, so do you think that 12% fully-loaded core equity Tier 1 ratio target is still the right one in that event?
The second question is on the UK. So the bottom line is now 25% smaller than last year. Is the shrinking going to
continue, or do you think you can stabilize earnings at current levels? And just quickly, a clarification on a
previous question. The revenue growth that you are foreseeing, is that just reported revenues and is that in
constant or current euros? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Let me answer your final question. We are estimating almost or around double-digit revenue growth in constant
euros with Argentina in current euros. Obviously, in current euros or in euros with Argentina in constant maybe
higher than that. But as I explained, we believe this is the best reflection of our underlying performance
eliminating the distortions of hyperinflation in Argentina.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
In terms of capital, what I can tell you is basically that exactly as I said, I reiterate that we're going to end up the
year at around 12.40% to 12.50%, okay? And I really do believe – I actually reiterate that we're going to be above
12% after Basel III. I believe that would be the main point...

being decided by the board. The board might review the capital target once the variables that led to that capital
target might change, but we are going to be comfortably above 200 basis points MDA with our actual capital

Britta Schmidt Q
Analyst, Autonomous
Yeah. Hi there. Thanks for taking my questions. I've got two questions. You sound more optimistic on net interest
income in Spain, UK and Brazil. But, look, there's been no change to the official group targets for 2024. What is
the delta here and what do you think is the biggest delta to consensus?
And then, secondly, you guided to double-digit customer revenue growth and the group revenue target at mid-
single digit. What's the delta here for 2024? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
First, as we saw in the first quarter, just the monetary adjustment in Argentina in the first quarter was [ph] just
€100 million (00:57:38). We have €1.2 billion monetary position in Argentina and inflation was 51% in the first
quarter. So just that in the first quarter was €600 million. That's what we are trying to avoid by looking at constant.
So there are charges to the P&L that obviously we don't control. So that's the reason why we haven't changed the
revenue target for – I mean, the total revenue target for the group, mid-single digits. But we believe that the
customer revenue growth can approach – can be close to double digits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Britta, in terms of the revenue overall, as you were saying on NII, yes, I sound optimistic because I'm very
optimistic of the trends that we have in front of us. And I reiterate that we're going to meet the 16% RoTE that we
basically have announced. Onwards, I believe that is a – it looks good and it looks promising, but I reiterate the
guidance that we have gave you.

Sofie Peterzens Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Yeah. Hi. Here is Sofie from JPMorgan. Thanks very much for taking my question. So I was just wondering about
the flat cost guidance for 2024. Does it still hold? Your costs are up 5% in constant euros, 7% in current euros. So
how should we think about that cost guidance that you previously gave?
And then my second question would be on rate sensitivity 100 basis point change in rates. If you could just
remind us what that means for Spain, Brazil, the UK, your – or the core markets? And also, if you have any
hedging in place to reduce that rate sensitivity?
And then my final question would be, on slide 5, you say that your new – you only got 5 million new customers
year-on-year. But the Investor Day a year ago, you targeted, I think, 75 million new customers. Just like a
strategic question. Maybe it doesn't make a difference if you only have 5 million new customers or does it make a
difference? And how do you plan to get to the 75 million new customers that you guided for at the Investor Day a
year ago? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Sofie. Let me answer you the last question first. I mean, what we've been doing here is basically, we
are cleaning up a lot of our customer bases. And even though we are growing quite hard, we've been cleaning up
that, and basically, that's at the end what's going to be telling – I mean, moving up towards the number of
customers that we are able to include. We're going to be working on that. And both, I mean, the growth of
customers basically is very strong in all different areas and in all different businesses.
In terms of the cost, I was basically, as I explained you, I mean, these remain fairly stable for the third quarter in a
row, okay, as you have seen, thus plus 1% quarter-on-quarter. If you exclude Argentina, that's minus 3% because
Argentina is moving the numbers up and down. That's plus 2% year-on-year in real terms, and thus, the cost to
income at around 42.6% and this is on track to our 2024 target of below 43% cost to income. And I believe that
we're going to be able to get to that.
Cost efficiencies are just coming from operating leverage through simplification of products. If you see the amount
of products that we have simplificated, we have 10,000 different products. Today, we're down to 7,500, and
automation, which is a very important part. And I was just explaining you in the change of model how are we
changing the non-commercial FTEs to commercial FTEs and this is something that, in time, will help us to control
cost much better than we've been doing, okay? That's basically the efficiency gains.
If you look at that, simplification gave us 17 basis points year-on-year of savings. Automation is helping us out.
58% of product services are now digitally available, okay? That's 2 percentage points in [ph] Wealth (01:02:16)
versus December 2023. And if I can tell you an example, the US have captured €10 million in efficiencies just in
Q1 alone, and that's €210 million since we started the process in 2022 and that you're seeing in Consumer and
Retail.
So it's very important that we also remember that One Transformation is not a merely cost-cutting exercise for the
creation of the single model and with the several other benefits. And this trend will continue on and on, helping us
out as we change completely the model of the way we operate the bank, okay? So, to rate the rate is basically to
tell you that we're going to be in our target below the 43% cost to income for the rest of the year.

José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Now, in terms of rate sensitivity, there hasn't been any change in all countries, in most countries but Europe. Let
me – in euros. Let me explain. So in the US, it's plus/minus €150 million; in Brazil, plus/minus €150 million; in the
UK is plus/minus €200 million. But we have reduced the sensitivity in euros in Spain, in particular, significantly.
Let me make first one particular comment about the UK.
Our structural hedge in the UK is £113 billion with an average duration of £2.4 billion. It was £106 billion in
December, so £113 billion, 2.4 years average duration. And in Spain, we have been hedging our balance sheet
through a combination of different actions, basically originating at – adjusting the origination, buying ALCO
portfolio. We now have €30 billion ALCO in Spain at an average duration of between 6 to 7 years at 3.25% yield,
and we have been also writing some hedges.
The result of that is that of the €240 billion risk-weighted assets – €250 billion, €250 billion average earning assets
we have in Spain, 60% is floating, 40% is fixed. That's significantly higher fixed portion than before. So now we
have now lower sensitivity to rates in Europe.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Sorry, Sofie. Just to be more precise, what I was saying is the cost to income is going to be below 43%, okay?
That's efficiency that we have set for the year and we reiterate that, and efficiency this quarter was 42.6%, okay?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
So let me just finish. The NII sensitivity compared to the average of the major competitors we have in Spain has
been reduced to 7.5% compared to their sensitivity at 5%. We expect to continue hedging the balance sheet as
we – in the future. Obviously, the decision to do this gradually has proven to be good in the sense that rates,
curve rates, interest rates, curves have picked up a bit. So that has allowed us to earn higher NII and also more
time to hedge the positions. But again, we are gradually hedging our interest rate sensitivity in euros, reducing
duration through the combination of all these actions that we've taken.

Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?

Operator: Next question from Andrea Filtri from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.

Andrea Filtri Q
Analyst, Mediobanca SpA (United Kingdom)
Thank you for taking my questions. The first is on your profitability targets. Your above 16% RoTE guidance for
2024 implies more than €12.4 billion net profit this year with Q1 on track to hit that and with tailwinds in H2 that
you indicated in Brazil and the UK replicating portfolio and then consumer with lower rates. Can you be more
specific about your profit target for this year and give us an insight on the 2025 out of the outlook?
Second question, if you could give us a target for 2024 group cost in absolute million euros and where do you see
them going in 2025?

Finally, a quick one on the insurance business. The new package, banking package improved, the treatment of
insurance activities inside banks. Could you consider internalizing this business? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Andrea. You're right. I mean, we are confident that we are going to reach the 16% target that we set in
terms of RoTE for the year. And we said correctly in our Investor Day, we said 15% to 17% towards 2025. And we
are working towards that and we are working very hard in order to be able to do it. But today, I reiterate to you
that we're going to be at the 16% RoTE that we have set, okay?
In terms of cost, what we have said is basically around less than 43% in the terms of cost to income. If you see
the numbers that we have been, we've been very disciplined in terms of – and what we have said, I mean, if you
said it – is you saw is quarter-on-quarter is around 1% drop and we're going to be very disciplined about it.
And if you see the operational leverage that we have on the – on what I presented on Retail, you'll see that the
operational leverage is working like that, okay? So our target is basically to maintain cost the way it is, and I
believe that the trend would continue like this. So I feel very confident on the way we're managing things and I
believe that we could be able to reach and to be more or less flattish in terms of cost.
The question of insurance is quite a good one. We love the business. We believe that we have huge upside,
mainly in markets such as Spain and in Brazil, I could tell you, Mexico where insurance penetration is quite low.
So we see huge opportunities on that and we continue to better up our systems. For example, we are simplifying
products in that sense in a very important way.
Today, average by market, we have 222 different products per market. The idea is basically to go down to 25
basic products that I believe that would help us in order to be much more concentrated for our teams to be able to
sell to the client exactly what they expect and to continue a really good trend. So that's a huge opportunity, as you
say.
The other side of the coin is that we have JVs that in place on the long-term basis, mainly in Latin America and in
Spain and Portugal, and that we will continue to have them over the years because they are long term. I would
love to internalize that business, but unfortunately, it is what it is. We have the JVs and we need to respect what
we have there. But as you say, these are huge opportunity in that sense, not just because of the change and [ph]
sweetness (01:09:57) in regulation, but also because of the advantages and that we have given the amount of
customers that we have and the low penetration in the different markets.

Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?

Operator: Benjamin Toms from RBC. Please go ahead.

Benjamin Toms Q
Analyst, RBC Europe Ltd.
Thank you for taking my questions. At the full-year results, you noted that you do not expect any material impact
from the FCA's review of Motor Finance in the UK. And since then, one of the large banks in the UK has made a
significant provision in respect to that issue. Do you expect that no material impact here, and are there any
numbers you can provide us with how to frame the issue?
And then, secondly, we've seen consolidation in the space in the UK from banks looking to improve their return
profiles. Are you already in the UK slightly below that of your major peers despite a favorable asset mix. Do you
believe you can improve returns in this geography using only organic methods? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you. I mean, first of all, on the UK Motor Finance issue, I mean, the resolution of such matters, as you
know, is not possible to predict. There are some significant uncertainties that remained with regards to the
existence, the scope and the timing of any possible outcome there. So, as a result, we're not yet in a position to
disclose the extent of any potential impact, and I don't believe until basically, this – I understand there is an expert
basically running through that. So I don't believe that we can give you an idea. What I can tell you is that, so far,
we're doing well in the sense of the settlements that we have. And so far, we've been doing better than we
expected.
In terms of consolidation in the UK, I don't see that we should play in the consolidation at this point. I don't believe
that that's a market that we should invest more at this point. That would be my view in that sense.

Operator: Next question from Chris Hallam from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Hallam Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs International
Yeah. Good morning, everybody. So two from me. So first on Basel IV and then on Argentina. So José, thanks for
the color earlier on Basel IV. I mean, I suppose it sounds very possible that FRTB gets pushed to align with a
revised US timeframe, let's say, towards July 1, 2026. And you mentioned the delegated act provision for FRTB
here in Europe. So just within your day one and fully loaded guidance, how much is FRTB and how much is all
the rest of it, i.e., if we only get parts of Basel IV on January 1, 2025, and then FRTB follows on July 1, 2026, how
much would that change the phasing of the capital headwinds you talked about earlier?
And then second on Argentina. So clearly, it has quite a distortive effects on the group figures. And then there's
the associated cost of hedging and it's below 5% of group earnings. So I just wondered whether you've
reassessed your footprint plans in Argentina, I guess, especially in light of the announcement that one of your
22

peers is exiting that market, or are there any sort of interconnectivity with other parts of the group that would make
such an exit uneconomic?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
So you asked a different question, yeah, when – we've always mentioned Basel III, but when we gave the
impacts, we were including FRTB, you're right. So when we said day one impact of Basel III was Basel III plus
FRTB, FRTB isolated is 10 basis points. So if FRTB gets postponed, we will not have this 10 basis point impact
on day one that we were accounting for in our estimates. I hope this clarifies the matter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you. In terms of Argentina, I think that we need to leave our options open given what's going on. If
Argentina, basically, can sustain what's going and we try to be positive about what would happen, I don't believe
that we have no downside but upside given the situation. So there are no plans to do anything at this point. And
we'll just wait and we will continue operating our business. Our business is doing well, is very well-structured, is
one of the best banks that we have in terms of client penetration, in terms of the transactionality that we have
from our clients, fee generation. So we will continue to be there and see what our options are later on.

Operator: The last question comes from the line of Andrea Filtri from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrea Filtri Q
Analyst, Mediobanca SpA (United Kingdom)
Yes. Thank you. Just having a second go, asking for absolute numbers on your net profit guidance for 2024, the
16% RoTE implies over €12.3 billion. Can you be more specific about what number you're actually targeting? And
then on the cost, the same story, I'm asking for a nominal euro-denominated group cost target for 2024? Thank
you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you. Sufficient numbers and growth rates in the P&L to really estimate what we believe is our most likely
figure for net income and cost. So again, for net income, 13% – sorry, 16% return on tangible equity gives you a
figure in line with what you are saying, around €12 billion – north of €12 billion, it's what – it's the conclusion of the
16%. We agree with that. And in terms of costs, we're looking at a cost growth, which is going to be around 2%
this year to 2.5% this year.
Going forward, as we've discussed, we are targeting flat cost in absolute terms going forward. That is going to be
difficult. Obviously, we are still in a relatively high inflationary environment. We believe that will – it is a very
ambitious target, but that's the internal target we have. We haven't given any guidance for 2025, but what I'm
saying is that long, medium term, our target is to keep cost flat or down in absolute terms. We are not there yet in
2024, close. We think we could be closer or there in 2025, but it's too early. We are still in early 2023 – sorry,
23

2024. So we'll give you this guidance in due course. But again, our medium-, long-term objective is to keep cost
flat or down in absolute terms.
