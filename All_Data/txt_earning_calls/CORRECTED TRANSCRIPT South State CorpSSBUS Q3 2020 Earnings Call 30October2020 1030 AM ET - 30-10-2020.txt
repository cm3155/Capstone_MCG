Robert R. Hill Jr.
Executive Chairman, South State Corp.
Good morning and thank you for being with us. I'm excited to be with you today and excited for you to hear from
John and Will about the progress the team is making in building South State. This CenterState South State
partnership was about the long-term, but you can clearly see the progress being made in the short-term, progress
with technology, products, efficiency, all which have us uniquely positioned for the long-term. But most
importantly, it's about having a great team, which we are fortunate to have, and are continuing to build. Our board
and our management team are united around the opportunities that are ahead of us. And our culture is growing in
a healthy way that will only make us stronger in years to come.
John Corbett's leadership along this journey has been excellent. And I will now turn the call over to John for more
insight into the quarter.

John C. Corbett
Chief Executive Officer & Director, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Thanks, Robert. Good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are doing well. In light of the challenging
environment, I couldn't be happier with the progress our team is making and the financial results that we're
producing. It was a solid quarter.
Adjusting for merger costs, the company produced diluted earnings per share of $1.58 for a 17% return on
tangible equity. Our pre-provision net revenue grew to $170 million for a pre-provision return on assets of 1.8%
and tangible book value per share grew at an annualized rate over 15%.
The highlight for the quarter was clearly the profitability of our mortgage and correspondent banking units. We
heavily invested in these fee-based businesses when treasury rates fell after the 2016 Brexit vote. And now, four
years later, these non-interest income lines of businesses are producing a healthy return on investment.
Two weeks ago, we announced another investment into our correspondent banking division with the acquisition of
a broker-dealer based in Memphis, Tennessee. Duncan-Williams is a 51-year old family firm, led by the son of the
founder. And it's the perfect complement to the fixed income line of business that we've been building for over a
decade.
South State currently serves nearly 700 community banks nationwide and Duncan-Williams adds an additional
250 financial institutions to our coverage universe. This was a negotiated transaction that Steve Young and Brad
Jones have been pursuing for a year and a half and we are very excited to welcome Duncan and his team to
South State.
While fee income has been remarkably strong, we continue to be faced with industry-wide loan growth and
margin headwinds as we navigate through the pandemic. The good news is that our loan pipeline bottomed out in
August and is steadily rising every week. The pipeline is now 24% higher than the low in August and it continues
to grow as our clients become more confident in the future.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2020
Asset quality metrics improved considerably during the quarter, with loan deferrals declining to just 2% of loans.
Of the 2% of loans currently on deferral, half of those are, in fact, making their interest payments, so really only
1% of loans are in full principal and interest deferral. And this is the second quarter in a row that we recorded only
1 basis point in charge-offs.
As for the merger integration, it's proceeding on time and on budget, and the encouraging thing to me is that the
merger integration isn't slowing our forward momentum in the rest of the bank. I can definitely feel the South State
team leaning forward and eager to go on offense to prove what this new franchise is capable of.
One area where we continue to improve is the South State digital experience. This month under the leadership of
Renee Brooks, we rolled out our new website, and next month, we roll out a new mobile banking app that has
been in the works for over a year. Our team is excited to offer a mobile app that rivals the largest banks in the
country for customer functionality and convenience.
To pay for these digital investments, we will be downsizing our branch network by 20 braches this quarter, which
reduces our branch footprint from 305 branches currently to 285 by year-end, which also increases our average
deposits per branch to over $100 million, and that's up from $40 million a decade ago.
We're also excited about the huge opportunities that are presenting themselves to recruit the very best
relationship managers from the largest banks in the southeast. South State now has the scale, technology and
capital markets platform to be the logical alternative for middle-market bankers looking to make a change away
from the turmoil at the largest banks.
So when I step back and I think about our positioning and the environment that we're operating in, there are
things that we can control and there are things that we cannot control. We can't control the path or duration of the
COVID virus and we can't control the shape of the yield curve. What we can control is the $80 million of cost
savings to be achieved through a merger and branch consolidation initiatives.
We can also control our investments into the future investments, investments in technology, investments in our
mortgage and correspondent banking teams that are not dependent on the interest spread. And finally, we can
make investments in top notch relationship managers in the best growth markets in the country.
So as I think about where this franchise is headed, I'm confident we're making the right strategic moves to create
value for our owners, our team and our communities over the next decade.
And finally, along those lines, I'm happy to share the news that South State has created a new executive level
position of Director of Corporate Stewardship. LaDawn Jones, a 21 year veteran of our company, has accepted
the invitation to lead our company's diversity initiatives, our college recruiting and management training, as well as
our ESG community development and employee assistance programs.
Everyone at South State is excited for LaDawn and his new role and eager to support his leadership as we create
a company culture that will be a source of pride for all of us in the years ahead.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Will to provide more color on the numbers.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2020
Thanks, John. Our net interest margin was 3.22% on a taxable equivalent basis, down 2 basis points from Q2.
Given the June merger closing date and associated purchase accounting marks and pre-closing security sales on
the Legacy CenterState side, the second quarter NIM is not entirely an apples to apples comparison, nor is the
combined business basis margin of 3.38% from Q2, as it includes the unmarked CenterState balance sheet and
income statement for the 68 days of the second quarter prior to closing.
Our margin continues to be negatively impacted by the significant liquidity we're carrying, $4.4 billion average for
the third quarter. If we were to reduce our balance sheet cash and fed funds sold to $1 billion, reducing deposit
funding accordingly, our NIM would be approximately 24 basis points higher.
Loan yields of 4.35% were up 10 basis points from Q2, reflecting a full quarter of the CenterState loan portfolio
and the company. Accretion was $22 million for the quarter and core NIM, excluding loan accretion, was 2.95%.
As noted on page 6 of the release, we had some measurement period adjustments as we finalized purchase
accounting marks, including a reduction in the loan discount of $29 million. While this improved capital, I'll remind
you that it will reduce future accretion accordingly.
Our loan repricing mix is 55% fixed, 25% floating and 20% adjustable. Our total cost of deposits continues to
improve down to 20 basis points for the quarter. Our CDs are relatively short, with 19% coming due in Q4,
another 32% in the first half of 2021 and 26% in the second half of 2021.
On non-interest income, we had a record $115 million in quarterly non-interest income, led by our mortgage and
correspondent banking capital markets. Our mortgage team has done a really outstanding job in the midst of a
merger of two mortgage teams as well as the pandemic, with record volume of $1.57 billion, 60% of which was
purchased, and strong margins, resulting in $48 million in revenue. Our correspondent banking division continues
to show strong results with a $26 million a quarter.
And on that note, I'd like to echo John's welcome to the Duncan-Williams team. We're not disclosing transaction
terms due to the size of this acquisition, but we're excited about Duncan and his group joining Brad Jones and his
team and helping us grow this business as well as the help it should provide in a very low interest rate
environment. Steve has responsibility for these non-interest income businesses and is available to answer
questions on them during the Q&A session.
On expenses, our NIE for the quarter was $237 million, including $22 million in merger-related expenses for an
operating NIE of $215 million. Our efficiency ratio was 55.8%, excluding the merger-related expenses.
Our expenses for the quarter came in a little better than we expected, in part, because we have begun to realize
some of the merger cost saves thus far a little faster than expected through a normal employee turnover and
some departure of employees who will not be retained, as well as certain vendor savings.
We expect that this cost save realization number will continue to increase each quarter, with the bulk of the
savings coming in 2021, particularly Q3 after system conversion. Additionally, our expenses for a number of items
were down in Q3 due to COVID. Business development, loan related and ORE expenses, travel expenses, and to
some extent, health insurance costs were all down due to COVID, but we would expect many of these to
normalize once we're beyond the health crisis.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2020
So the Q3 run rate for several areas is lower than we would expect in a normal non-COVID environment. On
merger-related expenses, we have recognized approximately half of the estimated $205 million to-date, some of
which occurred on the CenterState side pre-closing.
Turning to credit, our net charge-offs remained very low at $594,000 for the quarter or 1 basis point annualized.
Ending NPAs were 33 basis points of assets, down 5 basis points from Q2 due to a combination of payoffs and
upgrades. Our provision for credit losses was $29.8 million for the quarter, $22.1 million of which was for the
reserve for unfunded commitments liability.
After running two separate legacy bank CECL models and combining the results in Q2, we consolidated onto one
model in the third quarter and this consolidation of the legacy South State loans onto a different model resulted in
the increase in the reserve for unfunded commitments.
For economic assumptions, we use the Moody's baseline forecast. That forecast has the unemployment rate for
the South Atlantic region holding at 8.2% for Q3 and Q4 of this year before starting to decrease in 2021 with a
forecast of 7.4% at year-end 2021 and 5.4% at year-end 2022.
With a provision expense of almost $30 million and net charge-offs of less than $1 million, our reserve coverage,
excluding PPP loans, grew to 211 basis points, including the reserve for unfunded commitments or 192 basis
points just including the reserve for funded loans. This brings the allowance to NPLs to just under 4 times.
Slide 8 outlines our loss absorption capacity ratio, which ended the quarter at 258 basis points. As John said our
deferrals reduced significantly since our last update, dropping below 2% at October 23. Additionally, our full P&I
deferrals were only 1% of that date as almost half of the deferrals are paying interest.
For the effective tax rate, our return to profitability in Q3 after the impact of the double count provision and other
merger expenses in Q2 caused our effective tax rate to decline in the third quarter to 19.6% from the second
quarter's 22.6%.
Turning to capital, with good profitability and a flat, though, still somewhat inflated balance sheet, our capital ratios
grew during the quarter. Our TCE ratio grew 27 basis points, ending at 7.83%. Our CET1 and total risk-based
ratios grew by approximately 80 basis points and 100 basis points, respectively, ending at 11.5% and 13.9%. Our
ending tangible book value per share was just shy of $40 at $39.83, up $1.50 from Q2 and up $1.63 from the year
ago quarter.
I'll turn it back to you, John.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] [Operator
Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Rose with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey, good morning, everyone. And thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to just circle back to expense as well.
You guys had obviously some really good revenue generation this quarter and the expenses were down. I
understand some of it is COVID-related. But can you just help us, from a run rate perspective, as the economy
continues to reopen, hopefully, what are some of the specific add-backs we should think about? And if you can
just remind us how much of the cost saves – I'm sorry, if I missed it, how much of the cost saves so far you've
actually realized? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corporation
Sure, Michael. We would – on the latter part of the question, we would estimate that thus far, we have recognized,
on an annualized basis, run rate about 12% to 13% of the $80 million of cost saves, so call that $2.5 million for a
quarter. I think in the quarter, like I said, we had – we don't have people out there doing business development
efforts. So there's a lot less travel going on. There's not much real estate foreclosure activity in those related
expenses and professional expenses associated with that. Those areas are all down. And I think for a lot of us are
not going to the doctor like we as often as we had. So we're seeing a little bit of decline in health insurance.
And I'd say all of those items combined relative to a more normalized quarter might be $5 million or so in a quarter
roughly. And then, so that's why I just wanted to be clear that while we're pleased that NIE was down to $215
million, this is an unusual environment and didn't want to people over interpret that as they look forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
That's very helpful. And then maybe just switching to the core margin, 2.95%, I know there's some moving parts in
there, first full quarter, post-integration. As we think about going forward, I mean, are there other areas that you
guys are working on to kind of optimize the balance sheet? And then, how does that relate to the ability to prevent
or limit NIM compression from here? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corporation
Sure, Michael. It's Steve. Let me just kind of talk about a little bit in the broader context around revenue. We
talked about – on page 18 we have a slide in the deck that talks about our revenue composition over the past four
quarters. And what you see in there is the revenue composition has changed. A year ago, we were about 77%
NIM, 23% fees. Now, we're 30% fees, 70% NIM. So just wanted to draw your attention to that.
Our reported margin, as Will mentioned, was 3.22%, our core margin at 2.95%. Just a couple of things on that.
We are core deposit funded bank in great markets. Our checking accounts make up 54% of deposits and our total
cost of deposits this quarter was actually 20 basis points. So we continue to grow low cost deposits on our retail,
7

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2020
our small business and our treasury platform. But from a margin perspective, we don't have a lot of room to
reduce costs, but we will go as low as we can without cutting at the core.
Let me kind of speak through the components of margin. First, on the – yield on the loan portfolio, ex PPP and
accretion, this quarter was 4.16%.We're putting new loan production yields this quarter in that $353 million. So
that continues to be a headwind. As it relates to Will's comment on the excess liquidity, so we have about $4.4
billion of average fed funds sold, it's probably about $3 billion over a target. It weighed on our margin about 24
basis points this quarter.
If you look at our – pre-merger, our total investment portfolio was right about $4 billion or around 12% of assets.
Right prior to close, we sold $1 billion of the CenterState portfolio because it was going to be mark-to-market,
around 1.25%. So as we think about the future of that excess liquidity, we invested about $0.5 billion this quarter
to get it to around $3.5 billion. We're likely on a path to get it closer to $4 billion by the end of the year. And then,
medium-term, our target for the investment portfolio is around 12% of assets. That'll depend upon liquidity. It'll
depend on yield curve. But we also want to make sure that we're not investing a bunch of capital in the lowest rate
environment we've seen. So we are cautious on that, particularly as the non-interest income businesses have
been performing.
One last comment on the securities portfolio, it was at 1.63% this quarter and we're adding purchases somewhere
1.25%. So that would be the core margin comments. The only other comment was on accretion. I think we had
$22.4 million this quarter. Of course, that was elevated. We'd expect that to decrease from here. We have a
disclosure in the earnings release that shows there's about $110 million of discount left on the acquired loans.
So with that, why I don't I turn it over to Will, if he have any other comments there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corporation
Yeah. I think I just would reiterate a couple of things to make sure that we emphasize. And one is just the
reminder Steve gave about, the marking of the CenterState portfolio in Q2 and the impacts we had. So, you
basically had a couple of billion dollar bond portfolio, half of which is sold and turned into cash at 10 basis points
and half of which you had to mark down to a yield of about half of what it was earning before. So that's the impact.
But the second is probably more important and that is just our long-term focus and trying to make sure the
decisions we make are ones that we're going to like for the long-term. It would certainly be easy to [ph] boost
(00:22:21) earnings a bit if we took that excess cash of $3 billion and invested it to pick up 110 basis points, 120
basis points over where we are earning today at the fed. But we want to be thoughtful and do that over time and
not get aggressive and then regret that nine months or a year down the road, if rates have moved back up. So
we'll be thoughtful about pulling that lever, although it does exist.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. All that color is helpful. So I think the way to read that is maybe core margin ex PPP and ex accretion
income, probably going to see some pressure here, but you guys are making some investments. The loan
portfolio and the pipelines that you mentioned will continue to grow. So maybe we get to a point where NII actually
troughs on a core basis, ex PPP and accretion, sometime next year and then starts to build from there. Is that
kind of the messaging and the way to think about it?

Stephen Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corporation
And Michael, this is Steve. I think that's a fair way. I think the tailwind will be any of our investment purchases, the
headwind is the loan book until it gets closer to par. And with elections and COVID and all those, the yields are
going to move around a lot, but that's how we're thinking about it.

Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Good morning, everyone.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Hi Steven.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Morning. So maybe just want to get some clarification on the expenses. I want to make sure I heard it correctly.
On the branch reductions, it sounds as though that's incremental to the cost saves related to the deal, but that
more or less it's going to get. We won't see net savings due to investments in digital and other technology
investments. Is that correct? I kind of interpret that right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corporation
Yes. Steven, I think John can elaborate further. But it's hard to separate out between the merger cost saves we
have as well as the additional investments we're making in digital and the branch reduction. And so we – our $80
million goal includes all three of those, both the reduction in expenses from the branch reductions as well as the
additional investments we're making in improving our technology. And really, it's more of a reallocation of the
branch rationalization into the digital spend would be the way I would probably describe it. John, you may have
some better comments.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2020
Perfect. And then, how would we think about maybe, I don't know, a variable comp percentage on mortgage?
With mortgage being so elevated, how do we think about maybe how that's represented in salaries kind of in this
quarter and the quarters to come? Assuming that does kind of trickle down maybe with MBA forecasts next year,
how we can think about the impact on salaries and maybe efficiency ratio that you think about in that business on
a variable basis?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corporation
Yeah. Why don't I start and Steve, maybe you can comment on the efficiency ratio side. So two components to
compensation expense and mortgage, obviously, one is the staff to get all of the loans through the system and
that, obviously, the need for support staff in an environment like this is greater than it is in a lower volume
environment. But with respect to the variable comp associated with the mortgages, accounting guidance dictates
that you offset against the revenue. So it's FAS 91. So the cost of originating that loan, i.e. the commission, is a
revenue offset and again, [indiscernible] (00:26:15) margin. Now, I will admit to you that not – we've looked at all
our peers, not everyone does it the exact same way, but we do it that way. And that's the way we understand the
accounting guidance from the time we spent discussing with a number of accounting firms. So that's a component
that probably lacks some comparability when you look at other companies – some other companies, I should say.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corporation
Yeah. And Steven, I'd just – to your point, mortgage for the industry had a great quarter. We are really super
proud of our group, the integration of those teams, [ph] Tom, Brent and Stephen's (00:26:53) leadership. They're
just doing a great job of integrating this team. So the production was very large, but the gain on sale is very large.
So if you think about efficiency ratios, I would expect that, over time, that margin, which are a record at every
company right now, would move back toward 3%, even though the production, as we think about these historical
levels, may move back 20%, 25% over time. Yeah, hopefully that kind of helps guide you through. The efficiency
obviously is really good right now, because the margins are so large, the margins will come in and our volume will
come down a little bit.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. Okay. And then, just maybe last one for me, as it pertains to growth and maybe this is kind of a John
question, but maybe also someone else. It looks like there was maybe a big migration from the acquired book into
the non-acquired book, I'm just – or maybe not and maybe if you can comment on that, the big reduction in
acquired, non-credit impaired. And then just kind of with the pipeline's building, how you think about net growth in
this environment, which obviously is a little tenuous still at best, I guess, I should say? So just kind of commentary
there would be helpful.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Yeah. I'll comment on the first question and Will chime in to clean up my accounting knowledge. But I think,
Steven, you talked about a decline in the acquired book and a rise in the non-acquired book, I mean, remember
how this works. The acquired book only runs off. You never had to it. So all of the CenterState loans that came in
under the fair market value accounting, they only decline. And all of the loans that are being generated by both
South State and Legacy CenterState, all of that goes into non-acquired. So I think you'll continue to see that mix
where one portfolio is going down, the other one is going to have to see outsized growth because now it's got
double the production.

But from a growth standpoint, we've had a pretty volatile two quarters here, so hard to be precise in forecasting,
but let me see if I can unpack the components for you a little bit here. And I think it's important to separate the
commercial portfolio from the residential portfolio and I'll start with the residential. If you look at our residential and
home equity book at the end of the second quarter, we saw $150 million decline. So it annualized out to like 10%.
Well, on the same token, we had a record residential production of $1.6 billion. So we had $150 million run-off,
but yet we produced $1.6 billion. Well, the economics as Steve mention of this gain on sale being at 4% is just
unprecedented. So it really doesn't make sense for, us from an ALCO perspective, to put on 30-year fixed rate
loans on our books at 2.75%. The right thing to do for ALCO standpoint, the right thing to do for our clients is to
move those loans to the secondary market. So that has been a headwind, residential to our loan portfolio, but it's
not been a headwind to the income statement in totality.
On the commercial side, the way I'd have you think about that is recognize that a commercial loan pipeline is a
90-day pipeline, so loans you close in the third quarter are typically loans where they enter the pipeline in the
second quarter. So what was the pipeline in the second quarter was dead. So it's not – it doesn't surprise us that
total commercial portfolio would be down in the third quarter.
But having said that, within the commercial portfolio, we were encouraged that we were up, the C&I portfolio was
up during the quarter and owner occupied commercial real estate was up in the quarter. So it's important to think
about those components. But as you think forward about the pipeline, the pipeline is climbing now between $100
million and $200 million a week. And let me step back and put it in perspective for you.
Pre-COVID at the end of the first quarter, the pipeline was $3.4 billion. We hit a low in August at $2.4 billion. Since
that low in August, the pipeline's back up to $3 billion. So a 24% increase in the pipeline and we're feeling good
that that's going to translate into the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year into increased production.
Don't think it's going to be any kind of rapid growth in the loan portfolio, but I think we will turn the corner and start
seeing some modest growth.

Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Just wondering, on correspondent banking, given the strength – the full quarter impact of that coming in and the
business doing well, but also the acquisition that you guys announced. Just curious what – how sustainable you
view that pace of revenues going forward, just any kind of seasonal or cyclical forces we should be aware of? But
also, with the deal, are there other bolt-on deals like this you guys are looking at in that area? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corporation
Sure. Thank you, Kevin. This is Steve. One of the things I'd just remind us, I mean, that we really like the
diversification of these fee income businesses. If you think about mortgage correspondent capital markets and
wealth, none of those businesses make up over more than 12% of our total revenue. So we like the diversification
within each line.
As it relates to the correspondent group, if you look at the trailing 12 months under Brad's leadership, the division
has done about $105 million or so of revenue. If you look at the components of that, about $20 million of it is in
fixed income, about $80 million in our capital markets product and $5 million in payments. So as you think about
the future, I would think that the record year of $80 million in our capital markets business, likely with loan volume
and the industry being where probably will be next year, we'd expect that to come off a little bit, call it 20%, 25%,
just like mortgage probably will.
But just to go into Duncan-Williams. As we talked about already, Duncan Williams has about 250 financial
institution clients. You put that with our 700. That's about 1,000 financial institutions. Last year, in 2019, Duncan
reported about $27 million in revenue. And just from a modeling perspective, as we model the deal, we typically
try to run these non-capital intensive businesses around the 75% efficiency ratio business. So hopefully, that's
helpful in your modeling.
So if you think about the pluses and minuses going into next year, I think you're going to see some of the capital
markets activity likely decline a little bit, but with the opportunity to increase relative to our fixed income
opportunity with our own group as well as Duncan-Williams and the replacement of revenue there. And then I
think, long-term, I think we're just excited to see the synergies between the two teams as we have products and
services from both groups that eventually we can cross sell into it. Clearly, that's not going to happen in the next
six months, but that's the long-term approach. So, hopefully, that's helpful for you.

Kevin Patrick Fitzsimmons Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
That's great, Steve, thanks. Appreciate that color. Just one other broader question about reserve build. I
appreciate all the detail at – the level you've taken the reserve ratio to and then more broadly, when you look at
loss absorption, as you guys are describing it. So that being said, if net charge-offs are staying low as they are
12

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2020
and we don't get any real big change in some of the economic indicators for your CECL model, should we
assume reserve build is mostly in the rear view for you guys? Or is it – if we still think there are losses coming, it's
just they're not coming yet. They maybe will be later next year. It still may make sense for you all to incrementally
build in the next few quarters. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corporation
Yeah. Kevin, I'll start, and if Dan or anybody else wants to jump in and they'd certainly do so. But the thing about
CECL, of course, and it's interesting that we all implemented this new life of loan model, life of – and shortly
before hitting this pandemic. But the theory behind it is that we reserve fully for the economic forecast the losses
that would be driven by these economic forecast and lost drivers in your model over that forecast period, in which
case that theory would tell you that today you've got every dollar in your reserve that you need, and that should be
true of everyone who's adopted CECL, absent a change in that forecast.
So forecasting from there, if the economic forecasts don't worsen, then our reserves should be adequate. Now,
there's a lot of cloudiness to the crystal ball right now with what appears to be increases in COVID cases and who
knows what that's going to do to some of the forecasts of unemployment and other loss drivers going forward. But
sitting today, the way the CECL model is supposed to work, we should be fine. I mentioned in my comments the
model change. So given the timing of our closing, we had to do really a sum of the parts methodology for June 30.
You couldn't really convert over to a new model and go through the model validation process before then. And so
when we did consolidate this quarter, that's what drove the majority of the provision expense. The $22 million of it
was based on the different methodology for the reserve unfunded commitments. So absent that, the quarter's
provision expense would have been $6 million or $7 million. In terms a loss validation, Dan, you might want to
comment sort of on Kevin's question about where we think losses in the industry are heading in the future.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel E. Bockhorst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Yeah. Just from a future loss perspective, the last two quarters have been very good from a charge-off
perspective and I don't anticipate any material change in that here in the fourth quarter. It's more first, second,
third quarter, depending upon how kind of the pandemic plays out and what impact that may have in the future on
credit. But right now, NPAs, charge-offs, et cetera, credit looks strong.

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Want to follow-up on the asset quality. You mentioned in your slide deck that classifieds increase this quarter.
Can you just give us a little bit of color around the categories that drove that increase this quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Dan, do you want to take that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel E. Bockhorst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Yeah. Dan Bockhorst, I'll take that question. The pandemic credit economic headwinds, that put a lot of loans on
deferral in Q2 and Q3. And as good risk managers, we did a comprehensive review with the credit administrators
and market presidents in August of all of our loans over $1 million that were either in high-risk categories were on
deferral. As a result of this review, we made changes to the risk rating grades so that we could ensure that we
have the appropriate allowance and also acknowledge the impact that the economic headwinds have had on
some of the borrowers. Clearly, there is more stress in the hotel book across the entire industry. And so that's
what's driving these numbers primarily and make up the majority of the classified and criticize, recognizing the
headwinds there. The severity of any loss is mitigated by the approximate 5% PCD mark on the legacy
CenterState Bank loans, plus the overall 55% LTV in the hotel portfolio. From where we are today, if the economy
continues this rate a recovery or we don't anticipate any material change in the level of criticizer are classified
assets in the immediate future quarters?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. And on the hotel book, any kind of update on what you're seeing in some of your properties in terms of
occupancy rates? And maybe kind of the difference between what you saw this past quarter in your coastal
properties versus some of your metro markets?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daniel E. Bockhorst A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Yeah. The hotel bookings is performing better than we anticipated. About two-thirds of the portfolio is in leisure
segment, vacation areas, coastal, waterways that are destinations within driving distance of a large segment of
the Southeast population. And the summer was fairly good. Occupancy levels in those categories exceeded 60%
and in some cases were greater than 80%. So when you combine that with deferrals and the PPP funds, so with
this improved performance allowed a lot of these borrowers to stabilize and build some liquidity as well as they've
adjusted expenses to better operate in this environment.
The business segment, which makes up about one-third, has seen occupancy levels typically in the low to mid-
50% range, some might be a little bit lower. Those are the ones that are struggling a little bit more and have a little
bit more headwinds.

Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, very helpful. And then, maybe one other question on just big picture capital thoughts. A lot of banks are
starting to talk about buybacks. I don't think many banks of your size will start buybacks this year. But how are
you thinking about what you're looking for to be able to start to think about reengaging in the buyback activity as
we move into next year? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Hey, Catherine. It's John. Maybe I can comment and Will, feel free to chime in. A lot of uncertainty this summer,
plus in our situation, we're putting two large balance sheets together. I wanted to see where this capital ratio
shook out. We did raise some sub-debt in the second quarter of the year to bolster the capital position.
If you look at us, we look pretty good relative to our peers on CET1 and total risk-based capital. The one ratio
that's a little bit lower is tangible common equity. I think it ended the quarter around 7.8%. If we keep profitability
somewhere where it's at today, that should exceed 8% headed into 2021.
So if credit is as benign in 2021, as we're feeling like it might be now, that having that extra capital, getting TCE
back above 8%, I feel like it gives us some optionality to look at a buyback. Right now, the dividend, I think it's
yielding about 3%. We're paying back about a third of the earnings. I feel pretty good where the dividend is, but I
think that the growing capital base, capital formation is going to give us some options going into 2021.

William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corporation
Morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
I just wanted to circle back on the expenses real quick. So appreciate the $5 million or so in business
development that sort of not in the quarterly run rate right now, but – and correct me if I'm wrong. Theoretically,
that should have also been somewhat missing from the 2Q sort of pro forma run rate of $225 million, just given
the world was still lockdown at that point or just coming out of a lockdown.
And so I guess it's still really good cost savings. You mentioned the $2.5 million or so from the SSB CSFL sort of
cost savings. And so, I guess was there anything else that you all sort of did that drove the larger sort of reduction
in expenses this quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corporation
So, Brody, its Will. Let me clean up a little bit just to make sure. So that $5 million I mentioned, that was more
than just business development. It was included ORE loan-related, foreclosure related, all those kind of expenses
and included professional fee reductions, not all related sort of activity levels being lighter. And I will say on the
business develop – and that's – but this is Q2 versus Q3. And I think part of this – Q2 you probably have some Q1
expenses, i.e. employee credit card or stuff like that that are – those bills are received and paid in Q2. So that's
probably a little bit of noise there.
In terms – so the full $5 million was not business development, just to be clear on that. I would say, Q2 had
probably a little higher expenses associated with our COVID reaction, just getting things geared up in terms of
responding with our facilities and things like that. So that was a little bit of a – I think that would be a decline from
Q2 to Q3. But I just – my comments were just to try to give you a little more clarity on, it feels to me like $215
million is not a permanent run rate, given the unusual environment in which we're operating in. And if we move
back to a more normalized environment, we're going to be out calling on customers. Greg Lapointe and his team
are going to be hitting the road and spending some money on the business development side. Foreclosure
activity is going to come back [ph] in an industry some (00:47:11) expense. We'll spend a little more money on
that. So I just – I kind of want to just make sure that idea was out there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
And I'd just add to that. I mean we shared in the deck the combined business basis, the expenses there. And if
you think about, sometimes our fee revenue businesses move these expenses up and down on the variable side.
Our revenue was up on the fee income by about, I think, $6 million – $6.5 million. A lot of that related to an MSR
adjustment.
16


South State Corp.
(SSB) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2020 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2020
So if you think about the variability of the fee income, that really [ph] was it (00:47:46) from a commission
perspective, much difference in quarter two and quarter three. So the quarter two expenses would be, on a
combined basis, outside of our cost saves, would be pretty reflective of the run rate where we're at.
So sometimes the fee income does move that around a little bit, but really in the third quarter, it did not. So
hopefully that helpful commentary too.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. All right. Understood. Thank you for that. And then on PPP, I think you've mentioned that you have $2.4
billion still on the balance sheet. I wanted to get a sense for the timing of that? But then also, could you – I don't
know if you've looked at this at all, but do you have any sense for how much of those deposits are still sitting on
the balance sheet?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corporation
I'll start by saying, Brody, that with respect to PPP, our crystal ball is probably more cloudy than some of the other
commentary I've heard folks give, but what I'll say what we know. We have about 20% of our loans in the
forgiveness process [indiscernible] (00:48:53) forgiveness process. During the quarter, we recognized about $8.5
million of the net fees – PPP fee, leaving us about $53 million – $53.3, I think, remaining at the end of the quarter.
It is really hard to tell when that forgiveness process will really kick into gear, how quickly the SBA will respond,
will there be another bill passed post-election that may include some sort of forgiveness. But I would say, our
rough expectation with all those qualifiers is you're probably looking at a Q1 and Q2 concentration. And I don't
know at this point whether it's more heavily in Q1 or Q2, but that would be our best guess today. I don't have a
figure for you on how much of those deposits are still on the balance. That's a good question. But John or Steve
may have a feel for that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corporation
Yeah. Brody, this is Steve. I'd just point, we don't know the exact answer, but I mean it's pretty obvious when you
look at the big picture on page 19 of the deck, which shows the deposits from the first quarter to the second
quarter. And what you see is $4.2 billion deposit growth there, and that's when all the PPP money was going out
and were flat from there. So the way I would characterize it as, yeah, the deposit from those companies, although
we don't have a specific answer, really haven't spread out yet and our deposits are flat after that big ramp in Q2.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay, understood. I guess I'm just trying to think about the potential deployment of excess liquidity. And so you've
got $3 billion and sort of excess liquidity like you said on the balance sheet. But I guess just thinking about the
deployment of that either into loans or securities throughout 2021, I guess, as those PPP deposits flow out, I
guess, that would sort of flow out with it. Or do you – I guess, do you estimate that you sort of have excess
liquidity still on the balance sheet that can be deployed into earning assets beyond the PPP deposits?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corporation
Yeah. Brody, I think the answer is we don't know. I think what our target – if you look at our companies as
separate companies, we ran our investment portfolios 12% of assets. That's how we've traditionally done it. When
17


South State Corp.
(SSB) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2020 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2020
we had a lot of excess liquidity in the financial crisis, we probably ran it closer to 15%. But I think right now, we're
in the wait and see mode. We need to build the securities book back up to that medium term 12% number and
then see where the landscape is and see how those PPP funds, because I do think it's uncertain and we just want
to be thoughtful as we do it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corporation
Okay. And I would add, I would say, Steve, I would also just add to that that while certainly a portion of the excess
liquidity is PPP, it's also just the liquidity that the Fed has pumped into the economy. And some of those PPP loan
fundings have been used to pay payroll and things like that. But I think there's just an excessive amount of
liquidity that's with us right now based on the actions the Fed has taken over and above the PPP.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay, understood. And on Duncan-Williams, thanks for giving the $27 million in revenue last year, just want to get
a sense for their business has, I guess, been negatively impacted this year as a result of COVID or how they've
been faring year-to-date?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corporation
Yeah. We won't give those public numbers, but just I'll talk about our fixed income business. Our fixed income
business is up this year and it's really primarily because there's just more excess liquidity sitting in the financial
space. So as you think about all the excess liquidity we're talking about, it needs to be invested at some point, so
do our clients. And so I think even though financial institutions like ours have been pretty hesitant to go too fast on
this, at some point, next year or the year after, you'll start seeing that deployed. So I think this is another good
business to be in the hedging with because I think the fixed income revenue probably be a little stronger than that,
but it's probably too early to tell.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then the $110 million or so in loan discount. Is that the total discount or is there something else beyond
to that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corporation
That's the total.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And so just wanted to ask, so it was $22.4 million in PAA loan accretion income this quarter. I guess just
thinking about the quarterly run rate moving forward, understood that it's supposed to step down, but what should
the quarterly run rate on PAA look like perhaps for 4Q? And when do you sort of expect those loan discounts to
be fully accreted into income?

Will, you want to take that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corporation
Well, I was hoping you would, Steve. I'm chuckling really. I hope you understand why. If you'd asked me three
months ago, I would not have come – I would not have guessed $22 million. It's just a hard number to predict
based upon when payoffs occur, pay downs occur and things like that. But it's clearly going to – it should decline
from here. And you model it over the weighted average life of that portfolio, but then the weighted average life
ends up being – in my experience, over years of acquisitions, always ends up being shorter than what you had
modeled.
But if I were to throw out a number for you, I would worry that I would be doing that number with more precision
than would be appropriate, given the difficulty. But if you know – the best way to do is just model whatever you
think the weighted average life would be for that acquired portfolio and that would sort of guide you to a number.
But I wish I could give you a better number, but I really don't feel comfortable doing so.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Do you know the weighted average life off the top of your head?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corporation
I do not actually. I don't. But the type of lending we do – and again, this would be from origination date. The type
of lending we do, you generally think about it being that three or five year range. But...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corporation
Yeah. Will, I'd say, for the CenterState book, prior to merger, it was around 3.3 years was the average life. So I
think that is probably a decent point.

Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Thank you for the color on the problem assets on the prior calls. I just want to drill
down to the kind of classified and criticized trends just to understand. Do you see a path where those loans get
upgraded in the next couple of quarters or do you think it's going to be more sort of stagnant for a while, get more
visibility on the recession, COVID, et cetera, and then those will migrate back later?

Yeah. This is Daniel Bockhorst. I think a little bit of combination of both. I do think there's an opportunity for some
of those classified loans to get upgraded sooner than later. And then the ones that are in that criticized category,
probably a little bit maybe longer path, a six months to nine months, to see those start to get upgraded as we get
a little bit more visibility. But I don't anticipate those to also – I don't anticipate those to migrate and get
downgraded.

point?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William E. Matthews A
Chief Financial Officer, South State Corporation
The fact that it hasn't really been a conversation in any of our various risk meetings or whatnot would lead me to
answer, Chris, that it's really not a factor for us. And I'll knock on some wood as I say that, but I think we've built
some pretty good processes and had involvement of the local teams, which is a strength of our company
throughout that process. So hopefully, we would be less subject to that than others. I don't think we've seen much
of that. John or Steve, do you have a – and Dan, do you all have a better answer?

Good morning.

I think all the topics have really been covered, but I'll ask one more. You announced another 20 branches you're
cutting. Can you just talk about your willingness to reduce more branches or corporate real estate that's not
currently planned right now in order to offset revenue challenges, should there be any?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Yeah, Jennifer, it's John. With our merger, there really wasn't branch overlap. So I think both companies in the
past have acquired a lot of banks with branch overlap and we've put branches together. But setting that aside,
there is this secular trend. And I think you're seeing this history with both companies that each year looking to
rationalize branch network. In fact, if you go back over the last decade, there's a slide page 20 of that deck. If you
take the two companies, put them together, there were about 85 branches a decade ago. We've acquired 420
branches, but we've consolidated 212. So we've consolidated about half of everything that we've purchased. So
this has been an ongoing trend and we think that that will continue to be an ongoing trend. You've heard other
folks talk, Jennifer, about the COVID driving more and more digital adoption.
Interesting, we opened all of our branches in the company this month. They've been closed for, I think, since
March. So call it six months that the office has been closed. We opened this month. I've talked to some of the
presidents and said, well, now that we're open, what's happened with the traffic inside? They said, remarkably
slow, that customers have become accustomed to doing business in the drive thru, doing business digitally and
they are – the traffic has not picked up considerably in the lobbies now that we're open.
On the digital side, just some stats for you, year-over-year, digital deposits are up 67%. A year ago, this is people
taking a picture of their check on their telephone. We were doing about 15% of our deposits [ph] and right now it's
(01:01:10) 25%. As far as actually opening new checking accounts online, that's up 170% year-over-year. It was
10% of our accounts a year ago, now it's 27% of our accounts. And consumer loans opening up online, is up 90%
year-over-year. A year ago, it was about 10% of our consumer loan. Now, it's 19%.

So I think as we think about the future, we'll continue to evaluate the rotation of brick and mortar expense into
digital expense. On the other corporate real estate front, when we did the merger and we analyzed our operations
center space, we've got two major operations centers. One in Charleston with a few hundred people and one in
Winter Haven, Florida, with a few hundred people. But in actuality, we have 17 total operation centers. So there's
15 smaller ones. Well, that's – those support teams have been working from home for six months and it's been
working fine. So I think it's very likely that as we go through this efficiency project with the merger that we may see
a significant reduction in a number of those smaller operation centers. These are secular trends you're hearing
from others and definitely there's a lever for us to continue to pull on a year-by-year basis.

Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
One more question, John. Do you think your revenue producers are as productive working from home as they are
working from the office?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John C. Corbett A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, CenterState Bank, NA (Winter Haven)
Yeah. Good question. I mean our – two quarters here, our loan production is down. So you got to say, well, is that
because the revenue producers aren't as productive or is that because the economy got shutdown. So I'd like to
believe that that there is productive – I mean, let me answer it a different way. Go back to the PPP process, okay?
The economy was shut down there. They were working from home. We did 20,000 loans in a period of about – I
want to say it was like three weeks. So I think that's the case study, PPP, that the ability to be productive is there,
at least in that kind of crisis moment, but I think our relationship managers love to get in front of their clients. So I
think that's slowly starting to open up. In the long term, you'd probably going to see a mix of in-person and also
more digital contacts. Good news is, on the RM front, we're having a lot of success now recruiting and there's a
lot of turmoil in the biggest banks. So it's a new world. We're all trying to figure out how much time to spend in
front of a Zoom call and how much time to spend in-person.

Stephen Dean Young A
Chief Strategy Officer, South State Corporation
Jennifer, I'd just add. Anecdotally, on some of these fee lines of business, whether it be mortgage fixed income
capital markets, they're all working remotely and having record production. So I think the ability to get in front of
clients is a little harder, but at the same time, I think we're all figure it out that you can do some of this more
remotely. So I think there's pluses and minuses out of both of them.
