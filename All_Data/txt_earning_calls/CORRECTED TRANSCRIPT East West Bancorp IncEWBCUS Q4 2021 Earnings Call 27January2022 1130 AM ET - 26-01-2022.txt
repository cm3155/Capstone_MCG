Thank you, Julianna. Good morning. Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our earnings call. I will begin the
review of our financial results with slide 3 of presentation. This morning, we reported net income of $218 million
and earnings per share of $1.52 for the fourth quarter of 2021. For the full year, East West achieved record
earnings of $6.10 per share. Record full year total revenue of $1.8 billion grew by 13% year-over-year, and record
net income of $873 million grew by 54%. This was driven by full year total loan growth of 12%, excluding PPP,
and full year total deposit growth of 19%. We returned 1.5% on assets and 17.2% on tangible equity for the year.
Our outstanding financial performance in 2021 reflected robust interest income and fee income growth, industry
leading efficiency and substantially improved asset quality. In the fourth quarter of 2021, nonperforming assets
decreased by 40%, and criticized loans were down by 18%. For each consecutive quarter of 2021, criticized loans
decreased. The fourth quarter annualized net charge-off ratio also decreased to a low 10 basis points. At the
same time, we maintained healthy allowances for loan losses. Our reserve coverage of loans was 1.3% as of
December 31, 2021.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2022
We're starting the new year from a position of strength. Loan growth prospects for 2022 are excellent. We believe
that our broad-based, diversified loan growth momentum from 2021 will continue in the new year, and we're
encouraged by the favorable credit environment. Our balance sheet is well positioned to benefit from current
market expectations for rising interest rates. Further, investments that we have made over the last several years
in cash management and payment related products and services have helped to strengthen our core deposit
base.
As of December 31, 2021, noninterest-bearing demand deposits made up 43% of total deposits, a record for East
West. We have a longstanding history of industry leading efficiency. Our adjusted efficiency ratio was a low 37%
in 2021. In 2022, we will continue to control expenses while investing in our strategic priorities to expand revenue,
enhance the customer experience and strengthen risk management and during growth and scalability. Put it all
together, these factors will drive robust earnings growth and strong profitability in the coming year and beyond.
Slide 4 presents a summary of our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2021, total loans reached a record high of
$41.7 billion. Excluding Paycheck Protection Program loans, total loans grew $1.5 billion or 15% annualized from
September 30, 2021 and by $4.3 billion or 12% year-over-year. Loan growth in 2021 was well-balanced across
C&I, residential mortgage and commercial real estate. On an average basis, fourth quarter total loans, excluding
PPP, grew by 10% annualized from the third quarter. Total deposit of $53.4 billion as of December 31, 2021 were
essentially unchanged from September 30, 2021, and up by $8.5 billion, or 19% from a year ago, driven by strong
growth in noninterest-bearing demand deposits. On an average basis, fourth quarter total deposit grew by 6%
annualized from the third quarter.
Turning to slide 5. You can see our strong capital ratios largely stable quarter-over-quarter. As of December 31,
2021, we had a common equity tier 1 ratio of 12.8% and a total capital ratio of 14.1%, which provides us with
meaningful capacity for future growth. Our book value per share increased 10.5% and a tangible equity per share
increased 12% year-over-year.
I'm pleased to announce that East West board of directors approved a 21% increase to the quarterly common
stock dividend from $0.33 per share to $0.40 per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $1.60 per share. The
new dividend will take effect beginning in the first quarter and is payable on February 22, 2022 to stockholders of
record on February 7, 2022.
Now moving on to a discussion of our loan portfolio, beginning with slide 6. C&I loans outstanding, excluding
PPP, were record $13.6 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of 18% annualized from September 30 and
up by 13% year-over-year. Total C&I commitments were $19.8 billion as of December 31, also up 18%
annualized sequentially and up 15% year-over-year. Quarter-over-quarter, our total C&I utilization was unchanged
at 69%.
By industry, we saw strong end of period net growth in the fourth quarter from private equity, entertainment and
general manufacturing and wholesale. Throughout the year, C&I growth for us has been diversified across our
lending teams, geographies and specialized verticals. From 2022, We expect that C&I growth will continue to be
well diversified. In our outlook, we are assuming that current line utilization levels are unchanged. An
improvement in utilization will provide upside to our current expectations. We're optimistic about a strengthening
economy and demand in our markets, but cautious about impact that the ongoing pandemic may have on near-
term growth.

Slide 7 and 8 shows the details of our commercial real estate portfolio, which is well-diversified by geography and
property type and consists of low loan to value loans. Total commercial real estate loans were $16.2 billion as of
December 31, 2021, up by 16% annualized from September 30 and up by 9% year-over-year. This quarter, we
saw the strongest net growth by property type in multifamily mortgages, and retail CRE.
In slide 9, we provide details regarding our residential mortgage portfolio, which consists of single-family
mortgages and home equity lines of credit. Residential mortgage loans were $11.2 billion as of December 31,
2021, growing by 9% annualized [indiscernible] (00:10:35) and up by 15% year-over-year. During the fourth
quarter, we originated $1 billion of residential mortgage loan, which was up 4% quarter-over-quarter and down 4%
year-over-year. Originations for the full year of 2021 were $4.3 billion, an increase of 29% year-over-year.
I will now turn the call over to Irene for a more detailed discussion about asset quality and income statement.

Thank you, Dominic. I'll start with our asset quality metrics on slide 10. I'm very pleased to report that during the
course of 2021, all asset quality metrics substantially improved. Total criticized loans decreased sequentially by
18% to $833 million as of December 31, 2021 and decreased by 32% year-over-year. The criticized loan ratio
improved by 117 basis points to 2% of total loans as of December 31, 2021, down from 3.2% of loans as of
December 31, 2020.
Quarter-over-quarter, nonperforming assets decreased by 40% to $103.5 million as of December 31. The change
in nonperforming assets in the fourth quarter reflects payoffs and upgrades of C&I loans and the sale of a
commercial real estate owned property. Year-over-year, nonperforming assets were down by 56%. The
nonperforming asset ratio improved to 17 basis points of total assets as of December 31, 2021, down from 45
basis points of total assets as of December 31, 2020.
Total oil and gas commitments were $912 million, and balances outstanding were $601 million as of December
31, 2021. We are comfortable with the portfolio size of under $1 billion in commitments for this sector. Year-over-
year, the risk profile of these borrowers has improved substantially.
On slide 11, we present the components of our allowance for loan losses. Our allowance totaled $542 million as
of December 31, 2021, 1.32% of loans excluding PPP compared with $560 million or 1.41% as of September 30.
The quarter-over-quarter change in the allowance reflects improvements in real estate metrics for our CRE loan
pools and a better operating backdrop for the oil and gas exposures. This was partially offset by higher downside
scenario weightings due to uncertainty related to the pandemic and the current Omicron variant. We believe that
the allowance coverage ratio will continue to moderately decline in the coming years.
Fourth quarter net charge-offs were $10 million, down from $13.5 million in the third quarter. The fourth quarter
net charge-off ratio was 10 basis points of average loans annualized, an improvement for 13 basis points
annualized for the third quarter. For the full year of 2021, the net charge-off ratio was 13 basis points compared to
17 basis points for the prior year. Assuming the economy continues to improve, we believe that the net charge-
offs for the full year 2022 will modestly improve from full year 2021 levels. During the fourth quarter, we recorded
a negative $10 million provision for credit losses same as in the third quarter and in line with our guidance. For the
full year of 2021, we recorded a negative $35 million provision for credit losses, largely due to an improved
macroeconomic forecast, partially offset by allowances required for the $4.3 billion growth in the loan portfolio.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2022
And now moving to discussion of our income statement on slide 12. This slide summarizes the key line items of
the income statement, which I'll discuss in more detail on the following slides. The noninterest income included in
interest rate contracts and other derivatives and mark-to-market adjustments, which were $0.4 million in the fourth
quarter, compared with $2.5 million in the third quarter. These primarily relate to changes in the CBA. On this
slide, the CBA marks are included in the other line of noninterest income.
Amortization of tax credits and other investments decreased this quarter to $32 million compared with $38 million
in the third quarter. Quarter-over-quarter variability and the amortization of tax credits partially reflects the impact
of investments that closed in the given period. The effective tax rate for the full year of 2021 was 17% which was
the same rate as in 2020. I'll now review the key drivers of our net interest income and net interest margin on
slides 13 through 16, starting with the average balance sheet.
Fourth quarter average loans of $40.5 billion grew by $572 million or 6% linked quarter annualized and excluding
PPP by $1 billion or 10% annualized. During the quarter, we deployed cash and cash equivalents into higher
yielding loans and securities. Average loans, securities and retail agreements increased by $1.7 billion, and
interest-bearing cash and deposits with banks yielding 25 basis points decreased by $986 million. Fourth quarter
average deposits of $54.3 billion were up by $820 million, or 6% linked quarter annualized led by growth in
noninterest-bearing demand deposits, which increased by $850 million or 15% annualized. Our average loan to
deposit ratio was 75% in the third quarter, unchanged from the third quarter.
We previously communicated that we're comfortable operating with a loan-to-deposit ratio up to the low 90s
percent range. Although core deposit growth is always a focus for East West, a loan-to-deposit ratio with the
starting point of 75% today provides us with flexibility to withstand deposit pricing pressure in a rising interest rate
environment, showing up the asset sensitive nature of our loan portfolio.
Turning to slide 14, fourth quarter 2021 net interest income of $406 million was the highest quarterly net interest
income in the history of East West, growing by 10% linked quarter annualized. Excluding PPP, net interest
income grew by 16% annualized in the fourth quarter. Income related to PPP loans was $10 million in the fourth
quarter, consisting of $8 million of deferred fees and $2 million of interest income. As of December 31, we had $6
million of PPP deferred loan fees remaining to accrete into income on a $534 million loan book.
The GAAP net interest margin expanded to 2.73% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 3 basis points from the
prior quarter. Excluding PPP, the fourth quarter adjusted NIM of 2.70% expanded by 6 basis points sequentially.
As you can see from the waterfall chart on the slide, the adjusted net interest margin expansion in the fourth
quarter reflects the favorable earning asset mix shift, combined with the lower cost of interest-bearing deposits.
Turning to slide 15. The fourth quarter average loan yield was 3.59%. And excluding the impact of PPP, the
adjusted loan yield was 3.56%, unchanged from the third quarter. Of our $27.4 billion in variable rate loans as of
December 31, $5.6 billion had fully indexed rates below floors, of which $1.9 billion were 25 basis points or less
from their floor rate. Another $1.9 billion were 25 to 75 basis points from their floor rate.
Turning to slide 16. Our average cost of deposits for the fourth quarter dropped to 10 basis points, an
improvement of 2 basis points from the third quarter. The spot rate on total deposits costs was 9 basis points as
of December 31, also down by 2 basis points from September 30. The cost of deposits declined as we continued
to reduce higher rate accounts and grow lower cost deposits.
The average cost of CDs in the fourth quarter was 33 basis points, a decrease of 2 basis points from the third
quarter. In the fourth quarter, we originated or renewed $4.9 billion of domestic CDs at a blended rate of 20 basis

points and a weighted average duration of four months. The repricing of maturing CDs to lower rates has reached
an equilibrium.
Moving on to fee income on slide 17, total noninterest income in the fourth quarter was $71.5 million compared
with $73 million in the third quarter. Customer driven fee income and net gains on sales of loans were $63 million,
essentially stable from the last three consecutive quarters and up 19% year-over-year. Quarter-over-quarter
growth on lending fees and deposit account fees were partially offset by lower interest rate contract and other
derivative income revenue and lower gains on sales of SBA 7(a) loans. Year-over-year, the growth in foreign
exchange income, deposit account fees, lending fees and wealth management fees largely reflects new customer
acquisitions and increased transaction volumes, particularly for cash management and foreign exchange beyond
the rebound from COVID-related troughs of 2020. Beyond quarter-to-quarter volatility, we're positive about the
trends in our fee income businesses and momentum for ongoing growth in 2022 and beyond.
Moving on to slide 18, fourth quarter noninterest expense was $210 million. Excluding amortization of tax credits
and other investments and core deposit intangible amortization, adjusted noninterest expense was $178 million in
the fourth quarter, an increase of $11 million or 7% sequentially. This expense growth was driven by higher bonus
and incentive compensation expense in the fourth quarter related to full year business activity and higher
charitable contributions. For the full year of 2021, the adjusted noninterest expense of $671 million was up 6%
year-over-year. The fourth quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was 37% compared with 36% in the third quarter and
40% in the year ago quarter. The full year 2021 adjusted efficiency ratio was also 37% and improved by over 200
basis points from 2020.
And with that, I'll now introduce our full year outlook for 2022 on slide 19. For the full year 2022, we currently
expect year-over-year loan growth, excluding PPP, for approximately 12% similar to growth in 2021 excluding
PPP. We expect well-diversified loan growth in 2022, driven by strong production from all of our major loan
portfolios and led by commercial and industrial loans. We are assuming that our current C&I utilization rate of
69% stays unchanged in our outlook.
Year-over-year adjusted net interest income growth, excluding PPP, in the range of 17% to 19%. This reflects
loan growth as well as the impact of anticipated fed funds increases on our asset sensitive balance sheet.
Underpinning our interest income assumptions is a forward interest rate curve as of January 26, 2022, which
assumes four fed funds rate hikes in 2022 in March, June, September and December. In our modeling, we are
factoring in a 30% beta on our deposits.
Adjusted noninterest expense growth, excluding tax credit investment amortization, of 7% to 8% year-over-year.
As we benefit from rising rates in our revenue growth, we expect to reinvest a portion of that revenue back into
our business, investing in people, technology to support our strategic initiatives. We expect our revenue and
expense outlook to result in positive operating leverage year-over-year.
In terms of credit items, for 2022, we currently expect that the provision for credit losses will be below $50 million.
We anticipate a modest improvement in the full year net charge-off ratio, which was 13 basis points in 2021. We
expect the full year 2022 effective tax rate will be approximately 17% to 18%, in line with the effective tax rate of
17% in 2021. This includes the impact of tax credit investments. There will be quarterly variability in the tax rate
due to timing of tax credit investments placed into service.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Dominic for closing remarks.

Thank you, Irene. In closing, 2021 was an outstanding year for East West. I wish to thank our team of over 3,000
associates for their unwavering dedication and hard work throughout the year and enabling us to serve our
customer with excellence while delivering strong financial performance. I also want to take this opportunity to wish

And maybe so just if you could start with deposit. So period end balances were relatively flat quarter-over-quarter.
If you could give us some perspective around what you're assuming in terms of deposit growth. I know Irene, you
referenced the low loan to deposit ratio. I'm just wondering, do you expect a meaningful rise in that ratio through
the course of this year and how we should be thinking about incremental deposit growth, especially in light of all
the investments you made on the treasury management side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Great question. [indiscernible] (00:26:08) customer kind of activity, we did see kind of flattish deposit growth, but
also as we noted in our call and in the financials, you can see that the average deposit growth was still quite
good. And I'll point out that year-to-date thus far, deposits have rebounded. As I mentioned, the customer activity
was a driver for the deposit balance right at 12/31. For 2022, realistically, what's going to be the driver for our
earnings, Ebrahim, is going to be the loan growth. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, obviously, deposit
growth is always a priority for East West, maybe just slightly less of a priority in 2022. With our modeling, we're
assuming about a 6% deposit growth in 2022.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2022
Well, let me just maybe add on also, core deposit growth, specifically noninterest-bearing operating accounts,
that's what we've been focusing on for the last several years. Many of our investments that we made throughout
the years, incrementally every single year, was to the payment and system and also digital banking for both of
commercial and consumer and really going at – looking at the commercial clients that we have and then figure out
how we can best serve our commercial clients, which have result in tremendous growth in our noninterest-bearing
demand deposit. As we indicated in the call, that is – it was 43% as of December 31, 2021. So we will continue to
drive those deposit growth. But the situation at East West is that, as you have seen, that we have much higher
deposit growth than loan growth for the last year or two, and we have a loan to deposit ratio at 78%. So obviously,
we don't have a need to chase deposits. We just want it to keep growing high quality core deposits, and that's part
that we'll continue to focusing on. But in terms of do we need deposit to support our asset and loan growth, the
answer is not. So obviously because of that reason, we are more comfortable to put more focusing on the lending
side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Understood. And just as a follow-up, you referenced strategic priorities, Dominic, in [indiscernible] (00:28:53)
earlier. Just wondering if you can elaborate on that, like where you're making investments and how we should
think about that manifesting on revenue growth, either on the fee income or the lending side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
We are making investments sort of like in the technology. We continue to focusing on also treasury management
area in terms of how do we further and better improve our payment-related products, cash management [ph]
products (00:29:27) and in addition to that, as I just mentioned earlier, digital banking, both consumer and
commercial, we also are putting more emphasis on wealth management. And this is an area we see that there is
going to be great opportunity for us in the next 5 to 10 years and we are putting more investment to that. Now, in
addition to it, we are adding on new bankers, both for consumer banking, wealth management and also
commercial banking. This various industry verticals that we started, some of them over 10 years ago, some of
them only the last two or three years, we can add on additional bankers to grow the business. In addition to that,
we are also growing geographically.
We did mention, I guess, right in the middle of the pandemic in 2020, we started our office in Chicago. Obviously,
for four months or so, we couldn't do anything because right in the middle of pandemic. But that little office in
Chicago have started making very decent commercial banking business growth in 2021. So we expect that to
grow even further. So we will continue to look at some of the other geographic field and that we think that will be
sort of like areas that make sense for East West to expand into. So one by one, I think adding people, adding to
appropriate type of product capability and further enhancing our technology and overall enterprise risk
management, all of those are the areas that we will incrementally improve in 2022 and beyond.

Good morning,
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Dominic, I want to ask about the outlook for C&I, I think in your prepared remarks, you said you're assuming
stable utilization in the guide. I guess two-part question. What do you think it will take to see that move up? And
then if it did move up a point, is there a rule of thumb for how much incremental growth that would lead to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Well, if this incrementally improved, I'm pretty sure that that would obviously increase the loan growth in terms of
outstanding balances.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, Chris, I can share. Like when we look at that, as we mentioned, the utilization hasn't increased substantially
quarter-over-quarter and in fact, very similar to year-over-year numbers as well. When we look at kind of the
utilization for the clients prior to the pandemic compared to the current levels with these customers, if we went
back to pre-pandemic levels, it's about $1.2 billion increase.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. That's great. And secondarily, the – I'm interested in your comments around the fee income opportunities. I
think you touched on wealth management, the higher – how should we think about just the evolving rate
environment and how that might affect your capital markets business which moves around quarter to quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I think on the capital markets, partially the volume is so low. In the fourth quarter, we did have higher kind
of a fee income related to our broker dealer. But – and that's in that other income line item. So I think that might
be what you're referring to, Chris. Overall for wealth management, look at that, I think that was also part of your
question. Year-over-year, we've grown that nicely and we expect in 2022, we'll continue to grow that as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, it's an area that I would say that is going to be multiyear's priorities, that – if I look back like maybe six,
seven years ago that I wanted to really put in effort in terms of improving treasury management like cash
management and also foreign exchange and then as of today, we see the numbers have grown substantially
higher than it was five years ago and so. And the wealth management area is another one of those high potential
area that we think that three or four years from now that we look back, the number is going to be substantially
higher than it is today.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
I guess circling back on the guidance with the tax rate, what's the assumption for tax credit amortization costs on
that offset?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Let me get that for you right away, I believe we're assuming about $130 million of tax credit amortization for the
full year of 2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then, looking at credit obviously, it's had great improvement as we've gone through the year
with the allowance ratio now looking like it's a little bit below the day one CECL. What's the impact of the
improved energy [ph] – the improvement in the (00:35:13) smaller energy book on that? And as we look out
through the year, what do you think a natural flow is given the economic environment for the allowance
[indiscernible] (00:35:25) total loans ratio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, that's a great question. So as of our year end, the allowance for the energy book was about $50 million and
that certainly is lower year-over-year and definitely lower than where we were day one CECL. Overall, when we
look at the trends for the allowance, we do expect it to come down from these levels to $130 million that we're at,
$132 million ex-PPP. Oil and glass (sic) [gas] (00:35:53), that portfolio [ph] certainly plays a (00:35:55) factor of
that, especially as the portfolio size decreases. And as you can see from the metrics that we've provided, the
credit quality and the performance has continued to improve. But I would also say that as the allowance, the
absolute dollars and the balance has come down. And I think that'll be less of a factor for the allowance in 2022
and the required ratios more so the rest of the portfolio, in particular, honestly, probably the CRE portfolio in 2022
and the metrics and the driver for that will have the largest impact for the allowance.

Hey. Good morning, guys.

David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
On the – good morning. On the NII guide, I just want to understand what you're expecting to be the impact of each
25 basis point rate hike that you've got in here. And then what's the level of medium-term interest rates that you're
assuming and the securities growth that you're factoring in as well? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Great questions. Right now with our modeling and the guidance, we expect the impact would be about $31
million per hike in 2022. We're not assuming real growth in the securities book. Now, some of that – really the
driver for that will be the liquidity and looking at what happens with the deposit growth. But we're not assuming
any major changes in that. And I think you mentioned the rate, the kind of the [indiscernible] (00:37:28) curve
actually has flattened a little bit, and that is also something that we've factored in with the guidance and the NII
increase related to rates.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2022
[indiscernible] (00:37:41) Yeah. Let me clarify one comment from Irene, the $31 million as she said per hike, that's
over a full year basis. So if the hikes are coming in at various points in time, you're not – you'd just have to factor
the time of – timing also.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Yeah. That makes sense. And then so for medium term interest rates, it doesn't sound like you're assuming that
those move out much from here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Got you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Most of the NII growth that we're factoring in really is from the growth of the loan book. And in fact, really even
without rate increases, we do expect that the increase in NII would be about 15%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Perfect. And then as my second question, just on fee income, just had solid growth in 2021. You've already talked
about the enhancements you made to treasury management. You've added [indiscernible] (00:38:34) as well.
What are your thoughts on growth for 2022 at this point? Do you think that the pace we saw in 2021 would be
appropriate to project in 2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Total fee income grew over 20% year-over-year. As we're kind of modeling for 2022, I don't know if we're
going to expect that level of growth, in particular, I would say that we had some items that may not recur in 2022
that happened in 2021. Some of the SBIC investments we had, a lot of kind of equity pick up from their positive
CVA adjustments. So we're not modeling that. But we do expect that core customer related fee income will grow
nicely year-over-year and we're assuming roughly about 15% on that.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Just want to follow up on the asset sensitivity, appreciate the $31 million per hike. But just – what are the deposit
beta assumptions that are being input for that kind of sensitivity?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. With the modeling, we're assuming 30% total deposit beta. For interest bearing, honestly compared to like
the last cycle, we're assuming no change. But of course, with the overall portfolio, the mix that we have, higher
level of DDA deposits, much higher level of operating accounts, we do expect a lower overall deposit beta of 30%
or so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. So that 30% is through the cycle, not necessarily for the first couple of hikes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
That's right. And the leading question there, but our assumption is the first couple of hikes, the beta is going to be
lower.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got you. Okay. And then just the liquidity deployment, obviously a nice move in the fourth quarter. On a period
end basis, you're down at $3.9 billion. Is there more room to go? Can you just give us a reminder as to where –
what sort of your minimum comfort level is there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I'd say there is a little bit more room to go. Our pace of that really is a function of evaluating what our
liquidity needs are, what's happening with the deposits. But overall, there is probably a little bit more room to go
on that.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 27-Jan-2022
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
So, yeah, I wanted to first touch on loan growth, specifically in CRE, and I wanted to know what was the
assumption for pay downs this upcoming year, they'll be lower or higher compared to 2021. I know some banks
have mentioned how higher interest rate environment could lead to lower payoffs. And I was wondering if that had
any impact on your guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, I think we are hoping so, too. In fact, with the – well, first of all, there were a lot of refi activities for the last
year or two. And I think that a lot of our clients are very sort of like gone through the refi exercise. And the other
thing [indiscernible] (00:42:02) picking up a little bit. I expect maybe a little bit less of those type of activities going
on. So hopefully that would help reduce the pay down. And in fact, it's part of our assumption for 2022, we do
expect a slightly less pay down than we experienced in 2021.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then on the expense guide, I was wondering what the composition of the growth in expenses is
expected to be, particularly for compensation. I know – so 9% growth in 2021. Is that expected in 2022 as well,
based off of the current outlook and potential bonus and incentive payouts?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, the increase in the expected noninterest expense is largely related to compensation and employee
benefits. Brandon, we're a growing organization. We're expecting to grow the loan book. Dominic mentioned kind
of new hires and new teams in Chicago riding throughout from the front office perspective and also the back
office. And most of the noninterest expense increases not that dissimilar to the activity that you saw in 2021
honestly or compensation will be the largest driver for that. But with that, we expect hopefully very soon
afterwards revenue growth as well.

Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. That's our expectation. Correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And I'm kind of surprised that four hikes don't add more.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
No. We – I think...
[indiscernible] (00:44:15)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Part of it is the shape of the curve. Part of it is the timing. I think it's also as we're evaluating it, we talked
about the deposit betas and then also the – one of the other factors is we're assuming kind of what the shape of
the curve also, maybe a little bit compression on the loan side. So we want to be realistic with our guidance with
that and the timing of that. And again, this is just 2022, right? We do expect further growth afterwards.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Julianna Balicka A
Director-Investor Relations & Corporate Finance, East West Bancorp, Inc.
And don't forget, the fourth hike in December has very little impact and the third hike is also late in the year. So it
sounds – four hike sounds impressive until you work it out over the course of the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
We'd be happy to work through the model with you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And there's a follow-up, just in terms of general commercial [ph] calling efforts (00:45:13), the client growth
that you're seeing, is it what we would associate with a Chinese ethnic bank or are you of the size now where
many of these new relationships have no ties to that whatsoever?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
We are getting both. I mean, that's what – that's one of the reasons why you've been seeing this consistent,
sustainable, profitable growth at East West Bank and we have the advantage of – when we compete like a
regional bank with banks within the US footprint, we obviously have many different industry verticals and in some
good geographical area, and that would cover those C&I business quite well and cover those [ph] CRE (00:46:07)
business quite well.
And then we also have the cross-border banking activities that continue to have sustainable growth. If we looked
at the last four years with this tariff and US-China sort of trade situation that is happening, that didn't stop East

West from growing. And we continue to see growth coming from cross-border banking business. And in our
consumer banking side, we are the dominant financial institution in the retail space when it covers the Chinese
American customers from single family mortgages, home equity lines and also consumer deposit, et cetera and
then of course, foreign exchange business. So we are going well with continuing to expand in both areas. And so
far, we have full confidence that 2022 and beyond, we'll see similar trend.

Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Tenner with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks. Good morning. Just as you're thinking about loan growth in 2022, and obviously, you gave the guide on
that. In 2021, the growth ended up being very well distributed among the three main loan segments. So just
asking if your expectations include any sort of shift in where more loan growth comes from in 2022 versus 2021.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. In fact, what you notice is that we have in the past – residential mortgage tend to be the lead, and then
CRE, C&I. And we started from the third quarter in 2021 and onward, C&I are taking the lead. And naturally,
because I would expect in 2022 from what we see in the rate environment and the activities from the – in the past
few years, refi market for single-family mortgages probably slowed down a little bit. So we wouldn't expect single-
family mortgages to have those like in fact, a few years ago, 20-plus percent kind of growth. So most likely, we're
expecting C&I to be the lead to grow faster than CRE and single-family. In fact, as our outlook, we are predicting
a little bit higher growth in C&I and then steady 10% growth, both from CRE and single-family mortgages.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Can you tell us what your mix of refi and purchase was in single-family for 2021?

Dominic Ng A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
I don't know if I have that mix for the full year, but our originations definitely pivot towards a purchase versus refi.

Matthew T. Clark Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Just a follow-up on the loan growth question as it relates to SFR. I recall pricing competition got a little – more
challenged there and you guys backed away from the market. The curve is steep and at least the long ends
obviously come up. Are you guys more actively involved in that space and how much of your outlook is based on
slower prepay activity?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Irene H. Oh A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, East West Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, I want to clarify. We did kind of during the course of 2021 at various points, we discontinued a 30-year
mortgage. And it wasn't really pricing competition. It was really kind of the pricing caps and we thought that pricing
levels were too low for that. For our guidance and when we look at 2022, we're not really assuming that the payoff
and refi activity really play a huge factor and the [indiscernible] (00:50:43) really is going to decrease a lot from
the levels that we've had and been experiencing. So certainly that can help us well that if that diminishes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew T. Clark Q

It's still very robust market. Our product offerings, originations, as you know, really are through the branch network
and still pipeline is very strong on the single-family.
And also the HELOC product, which for us, a lot of our customers, it's very similar depending on their needs, right.
Most of our HELOCs are first-lien HELOCs.
