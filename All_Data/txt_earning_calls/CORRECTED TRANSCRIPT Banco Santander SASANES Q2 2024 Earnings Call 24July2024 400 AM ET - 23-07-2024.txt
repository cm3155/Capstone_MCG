Q2 2024 Earnings Call 24-Jul-2024
The main highlights of our results in the first half of 2024 are the following. Q2 was another record quarter for
Santander, which shows the strength of our strategy and the resilience of our business model. Profit reached €3.2
billion. That's 20% above Q2 2023, even after the impact of €450 million of onetime charges, net of taxes and
minorities. Excluding them, recurring profit was €3.7 billion in Q2. Profit in the first half reached €6.1 billion, also a
record high, up 16%, supported by the strong cost of revenue growth in all regions and global businesses.
We continued to accelerate ONE Transformation to become simpler, more automated and more integrated. As a
result, our efficiency ratio improved by 261 basis points to 41.6%, the best in 15 years, and our return on tangible
equity rose 137 basis points to 15.9% or 16.3% if we analyze the impact of the temporary levy in Spain. Finally,
our solid balance sheet with a sound capital ratio, solid credit quality and a strict capital discipline help us reach
strong profitable growth and shareholder value creation with TNAV plus dividend per share increasing 12%.
Let's stop for a moment in our income statement. As always, we present growth rates in both current and constant
euros. This quarter, there were no material differences between them. Since last quarter, we have reported
variation in constant euros in all countries except Argentina, which is shown in current euros to mitigate the
distortions from hyperinflation. In Q2, we have taken a prudent approach again and used an inflation adjusted
exchange rate for the Argentine peso given the significant divergence between inflation and the official effects.
Although it has little impact when comparing half years, distortions are more significant when we compare with
Q1.
Our P&L is strong from top to bottom. Revenue was all-time high with record NII and fees supported by all global
businesses and regions. Second, expenses increased below inflation and below revenue on good cost
management and costs has been stable for four quarters in a row. Third, we have reported net operating income
growing double-digit for nine consecutive quarters, demonstrating the sustainability of our results. Fourth, loan
loss provisions continued to normalize as expected.
The highest profit ever, as I mentioned before, was achieved even after onetime charges. These were 210
additional Swiss mortgage provision in Poland, reaching coverage of 100%, €240 million from the write down of
our merchant platform in Germany and Superdigital in Latin America that I will explain in more detail later on.
Additionally, we have positive and negative oneoff impacts in Brazil which do not affect profit and have been
netted in the underlying P&L.
This, as you can see, is a strong first half of the year with solid commercial and business dynamics that already
puts us ahead of our plan for 2024. As a result, we have upgraded some of our targets for the year. We have
increased our revenue growth target to high-single digit with better NII and fee income. We have improved our
efficiency ratio target to around 42% as accelerating ONE Transformation leads to higher operational leverage,
and we have raised our RoTE target to above 16% versus the previous 16%.
We are also confirming the rest of our targets for the year. Cost of risk is expected to remain stable at around
1.2% on active risk management and strong labor markets. As a reference, year-to-date cost of risk was 1.17%,
even with additional provisions that I just described in Poland. In capital, our CET1 ratio ended June at 12.5%,
with a strong organic capital generation in line with our target to be above 12% even after the Basel III
implementation.
ONE Transformation and the operational leverage it brings are behind our record performance is structurally
improving both revenue and cost performances. Simplifying and automating processes, plus our active spread
management, have already contributed 266 basis points of efficiencies since we started. Our global businesses

continued to push the group's profitability and have delivered 87 basis point in efficiency gains. Finally, our
proprietary and global tech capabilities have generated 71 basis points in efficiencies so far.
As we have often said, we are going back to basics, which supports value creation based on profitable growth.
How? By focusing on offering customers the best products and user experience and by obtaining the operational
leverage from global platforms and common tech. This is reflected in the performance of our global businesses.
Our Retail and Consumer businesses' efficiency ratio improved by 480 basis points and 270 basis points,
respectively.
In CIB, we are building a world-class business, leveraging our expertise to grow in the US, maintaining our risk
profile. Revenue grew 6%, another record, supported by the strong performance and client flows in the US.
Wealth continued its strong growth, improving efficiency and profitability. And in Payments, where we manage
over 100 million cards in the group, we have significantly improved profitability.
As a reminder, in Q1 of last year, we had a onetime fee from a commercial agreement in Brazil. Excluding this
impact, Payments revenue would be 6% up and efficiency would have improved by 113 basis points even after
investing in the global platforms.
In the coming five slides, I will review the advances on each of our global businesses. Let's start with Retail where
we are working to become the number one bank for our customers. It is a great example of the benefits from ONE
Transformation. Innovation helps to offer the best customer experience. In Mexico, for example, our new digital
processes helped onboarding time and led to a record 90,000 digital account openings just last month.
Our common operating model across our banks, automation and digitalization frees up time of our people to focus
on commercial activities. Dedication of resources to non-commercial activities has dropped 8% versus last year.
Deployment of our global platform has continued. In the US, it has been successfully completed. Within the group,
Gravity is already operational in Spain, the UK, Mexico, Brazil and Chile, and it is processing a number of
transactions that is around 20% higher year-on-year.
Financially, we're extracting the potential from today's favorable conditions in our footprint as we benefit from our
diversification. We carefully manage margins in the higher for longer rate environment in Europe and keep
capturing the benefits from our negative sensitivity to rates in South America and while we achieve a strong
capital – a strong operational leverage across the group.
As a result, our profit grew 35% year-on-year, RoTE up 430 basis points to 18.1% on the back of revenue up
double-digit, on good performance of NII and fees, with all regions growing especially Europe and South America.
Cost is well under control, down 4% in real terms, reflecting the structural benefits from our transformation, and
provision and cost of risk fairly stable at comfortable levels.
In Consumer, we strive to be the partner of choice for our customers. Our best-in-class global solutions are
integrated into our partners' processes. For example, last year, we launched a new digital onboarding to pure
direct auto players, which allows them to offer their customers the completion of their auto finance online, end-to-
end, in very little time. We are progressing well in deposit gathering to increase NII stability and autonomous
funding across the interest rate cycle. Deposits were up 14% year on year supported by our digital solutions. We
expect positive trends to continue helped by the launch of our deposit gathering platforms.

Deploying global platforms is key to scaling our business, reducing cost to serve and improving profitability. In
checkout lending, we recently launched installments loans with Apple in Germany through Zinia, which we are
looking to expand to other European countries.
Consumer had a great quarter on its operational leverage, which resulted in double-digit growth in net operating
income and a 4% profit increase in H1 with, number one, strong revenue, driven by positive commercial dynamics
with higher volumes, mainly in Europe and Brazil, good NII performance and 27% fee growth from insurance.
Number two, cost falling 3% in real terms on the execution of our strategy and efficiency plans executed last year.
And third, higher provisions, mainly Swiss franc mortgages and expected cost of risk normalization in Europe and
the US.
Volumes and good profitability levels of the new business makes us confident that Consumer will end 2024 with a
profit growth of around double-digit even after the normalization of provisions.
We are building a world class CIB business for our clients that leverages our strengths and global footprint to
grow profit while maintaining the same low risk profile. We are deepening our client relationships and increasing
our capabilities in the US, building on our areas of expertise to accelerate growth across regions. Our
collaboration in the US with the rest of the group is starting to pay off with several firsts. For example, we made
our first corporate share buyback for a US company, and we were appointed global coordinator for a US-listed
IPO for the first time ever.
In Mexico, we are creating a significant partnership within the Mexico-US corridor, leveraging our global markets
and US Bank Build-Out (sic) [US Banking Build-Out] (00:13:31) initiatives. And these are just a few examples
from a long list. As a result, revenue in CIB in the US rose 33% year on year. This strong growth reflects the
benefits of our US Banking Build-Out initiative, which will become even more evident in the coming quarters.
We continue to spend and strengthen our centers of expertise, including key industry groups such as chemicals,
technology and paper and packaging. Our CIB business is capital-light, very much linked to customers and with
fees growing at a good pace year on year. Our active capital management continue to support [indiscernible]
(00:14:12) origination and high profitability levels. In essence, CIB had great results, increasing revenue in H1 6%
year on year even after a record first half in 2023, making H1 the best ever, with fees growing at double digits and
the vast majority of our growth coming from customer flows.
Moving on to Wealth Management & Insurance, we continue to build the best bank, private bank in each and
insurance manager in Europe and the Americas. How? Number one, by improving customer relationships through
the best service and right solutions, resulting in double-digit growth in private banking customers. Second,
collaboration with other businesses, especially retail and CIB, which is a major driver for growth and allows us to
capture network benefits. Collaboration fees increased by 12% year on year. Third, developing global platforms
across all three businesses and digitalize our distribution and advisory capabilities to improve customer
experience and promote growth. A good example of this is Auto Compara, our auto insurance comparison engine
that operates in six countries and which we are expanding to new segments and businesses.
In summary, we're accelerating growth and maintaining high profitability. Attributable profit rose double-digit on a
strong private banking activity in a favorable interest rate environment with total fees from all three businesses
growing at double digit and cost up slightly in real terms. Finally, efficiency improved 230 basis points year on
year and RoTE rose to – 250 basis points to over 80%.

Finally, Payments, where we have our unique positions on both sides of the value chain, one, issuing where we
manage more than 100 million cards worldwide, and second, in merchant acquiring. In merchant, we are the
second largest acquirer in Latin America and a market leader in Spain and Portugal with the right balance
between growth and profitability. We are gaining market share in most markets as we strengthened Getnet's
customer value proposition with new global solution. An example is dynamic currency conversion in Mexico,
which has helped Getnet to become second in Mexico with a 20% market share and a 47% EBITDA margin in
Q2.
We continue to migrate significant volumes of Payments to PagoNxt global platform to leverage the group scale.
The transactions managed globally through PagoNxt Payments surpassed 1 billion per year during the first half of
this year, with [ph] 30% (00:17:06) growth quarter on quarter. The rollout of Plard, our global cards platform, is on
track. We continue to increase the number of debit cards managing Plard at a good pace and we're starting the
migration of the debit portfolio. We plan to manage around 15 million cards through Plard in Brazil by year-end.
As I mentioned earlier, we recorded one-off charges in PagoNxt from the write-down of investments. One is the
discontinuation of our merchant platform in Germany we announced in June as we are focusing on our current
acquiring value proposition in our core markets, where we have a very competitive business. The other one is our
decision to write down Superdigital, a natural step to promote the use of common platforms across the group and
maximize operational leverage. These decisions will enable a more stable and profitable business, reducing fixed
cost going forward.
Excluding these impacts, underlying performance was very positive. Profit in Payments was up 30% year on year
on good revenue performance, costs falling in real terms while we invest in our common platforms and sound
credit quality in cards. PagoNxt's EBITDA margin improved to 20%, one of the best among competitors. We
expect the consistent execution of our strategy, efficiency and CapEx optimization will continue to drive
profitability in the coming quarters.
Today, results show that our strategy has enabled us to deliver outstanding profitability growth in H1 with double-
digit shareholder value creation for the fifth consecutive quarter. RoTE was 16.3%, up 134 basis points year on
year, reflecting the high levels of profitability at which we are [ph] originally (00:19:02) originating new business.
EPS rose to nearly €0.37, that's around 20% year on year and we delivered 12% growth in shareholder value
creation, supported all by strong profit generation, our strict discipline in capital allocation and share buybacks.
We have repurchased around 11% of our outstanding shares in the last three years, returning around €6.5 billion
through buybacks and providing a return on investment of 19% to our shareholders.
I leave you now with José to go into our financial performance in more detail. Please, José.

Thank you, Héctor. And good morning, everyone. Like always, I will go into a bit more detail in the P&L and the
capital ratio but let me start by making some general comments. The first one is that our record profits include, as
Héctor mentioned, €450 million from one-offs coming basically from the write-downs in PagoNxt and additional
provisions in the Swiss franc mortgage portfolio in Poland. We also had a one-off in Brazil related to capital gain
from the transaction we announced with Sodexo, but we use that amount to strengthen the balance sheet so no
impact on the bottom line. We achieved these results as our transformation continues to drive operational
leverage, with very positive momentum both in Europe and in Latin America at the same time. Revenue grew 9%
with the highest NII and fee income in our history and costs were down slightly in real terms. As a result,
operating income was up 14%.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 24-Jul-2024
Provisions increased even after including the €200 million increase in Swiss franc provisions that we took in the
quarter. On the right-hand side, you can see the upward trend in profit quarter on quarter at 12%, which was
driven by top line growth with lower cost and provisions fairly flat, as I just mentioned.
Let me now spend a couple of minutes on the reasons why we're starting to use a new inflation-adjusted
exchange rate in Argentina rather than the official one. We have observed a significant divergence between the
official exchange rate and inflation, and we have decided to follow a prudent accounting approach. The new
exchange rate is the result of adjusting the official exchange rate with a differential between the inflation in
Argentina and in the US. This is a very conservative approach and a much more conservative way of recognizing
the actual value in euros of our results and our investment in Argentina, and this should mitigate the volatility that
the currency might experience in the future, as you all remember, was the case in 2023.
Following these accounting rules, we have recorded the full Q1 and Q2 impacts from this adjustment in Q2, which
does not significantly affect the year-on-year figures, but it has significant impact and causes some distortions
when we look at quarter on quarter. And I will try to show these differences in the coming slides. For instance, NII
is dropping, is down 4% in the quarter, but if we exclude Argentina, the group's NII would have gone up 2%.
Something similar happens with fees, instead of decreasing in the quarter or increasing 1%, they would have
increased 3%, and cost would have been fairly flat. If this exchange rate does not materialize, we would revert
this adjustment and account for the results that we are not recognizing today, but it looks to us that this is a
prudent, more conservative way of recognizing our investment and results in Argentina.
There was a strong total revenue growth driven by customer revenue again this quarter, which made up more
than 95% of total revenue. This strong growth was primarily supported by Retail. Retail accounts, as you know,
for more than 50% of our businesses, and is growing at double-digits with very good performance in NII across
regions, and fees also growing, especially in the Americas, and also Consumer, which is reaching good
profitability levels in new businesses and a strong loan growth in Europe and LatAm. Corporate Investment
Banking also had a good quarter as revenue reached an all-time high both in the quarter and in the first half of the
year, particularly in Spain, in the US and in Mexico.
Also double-digit growth in Wealth, as Héctor mentioned, driven by solid commercial activity in private banking
and in asset management. Payments also performing very well, particularly if we exclude the one-time positive
impact recorded in Brazil in the first quarter of 2023, as you remember, which we explained and Héctor just
mentioned, where we had a one-off from an agreement with MasterCard. And finally, the Corporate Centre's
higher liquidity buffer remuneration was offset by higher TLAC/MREL issuances and the negative impact from FX
hedging. Most of our revenue growth came from NII which continued to increase in the quarter, if we exclude
Argentina, particularly driven by Retail, Consumer and CIB, which represented 95% of group's NII.
On the slide, you can see that we are, in this small box in red, put in the figure that we would have recorded if we
had used the official Argentina exchange rate. So this is important to keep this in mind and to show again that
what we have decided to do is a prudent accounting of our profits coming from Argentina. NII rose 11% year-on-
year, supported by all businesses and regions on the back of very active price management in Retail Europe,
especially in deposits, also higher volumes and the benefits of negative sensitivity to interest rates in South
America, in Retail South America and in Consumer, which is now very evident, especially in Brazil and Chile, and
very good levels of activity in Corporate Investment Banking.
In terms of profitability, we have improved net interest margin year-on-year explained by higher yield on assets as
we continue repricing our books, but also very good management of deposit costs, which more than basically

outweighed the pressures that we are seeing. It's true that the margin is expanding, as you can see, if we exclude
Argentina or if we had used the official exchange rate. So overall, the margin management, pricing management
on both the asset side and liability side is really strong. We see a slight deterioration though if we use our official
exchange rate, our adjusted exchange rate, although it's not very significant in the quarter. Going forward, we
would expect some marginal margin pressure in Europe that will be more than compensated by positive
contribution from the Americas and our Consumer business.
In the context of low fee growth in general across the sector as a result of subdued loan demand, we generated
another record quarter in fee income, €6.5 billion, with solid growth all across the five businesses. Retail
increased 3%, basically driven by Brazil, North America and Poland. Outstanding performance in Consumer on
the back of very strong insurance businesses. Corporate Investment Banking also grew from already very high
levels in the first half of last year, especially in the US; Wealth, supported by very strong private banking activity.
And Payments, as we mentioned, was affected by the one-time fee recorded in Brazil last year. Structural
efficiency gains from our transformation program are very evident quarter after quarter.
Cost to income was 41.6%, the best level that we have reported for the last 15 years, and one of the best in the
sector. It's already better than the levels that we guided for 2024. Cost declined quarter-on-quarter. We're very
flattish if we exclude Argentina after having been stable for the last three quarters with revenue growing steadily
quarter-after-quarter, improving an increase in operational leverage that we obviously expect to continue to have
in the second half of the year and into 2025. Average inflation continued its gradual decline, down from 12% a
year ago to below 4% this quarter. In this context, cost fell 1% in real terms year-on-year. Despite that, as you all
know, we have some lagged effects from higher inflation on salaries and other costs and our investments in
transformation.
By businesses, cost remained well under control in Retail, Consumer and Payments, which represent 80% of our
cost base. And 80% of the increase, as you can see on the bottom of the chart, came from CIB, reflecting our
strategy to reinforce our Corporate Investment Banking franchise. In fact, if we exclude this investment, cost in the
rest of the group would have decreased 3% in real terms. Credit quality remained very much under control,
obviously it's supported by stable economic environment and our active risk management all across the group.
Cost of risk was 1.21%. Remember that we look at the last 12 months. If we look at the first half of the year, cost
of risk was 1.17%, even including the increase in the provisions for the Swiss franc mortgage portfolio in
Argentina. So we are very much on target to reach the 1.2% for the year and we reiterate that target.
In the second half, we expect that trends in Consumer and Mexico will be closer to more normalized levels, but
this will be offset by a better performance in Retail Europe and South America. Turning to capital and closing my
section here, our CET1 ratio remains at very comfortable level backed by strong organic capital generation and
significant risk-weighted asset rotation. This quarter we generated 52 basis points organically supported by our
asset rotation initiatives to compensate organic risk-weighted asset growth. We recorded 25 basis points charge
for shareholder remuneration, in line with our 50% payout. And finally, there was a 7-basis point negative impact
mainly related to intangibles, the valuation of available-for-sale portfolios and others. There were no significant
regulatory impacts in the quarter.
We continue to deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities and expand our asset mobilization
capabilities to maximize capital productivity. Our disciplined capital allocation has resulted in a new book return on
risk-weighted assets of 2.9% in the quarter, which is equivalent to a return on tangible equity of 23%, well above
that of our back book at 16%. Our centralized asset management desk, which aims at optimizing capital
deployment, is achieving outstanding results. In the first half, we disposed off an amount of capital equivalent of
€30 billion in risk-weighted assets at a cost of capital of half of that of the new originations. In addition, the one-

third of our balance sheet that matures every year is being substituted by the more profitable new businesses at
this return on tangible equity of 23%. The combination of these actions explain the expanding profitability and the
increasing capital ratio.
Let me turn it now back to Héctor for his conclusions.

Héctor Blas Grisi Checa
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, José. As our results clearly show, we continue to make good progress towards the targets we set for
2025 in our last Investor Day. Thanks to our unique business model and execution of our strategy, with a strong
and increasing organic capital generation and execution of our capital allocation plans, further improving our
profitability to above 16%. And by growing both profit and profitability sustainably, we have been able to deliver
12% value creation to our shareholders. We said it in our Investor Day and I want to remind you again, we have
entered a new phase for value creation for our shareholders.
In conclusion, the benefits from the execution of our strategy are very evident. The strong growth in revenue with
flattish cost and around 20% growth in EPS, and the best ever H1 profit with all-time high NII, fees and net
operating income backed by strong performance in all our businesses and regions. Sustained progress in our
structural change to a simpler and more integrated model, leveraging the group's scale, is driving both high
revenue and lower cost to achieve the best efficiency ratio we have ever reported in the last 15 years. Our rock-
solid balance sheet and robust credit quality are contributing to growth and double-digit shareholder value
creation.
As a result, we expect to exceed some of our targets for 2024. We are upgrading our revenue growth target to
high single-digits, efficiency to run 42%. And as we deploy capital to the most profitable growth opportunities, we
are improving our profitability target to above 16%. Our focus at Santander is to be reliable in providing returns
that compound on an always increasing quantum of tangible book value, consistently and through the cycle based
on both business and geographic diversification. The progress of the last 10 years to simplify and align our model
in all our businesses and now deploy our own tech stack is already evident, and now depends on execution to
continue to deliver on our primary target of double-digit TNAV plus DPS growth through the cycle.
And now, we will be happy to take all your questions. Thank you.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We already have our first question from Sofie Peterzens from
JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sofie Peterzens Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Yeah. Hi. This is Sofie from JPMorgan. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. So my first question would be on the
risk transfers. Did I hear you correctly that you saw €30 billion of risk-weighted asset disposals in the quarter?
And maybe you could just talk about the decline in risk-weighted assets. I see risk-weighted assets, especially in
Spain, were down around 2% quarter-on-quarter, in Digital Consumer Bank minus 1% quarter-on-quarter. But in
both entities, the loan book grew by 3% quarter-on-quarter. So how should we think about these SRTs or
securitizations, and what will be the revenue impacts going forward from securitizing some of the loans? And also
related to that, if you could just remind us on the regulatory capital headwinds that are coming in the second half.
And then my second question would be on Ebury. There has been quite a few press articles suggesting that you
are looking to potentially IPO Ebury. Can you just remind us what the tangible book value per share is, or tangible
book value for these businesses, how much revenue you get from Ebury and what your kind of plans for Ebury is?
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Sofie. I mean, first of all, I mean, our policy basically has been to, as José was explaining in detail, to
rotate the balance sheet as much as we can. This is basically a very important change for us given the high
capabilities that we have to reunite assets. So this is basically helping us to rotate. And also giving us a new,
basically I would say, a turbocharger in the sense that, with every single time that we sell something, we basically
reuse that capital or redeploy that capital within the organization at a much better price. So that's exactly what
we're doing and rotating the capital in a much better way.
As José was explaining you, we'll rotate a third of the balance sheet every year. And since we're very focused on
profitability, we're actually reinvesting better and better. And that's actually a new way of basically managing the
balance sheet of the bank. Then, José can give you a little bit of the details in terms of what you were explaining
about it. In terms of regulatory capital, as we told you, our guidance is basically to be above 12% after regulatory
charges, et cetera. So we continue to basically hang on to that number, 12%, above 12%. And as I said, and José
basically reiterated, we're going to be above the 12% after Basel III as well. And in terms of the IPO of Ebury, we'll
give you the details, José will give you the details on that. Thank you, José.

Hi, Sofie. First of all, the €30 billion was risk-weighted assets in the first half. So more or less, 40% of these is
SRTs, but the rest is other types of transactions, like asset sales, hedges, et cetera. The cost of mobilizing this
€30 billion was around in RoTE equivalent. We always look at RoRWA. But just to use the same currency
everywhere, in RoTE equivalent, the cost of mobilizing these €30 billion was slightly below 10%. And we
reinvested the capital, as I said, at 23%. So there was at least 13 percentage points difference on these €30
billion in risk-weighted assets. €30 billion in risk-weighted assets is close to €4 billion in capital, times this 13%.
So on an annualized basis, we generated increased profits with the same capital of around €500 million. We

expect to continue doing this. The demand for private credit is significant. We have a very busy second half of the
year. It's difficult to replicate the same figure in the second half of the year because of holidays, et cetera, but we
expect to mobilize much more than last year.
And as you can see from the figures I gave you, this is very profitable. Capital headwinds this year, we still expect
20 basis points to 30 basis points in the second half of the year. Basel III, as Héctor mentioned, fully loaded. And
when we mention fully loaded, it's fully loaded even taking into account those impacts that come in 2029, we will
be comfortably above 12%, and the day one impacts will be very relatively small, as we mentioned before. And in
the case of Ebury, we are always looking at ways of managing the capital and maximizing capital usage. So there
were some news that we are contemplating an IPO in Ebury. Again, we are looking at all types of alternatives to
maximize the capital. This is one of them. That doesn't necessarily mean that this will be executed. And again,
this will be put as one of our several capital management initiatives that we have across the group.

Ignacio Ulargui Q
Analyst, BNP Paribas SA
Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two questions. The first one is on the revenue
performance. We have seen a very good performance in Europe, probably a bit better than what we expected, at
least expected at the beginning of the year. LatAm has been lagging a bit behind with Brazil being softer. How
should we think about the revenue performance going forward in the second half when you have upgraded the
revenue guidance to high single-digits from the 9% currently? Should we expect second half in line with these
levels? Kind of getting a little bit of a sense whether LatAm should offset the weakness of Europe that you have
flagged, José, during the call in margin. And the second question is on the UK. If you could elaborate a bit what
should we expect in terms of NII for the UK. It looks NIMS are stabilizing. So trying a bit of getting your thoughts
on the outlook for the UK. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Ignacio. I mean, first of all, let me tell you, as you have said, revenue has been very strong, much
stronger than we believed at the beginning. Rates have helped, but also the good performance of our different
businesses. As you know, we are very focused on profitability in the way we're structuring things, and the NAV
basically is paying off. I believe that, I mean, revenue will continue basically to give good results. I don't see that
LatAm has a weakness. I see that actually LatAm is going to be doing very well in the second half. And you can
see also very good results coming out of what we are doing in Retail in Brazil and also Chile is doing quite a good
performance. Mexico, basically on Retail, we're changing the mix, and that's why you see the flat NII in there. But,
I mean, it will continue to give very good results. So we expect a very good second half of the year in terms of
revenue. And in that sense, basically what you were asking about the UK, UK was a better second half.
First of all, we see that the market is a little bit more rational. Competition has been much rational than we saw
during the first quarter. Second quarter has stabilized. We also, some of the strategies we have done in terms of
betas are paying off. So I believe that, all in all, UK will have a much better second half of the year than we have
seen. In terms of Retail, basically it's more rational behavior, as I told you. Fees are not going to be doing that well

due to the future campaign that we structured, but benefits will come over in the third and fourth quarter, much
better than the way we basically saw it. And what you're going to see is also a very good cost control because we
have cost control initiatives coming into the UK which are going to make the business perform much better than
we saw. I don't know if José would like to complement a little bit on the revenue side, but...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
I think, I'm sure that you will ask about NII. You mentioned that revenue in Europe is better than you expected. At
the beginning of the year, we guided for a drop in NII in the Eurozone. We now see NII in the Eurozone,
particularly in Spain, Portugal, et cetera, up mid-single-digits. Obviously, rates are higher for longer. So much
better performance in NII. We have hedged a substantial amount of our balance sheets in the Eurozone basically
through the ALCO portfolio, hedging the assets, particularly mortgages, and also swapping our fixed liabilities into
variable liabilities. And it means that the sensitivity of our NII in Europe going forward is going to be significantly
lower than we had before. So as Héctor mentioned, we expect fairly stable, maybe a slightly down NII in Spain in
the second half of the year and next year. But at the same time, we continue to see good momentum coming from
South America, Brazil, and particularly Chile. So we are constructive on the future evolution of NII and revenue in
the second half.

Alvaro Serrano Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
Hi. Good morning. Can I ask couple of follow ups? On just wanted to confirm the comment you just made around
mid-single-digit in Spain NII. That implies, I think, almost 9% reduction half-on-half, which it feels a bit substantial.
So I don't know if I have done my math very quickly wrong, or if you can sort of add a bit of color on that. And then
on the performance in fees in the US, could you give us a bit of color on the – obviously, very strong performance,
but if you can maybe sort of give us some kind of color on split on, is it ECM, DCM, just to form an opinion of how
sustainable it is going forward? If I can slip in a third, you've mentioned over 12% capital, but I thought the target
was 12.5% at the end of the year. So can you just confirm that's the case, and we should still expect the 20 basis
points, 30 basis points regulatory headwinds? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Alvaro. First of all, let me talk about capital. In capital, we have always said, we're going to be above
12%, and that basically has been the guidance. We're at 12.5% right now. And we said, as José basically
reiterated, that we're going to be above 12% even after Basel III fully loaded. That's exactly the guidance. In terms
of performance in the US fees, the majority is basically the CIB. Our business in CIB is the one that is driving, and
also a little bit in terms of good performance in Retail that we're having a little bit also in the US. But CIB is the
main driver. It grew 38% year-on-year, 1.3% quarter-on-quarter. As you know, CIB business is cyclical. So we
have pretty good mandates. The business is basically doing well. And also a very good connection in between
what we're doing with the US, as I explained during the presentation, with the business in Latin America and the
business in Europe.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 24-Jul-2024
What's happening, and let me explain a little bit is, some of the businesses that we used to do in terms of DCM
that we wouldn't get because we wouldn't be seen as a dollar house, we're becoming one and you'll see us top
three in the league tables right now in Latin America doing dollar transactions, not just to the corporates but also
to the governments. I mean, when [indiscernible] (00:47:48) transaction at the beginning of the year, €7.5 billion,
we were one of the principal bookrunners in the transaction. So you're starting to see that because of the
[indiscernible] (00:47:57) that we did in the US. So that's starting to payoff. I believe that with the four teams that
we added, I think, it's going to complement the rest of the business and will continue driving fees up. But let's see
what happens with the cyclicality of the business.
On the other side, Retail is also performing well in fees, and we believe that it continue to do so over the rest of
the year. In terms of what we [indiscernible] (00:48:23) in terms of Spain, partly performance, loans are starting to
reprice at lower rates, while deposits betas are behaving very well. This is helping contain the cost of deposits.
Also, as José explained you in detail, ALCO volumes are helping, and the lower cost of the hedging which were
not in place before are now in place. So it's going to help us. NII, as José said, is reaching its peak. But I expect
NII to grow mid-single-digits in 2024, better performance than we expected at the beginning of the year, and it's
also because of the higher for longer rates environment that we're experiencing. I don't know if José would like to
add something.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. In terms of details, Alvaro, I mean, it's first half against first half. NII in Spain is up 15%. So, if we grew zero
in the second half, the year-on-year would be around 7%. So, I don't understand where you get the minus 9%. If I
go quarter on quarter, NII in Spain – was started in the third quarter of last year, €174 million, fourth quarter €174
million, first quarter of this year, €182 million, second quarter, €184 million. We would expect the €184 million to
be the peak and then slightly down in the second half probably to very, very similar levels that we had in the
second half of last year, and we expect to be able to keep that same level in 2025.
In terms of capital, 20 to 30 basis points headwinds, taking into account that we generate 20 to 30 basis points
BAU, you should expect our capital ratio to be basically at these levels by year-end. The guidance of 12% is post
Basel III fully loaded.

Thank you very much. I've got a couple of follow-ups in the US. So, you're still struggling to deliver positive jaws.
When do you think things will turn around there? Do you think that we will see positive jaws in the second half of
the year? In the US as well, your P&L still remains pretty supported by tax credits. Can you help us understand
how the tax line will look like in the next few quarters? And then if I may ask, do you think the new reporting is
helping investors understand Santander better? Because judging by your low PE, I think not. So, I would like to
hear your thoughts there. Thank you.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 24-Jul-2024
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Marta. Okay. Let me explain you a little bit what's going on in the US. If you look it by business, you're
going to see the Retail is actually having lower cost than it used to have because of the transformation, even with
the strong investment we're doing in transformation. But we have done a really good cost reduction and we
believe we're going to perform better. The jaws are negative due to the fact that we're investing in CIB. And CIB,
as you understand, I mean, cost a lot to do it. So, if we're going to have a second half that is better, [ph] it is going
to (00:51:59) start looking better but it's going to depend on the cyclicality of the CIB business and some of the –
still people are coming into the team that will start to come in in the next few months.
As you know, there is a period of garden leave, et cetera, but the main reason is the investment we're doing in
CIB, which by in any way, is not creating a big investment bank or anything like that. This is basically, as we said,
complementing the rest of the business that we have. Our size is not going to be huge. It's the size of a really
small boutique but it's helping us out to beef up and to help us in the remainder of the business and you can see
fees are starting to basically be up due to that fact. Okay?
In terms of the P&L, it's quite easy to understand. The [ph] DTAs (00:52:48) are basically what we said last year
that when we started doing the electric vehicles, I mean, we signed contracts with some OEMs that are
generating these [ph] DTAs (00:53:00) and that's why you'll see that the P&L is affected by that and it's going to
continue due to the fact that we will continue to be absorbing, I mean, that volume. So, we have now three things.
And this is basically leases on electric vehicles that are creating the [ph] DTAs (00:53:16) in the US. All right? And
you're going to see that throughout the year.
In terms of the new reporting, it's very important to understand what we're doing. The new reporting is helping us
a lot in the way we are managing the business on a day-to-day basis, okay, because it's making us work together.
It's making us spend a lot less. In the past, for example, and let me give you a really stupid example. I mean, we
used to have 10, 11 different apps in 10 different banks. Right now, we're just having one app being deployed in
all the countries. For example, one app is being deployed today, it is being deployed in all of Europe. The last
deployment we did was UK. And [ph] they were deployed (00:54:02) in Brazil and then we will – we're deploying
also in the US. So, what happens is basically you use the same around 80/20, and that's the goal that we're
basically going through, investing just once and [ph] that's (00:54:16) 80% common, 20% customization per each
country.
So, that basically will enable us in the future through these global platforms to work much better in a much
cheaper way. We gave you a pretty good example in what we're doing in acquiring. When acquiring – when the
acquiring platform was deployed in Mexico, it took us in 18 months to number two. And you saw the results that I
explained, I mean, how EBITDA is growing and I showed you in the presentation that is helping us quite a lot in
terms of positioning ourselves to be very competitive and with really high margins in every single market. And it's
just one platform the one that is being deployed. Now, this platform is being deployed down to Chile, is being
deployed to Argentina and then we will deploy it in Europe in the near future. So, this is basically helping us to
work together and to manage the business in a much better way.
Then, in terms of how do you see the businesses and the way they are reporting, I mean, you're going to start
getting used to it because it's going to be a lot easier for you to understand every single business in the way we're
managing it. We're reporting now, as you can see, the operational leverage that we're getting by working together
in which revenue is going up, cost is staying stable and is giving us a really profitable run. So, it's very important
that you understand that.

Also, let me give you a great example. In CIB, where we have been working together for a long time, the same FX
factors that we use for Mexico, Brazil, Spain or the UK are completely the same and it's the same product and we
just made them once. So, that basically tells you how we're going to be able – I mean, how we have been able to
make it a really profitable business with growing revenue every single year and with profitability at around 19%
that I gave you. So, this is exactly the points that we're doing and I believe that this will enable us to give a lot
more value to our shareholders. There is no way we're going to give you more value if we don't work together and
do things in a much cheaper way.

Operator: Next question, from Francisco Riquel from Alantra. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Francisco Riquel Q
Analyst, Alantra Equities Sociedad de Valores SA
Yes. Thank you. So, two questions for me. The first one is on NII in Brazil. You still maintain the guidance of the
growth in the high teens for the year. Mid-teens would imply a quarter-on-quarter fall during the second half if you
think this could be the case or not, I mean, because SELIC rates have been – expectations of cuts have been
pushed out. So, if you can comment on the main drivers of the NII in the coming quarters and also update on the
sensitivity of the NII to SELIC rates in Brazil.
And the second question is about NII in the US. We have seen it's bottoming out in this second quarter, but [ph]
they (00:57:24) have also seen the deposits falling for a couple of quarters now. So, you would need to pay up for
deposit gathering in the second half of the year or not? In this context, if you can also comment on the plans to
launch Openbank? What shall we expect there? Because when I look, for example, at the Digital Consumer Bank,
the deposits are growing there by 20% but net interest margin is still falling despite the shift to retail deposits. So,
if you can comment also on this NII trends here. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Francisco. Let me start with Brazil. First of all, as you have seen, I mean, very strong and solid
numbers coming from Brazil. NII, once again, very strong quarter, up more than 3%, and is up more than 22% in
the year, okay? What's behind the performance is the combination of the healthy volume growth, the changing
mix and lower rates, okay? It is true. First of all, rates outlook has changed. The market is expecting smaller than
initially anticipated rate cut by the year – by year-end, and this ultimately mean that NII growth will be a bit less
intense than what we thought at the beginning of the year. That's a fact, okay?
Having said that, we still expect Brazil NII to grow in the mid-teens mark by the end of 2024. Okay? So, good
performance, that should continue in 2025. And let me tell you that – to take the opportunity that Brazil has
delivered a 16% RoTE. We believe that the end of the year should end up between 16% and 17%, strong
profitability improvement. It's not just relying on NII growth but on the good delivery on fees also, the cost
contention that we have had and expected cost of risk is stable during the year. So, I remain very optimistic in
Brazil and the ability to continue expanding the profitability as you have seen.
In terms of Openbank in the US, Openbank will come into the US with a deposit gathering facility towards
September, October, okay? We expect that to come. The first phase is deposit gathering. And I believe it would

be quite successful. We had a pretty good plan in place and then we'll come and we'll be improving the platform
as we see fit.
In terms of deposits, the deposits – the transactional deposits that SBNA has had remained stable during the
year. What you have seen the movement in deposits in the US is basically the deposits that we have in CIB,
which are the ones that we decide on profitability what's better for us or not. So, sometimes, because of
profitability, we basically let them go and we move as we see fit. So, there is no problem into that and we will
continue to see that work in profitability towards every business that we do.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
One quick comment on DCB Europe margins and profitability. The new business we wrote in 2021 was extremely
profitable. This was post-COVID and we have historically high profitability levels. This year is going to stay – this
production is going to stay in our books for three years. So, it's still in our books in 2024, it will gradually disappear
between 2024 and 2025. The new business that we are writing in 2024 is at RoTEs of around 20%, RoRWAs of
2.3%, 2.4%, which is much, much higher than 2022 and 2023 annual productions. So, you should expect in 2025
a very substantial pick-up in profitability in margins and in profitability in Consumer Europe because of these in
and out of the different productions and the fact that there was an abnormally high profitability in the year
following COVID.

Álvaro Fernández-Garayzábal Q
Analyst, UBS Europe SE (Spain)
Yeah. Hello. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I have two. First, we assume you're aiming for the
upper end of your RoTE target for next year. So, that is 17%, which implies some meaningful profit increase in
2025 versus 2024. So, my question is, geographically, where is that earnings growth going to come from? And
second, related to previous questions, we have seen revenues improving in the US over the last couple of
quarters with volumes up, customer spread expanding and fees coming quite strong. So, basically, how
sustainable is this revenue pick-up going forward? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Thank you, Álvaro. Let me start with the US. To tell you, I believe, I mean, the US revenue is going to
continue to do pretty well but the profitability is always the most difficult in the second part because of seasonality
in terms of what happens to us in provisions. So, what you're going to see is revenue continue to go up quite –
fairly strong. Let's see how we do in fees, as I said, due to the cyclicality of the CIB business but revenues will be
doing fine.
In terms of the seasonality, let's see how we do in terms of the provisions. But we believe – and the indication that
we have had in terms of provisions show us that they're coming better. The LTM numbers that we have in
provisions for the US are much better than last year. So, look – is looking well. And so, the US shall have a much
better year than last year. In terms of the RoTE and 17%, José, if you would like to comment.

José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. Obviously, we expect profitability to continue to increase on the back of increased [audio gap] (01:03:47).
Sorry. What I was saying is that we expect our profitability to continue to increase on the back of higher
operational leverage. Our transformation program is delivering very positive jaws that we expect to maintain
particularly in Consumer and Retail in 2025. The negative – the sensitivity to rates in Europe has been much
decreased, as I mentioned before, and we should have positive tailwinds coming from NII in South America, both
Brazil and Chile. So, definitely, operational leverage is what will continue driving increased profitability.
In terms of cost of risk, no signs of deterioration. And looking into the next few quarters, we see no signs that we
will require to increase our provisions going forward. So, if you put all of these together, again, this means that our
profits should continue to increase going forward.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Toms Q
Analyst, RBC Europe Ltd.
Good morning. Thank you, both, for taking my questions. The first one is on Brazil. You used €350 million gains to
top up your provisioning. I think that's the strategy we've adopted before, but how comfortable are you that you
will need – not need to do further top-ups in Brazilian cost of risk going forward? Another top-ups to catch up or
can we assume that the top-ups will mean a structurally lower cost of risk in Brazil in the coming years?
And then secondly, in the UK, in the deck, you mentioned that 100% of your hedge income is already locked in for
2024. This suggests that either you do not have any maturities this year or you pre-hedged some of your
maturities. If you have been pre-hedging, what proportion of 2025 structural hedge maturities have you pre-
hedged and what rates did you lock in at given that swap rates have been volatile? And do you expect the tailwind
from the structural hedge will overwhelm the headwinds on NII in the UK in 2025? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you. Okay. Let me go to Brazil, okay? First of all, it's very important to tell you that increase in provisions
exclusively linked to the loan growth that we have in the country, okay? Cost of risk, as you have seen, is flat
quarter-on-quarter, 4.77%, and credit quality in Brazil remains sound and solid. It's very important to understand
that the recent vintages that we have are performing very well and no signs of deterioration. So, it's performing
better than we expected.
It's very important to understand that we're also changing the mix a little bit on the portfolio. Just to explain a little
bit. For example, credit cards, where in 2021 we were making around 800,000 to 900,000 credit cards per month.
Today, we're just growing by 400,000 credit cards a month and just to our client base. So, the important thing and
the big change is exactly that we're not going to react to the open market which was the one that hurt us quite a
lot during [ph] 2022 and 2023 (01:07:26).

So, that's exactly the change of mix that is helping us. Also, it's very important to understand that we're very
focused on profitability and we have been very opportunistic and we used the proceeds of a corporate transaction
to further reinforce the balance sheet at this point. And we reiterate that the 2024 guidance of delivering is a
flattish cost of risk versus 2023, okay, excluding the one-offs. So, that's what I see in terms of Brazil.
In terms of the UK, José, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A

Yeah. So, as you know, obviously, the strategy is to keep the structural hedge position in line with core deposits
to protect the balance sheet ahead of decrease in interest rates. Following the recent increase in market rates
and in order to protect the NII, we have accelerated the planned investments for 2024, amongst other measures.
So, the sensitivity we have today is to a 100% decrease – parallel decrease in rates in the UK today is minus
£120 million compared to minus £220 million a year ago. So, roughly we have half of the sensitivity today that we
had a year ago. The current hedge – structural hedge is £114 billion compared with £106 billion in December. So,
this is related to my comment before with duration of 2.5 years. In December, it was – sorry, 2.5 years. In
December, it was 2.4 years, and the yield is slightly over 2%.

Carlos Peixoto Q
Analyst, CaixaBank BPI
Yes. Hi. Good morning. So, my first question will actually be a follow-up in Spain. And sorry [indiscernible]
(01:09:32) on this again. But did I understood correctly and the message was that in 2025, NII should be roughly
aligned with the second half of this year where you already expect NII to drop somewhat towards the mid-single
digit growth in the full year that you are mentioning?
And then my second question would actually be on the US EVs tax rebate that you have been booking. I was just
wondering if you could give us some color on how the rebate works in the sense that or basically for how long is it
in place? Is it something that we should also witness next year? And also, is it this federal level rebate or
something at a state level? And at what extent the potential changes – political changes in the US could drive that
to disappear or not? Just to have an idea on the timeframe for which this valid right now. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Carlos. All right. I mean, I think José gave a pretty good explanation of what's going on in terms of
how do we see now. I think it's important to understand what José explained you about what we're doing on the
hedges, the ALCO position that we have that will help also throughout the year. Even if the rates come down, I
think we're probably in the best ever position in that sense. And even that we say, I mean, the NII will slightly
come down over the second half and then we'll see that we will have a pretty good [indiscernible] (01:11:20) let's
see how rates basically behave. But I don't know, José, if you'd like to complement, but it's basically...

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 24-Jul-2024
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
It's exactly what I said. Carlos, it's exactly what you said. We expect NII to go down slightly in the second half of
the year. The year-on-year growth 2024 against 2023 will be somewhere between 5% to 7%. And then next year,
NII should be fairly flat relative to the second half of this year, which means that NII should be down slightly, low-
single digits...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos Peixoto Q
Analyst, CaixaBank BPI
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
...because again – and this is using the forward rate curves today. So, if this was to change, obviously we will
need to update these estimates. But using forward curve rates today, that's our best estimate for the NII in Spain
next year. And as Héctor mentioned, this is thanks to the substantial reduction in NII sensitivity that we have
conducted in the Eurozone in the last year, year and a half.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you. Carlos, okay, in the US, let me walk you through exactly what happens. Okay. First of all, let me tell
you that is federal, okay? We don't know if this is going to be sustained, if there is a change of government in the
US or not. I mean, I don't want to speculate on that one.
Exactly what happens is every single time we do a lease on an electric vehicle, we buy the vehicle in the bank,
okay? So, what you see is basically a situation in which we own the vehicle and then we get the cash back or the
tax credit, and you show the tax credit in one lumped, okay, during the month in which we do that, all right, to be
exactly how it goes. So, you don't see the impact in the revenue, but the impact you see it in the taxes. So, that's
exactly how it works.
I don't know if I'm being correct or – I mean, if I'm being clear in the way I'm explaining to you this, but it's exactly
how it works, all right? So, what we have done is we have a program what we have signed with the OEMs that
we're doing this for depends also the capacity that we have to absorb those [ph] DTAs (01:13:32) because this is
not, I mean, unlimited. This is not – I mean, we have to have – depends on the balance sheet that we have and
we have calculated the numbers actually that we can absorb, and this is exactly what we negotiate with the
OEMs. I don't know if you understood the question in the right way, but this is exactly how it works, okay? And we
don't know if it's going to happen in the future or not. Hopefully it continues to be like that.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 24-Jul-2024
Good morning, Héctor. Good morning, José. Thank you for taking my questions. I just have a couple of follow-
ups, please, on points we touched on before. Firstly, in the UK, your NII was slightly up quarter-on-quarter in Q2.
So, just wondering how you see this progressing from here. And is it fair to say that Q1 was probably the low point
on NII and it should start building from here supported the hedge? And what is the shape of this into H2 and also
into next year?
Secondly, just a clarification on your US business. You are talking about some seasonality into the second half of
the year in provisions. Could you please explain what is driving this seasonality?
And then lastly, for Brazil, also taking into consideration your comments about changing the mix of your business,
when do you expect to see a full normalization in cost of risk and around what level would this normalization be?
Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Thank you. Okay. So, as I said, in the UK, we see that we're going to have a second half better than the first half,
okay? Market is more rational both in the margins and in the betas. And on top of that, cost, as I said, is going to
be slightly better than the first half of the year. Q2 in NII is showing signs of improvement, okay, and as I basically
explained and we see that betas are not going to go up. So, that basically will help us.
In terms of revenue, we see mid to single digit decrease in NII, down mid-single digits versus last year, and fees
down low-double digit due to the fact that I was explaining about what we're doing with the switcher campaign and
[indiscernible] (01:16:00). You're going to see that is going to be much better in 2025 because exactly we're
preparing the bank towards that. Also, we're very focused on profitability. It's very important that you understand
that, okay? We're not using capital below our cost of equity. So, we're being very tough on that. That's exactly
why we manage that.
And then, José, I would you like to [indiscernible] (01:16:26).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. Sorry. One quick comment. The mortgage dynamics in the UK seem to suggest that margins in this
business will pick up substantially from the fourth quarter of this year into next year, just as an additional
comment. Brazil cost of risk, we still believe the cost of risk this year should be somehow below cost of risk last
year. Remember that when you look at cost of risk quarter-on-quarter, it was a bit substantial increase in the
fourth quarter when we look at year-on-year ex the fourth quarter and we look at cost of risk for the full of 2024,
we would expect to see an improvement in the cost of risk. So, year-on-year, because the fourth quarter will come
out – in the fourth quarter of this year, you should see the most significant improvement in cost of risk in the fourth
quarter. And then provisions in the US are normalizing. Cost of risk this year should be somehow around 2% or
slightly below 2%.

Q2 2024 Earnings Call 24-Jul-2024
Alberto Nigro Q
Analyst, Mediobanca SpA (United Kingdom)
Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a just a few follow-ups. The first one is on UK. If you can give us
more color on the contribution of the UK structural hedge in the second half of this year and in next year? And the
second one is again on Brazil, following your comment on the change of the loan mix, should we expect a
normalization of the cost of risk in the next year and see an absolute decline of total provision next year? Thank
you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Blas Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director, Banco Santander SA
Okay. In terms of Brazil, we're changing the loan mix, but we are very flexible and very dynamic in the way we
change the loan mix over there depending on what we are seeing and how the vintages are behaving, okay? So,
we see that Brazil basically and we're starting to see positive signs of how the mass market basically reacts is
inflation is coming down and we see the rates coming down, we might change the mix again and we might be a
little bit more aggressive.
And I couldn't tell you at this point what are we going to do because we revise the strategy every single month of
what we do and also the pricing, okay? So, I don't know what the mix is going to be in Brazil in 2025, but I must
tell you that we're working in a very dynamic way. It is a very dynamic market and you need to be on top of it, all
right? So, I couldn't tell you at this point. But, I mean, everything basically is – and we do change the mix to
sustain the cost of risk at reasonable levels and that's the intent that we have in order to manage that, all right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
So, UK NII, I think I gave you all the details to calculate that. I gave you the maturity, the rates, the amount and
everything else. In terms of cost of risk in Brazil, rates this year are expected to stay at 10.5% by year-end, but to
dropped significantly next year and that should help. In addition to the structure of the balance sheet, lower rates
next year in Brazil will help not only in terms of NII, but also cost of risk. It will be a gradual improvement. We
need to see exactly how we will build the business in 2025 in Brazil, but definitely lower rates should help.
