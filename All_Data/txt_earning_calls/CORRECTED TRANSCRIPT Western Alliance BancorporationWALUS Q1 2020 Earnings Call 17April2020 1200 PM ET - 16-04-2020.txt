President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. Good afternoon and welcome to Western Alliance's first quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today
are Dale Gibbons, and our Chief Credit Officer, Tim Bruckner. I will first provide an overview of Western Alliance's
response to the coronavirus pandemic, then Dale will walk you through the bank financial performance,
afterwards we will open the line to take your questions.
I'll begin by laying out Western Alliance's approach to the COVID and economic crisis. First and most importantly,
I hope that everyone on the line is doing well, and that your families and loved ones are safe and healthy. These
wishes are especially extended to all the care and safety workers actively putting themselves in harm's way to
protect our communities.
At Western Alliance Bank, our people remain healthy and engaged, and despite the vast majority working from
home for the last month, continue to go above and beyond the call of duty to serve our customers and the
communities we operate to navigate this challenging time.
Our business continuity plans have been working as anticipated, and I am proud of the entrepreneurial spirit our
people continue to demonstrate to get the job done and develop unique solutions for our clients.
First, I'd like to lay out the business actions Western Alliance has taken in light of the evolving environment.
Although we did not anticipate the widespread severity and likely duration of the virus, we did start assessing
potential risk and mitigants as early as mid-January. And as the breadth of the pandemic became apparent, we
accelerated implementing plans in mid-February to prioritize asset quality, capital, and liquidity management.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2020
We have since divided the business into appropriate risk segments led by senior managers with deep credit and
workout experience to monitor and foster earlier engagement with all borrowers and begin the necessary credit
triage process. For example, Robert Sarver is leading the Hotel Franchise Group, while I am leading the
Warehouse Lending and Gaming groups; Dale has Corporate Finance; and Tim Bruckner coordinates overseas
and directs all credit activities.
Our overall risk management approach is focused on establishing individual borrower level strategies in which we
are proactively engaging in customer conversations to evaluate and agree upon financial plans, focused on
liquidity management to conserve resources in anticipation of an elongated economic downturn. To-date, we've
had direct dialogue with all borrowers with over $3 million in exposure or 86% of our portfolio, and substantial
dialogue below this level. We assume that all borrowers will have some level of COVID-19 impact and are
focused on evaluating our borrowers' remediation efforts, access to capital and contingency plans.
We're also very pleased that Congress and the entire federal government came together to expeditiously pass the
CARES Act and stimulus measures a few weeks ago. Additionally, we applaud the Fed's actions to reduce
interest rates, support liquidity in the financial markets through quantitative easing for a wide variety of asset
classes and provide support for small and medium-sized businesses through its innovative new lending programs.
We recognize that the SBA has a large task in front of them and I'm extremely proud to say that our people work
tirelessly with them so that we could successfully process the PPP program loans on the first day.
We have dedicated over a quarter of our workforce to avail our clients of this important program and have
successfully approved over 2,600 applications totaling $1.5 billion to-date. We anticipate funding approximately
$150 million per day. As part of our broader risk management strategy, we have prioritized implementing the PPP
program, as the most expedient method to quickly get incremental liquidity to our clients.
Furthermore, we believe that the newly initiated Main Street Lending Program, when implemented, provides
incremental liquidity for our large clients as well as PPP participants. Our approach to loan modifications and
deferment requests is to look for resourceful ways to partner with our clients, along with assessing their
willingness and capacity to support their business interests.
We are asking our clients to work hand-in-hand with us for long-term solutions to hopefully short-term challenging
environment whereby our clients contribute liquidity, capital or equity, as an integral component to loan
modifications.
Our longer-term solutions-based approach distinguishes us from industry standardized 90-day deferral programs.
Our approach collectively uses the resources of the borrower, government, and the bank's balance sheet to
develop solutions that extend beyond six-month window provided for in the CARES Act.
This negotiation process has likely slowed our modification pipeline, as approximately $400 million has been
processed to-date. We learned during the last downturn when both the borrower and the bank use their resources
to bridge the gap, it generates a mutually favorable outcome.
With all of this as the backdrop, I'd like to walk through our financial performance for the quarter. Despite a
uniquely challenging operating rate environment, I am proud to report that in the first quarter Western Alliance
generated $163.4 million of operating pre-provision net revenue, up 10% year-over-year and 3% quarter-to-
quarter. We continued with the adoption of CECL accounting changes this quarter, which resulted in a provision

for credit losses of $51.2 million for the quarter, 47% of which was driven by our robust balance sheet growth.
Dale will go into more detail in a bit on how the unique features of CECL drove our provisions, but our ACL-to-
funded loan ratio now stands at 1.14%.
WAL generated net income of $84 million, or $0.83 per share, and tangible book value per share was $26.73.
This quarter, we produced a NIM of 4.22% and had net recoveries of $3.2 million and continue to improve our
operating leverage.
Even with our increased vigilance, organic balance sheet continued to be healthy in Q1 for both loans and
deposits. Deposits grew $2 billion to $24.8 billion as we gained market share in several of our key business lines,
as well as traction in one of our recently launched deposit initiatives, which added over $400 million. This
highlights the continued strength of our diversified funding channels and overall deposit franchise to generate
stable, low-cost liquidity irrespective of the macroeconomic environment.
Continuing on our strong momentum from 2019, total loans increased $2 billion to $23.1 billion. Approximately
$1.5 billion of this was through organic loan growth from new client projects and another $500 million was credit
line drawdowns, of which approximately half was re-deposited into the bank.
Let me take a moment now to make a few high-level comments on Western Alliance loan portfolio. We believe
that our well-diversified business model and purposeful decisions made over the past decade regarding
conservative underwriting criteria and sector allocations positioned the portfolio to withstand the current economic
environment. At quarter end, asset quality was stable, with a decline in totally adverse graded loans and OREO to
assets of 1.2% from 1.27% in Q4.
Western Alliance has no direct energy or large retail mall exposure. We stopped making loans to the quick service
restaurants sector several years ago, with current exposure of only $150 million. Our construction and land and
development portfolio is now under 9% of our loan book. In our institutional lot banking business, which makes up
30% of the CLD portfolio, we have not received any deferral requests at this time. Single family residential
construction, which composes another 27%, was still experiencing positive absorption trends through March.
However, April's traffic has fallen off.
That portfolio was extremely well-positioned coming into the pandemic and right now is performing as expected.
We are especially focused on monitoring and engaging with our clients in our hotel franchise finance and
technology and innovation segments, which will be reviewed in more detail later in the call.
During the quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares at an average price of $35.30. Additionally, consistent with
our 10b5 plan, we purchased 270,000 shares thus far in Q2. However, given the rapidly changing environment,
we have now paused our share repurchase activity.
Finally, Western Alliance arrives at this crisis in a position of strength, uniquely prepared to address what's ahead.
We remain well capitalized and highly liquid with a CET1 ratio of 9.7% and ample liquidity – total liquidity
resources of over $10 billion.
Dale will now take you through our financial performance.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2020
For the first quarter, Western Alliance generated net income of $84 million, or $0.83 earnings per share. Net
income was reduced by a $51.2 million provision for credit losses, driven by the adoption of CECL, balance sheet
growth as well as the change in the economic outlook due to the pandemic.
Strong ongoing balance sheet momentum, coupled with diligent expense management drove operating pre-
provision net revenue to $163.4 million, up 10% from a year ago, which we believe is the most relevant metric to
evaluate the ongoing earnings power of the company.
Net interest income and fee income remain relatively stable, producing net operating revenue of $285.3 million,
primarily a result of lower yields on loans, which was partially offset by lower rates on deposits and borrowings.
Non-interest income declined $10.9 million to $5.1 million from the prior quarter due to mark-to-market of
preferred stock holdings of primarily large money center banks of $11.3 million, partially offset by $3.8 million
equity investment gain. To-date, of the $11.3 million marked, $3.5 million has been recovered.
As credit spreads widened during the last quarter, the yield on preferred stocks followed impacting valuations. We
do not believe this represents a permanently reduced valuation and that preferred stock values will continue to
recover over time. Finally, non-interest expense declined $9.3 million as compensation and other operating
expenses declined by $7 million.
Regarding implementing CECL in our allowance for credit losses, in our 10-K, we disclosed the adoption impact
of $37 million, $19 million of which was attributable to funded loans, $15 million for unfunded commitments and
$2.6 million for held-to-maturity securities. This resulted in a combined January 1 allowance of $214 million.
During Q1, loan growth drove an additional $24 million of required reserves and another $30 million was driven by
changes in the economic outlook as a result of the pandemic. In total, reserve build during the first quarter was
$91 million, an increase of 50% from the yearend reserve. The quarter-end ACL of $268 million was 1.14% of
funded loans, up 30 basis points.
Provision expense for the quarter was $51.2 million, which is over 10 times the average quarterly provision during
2019. As of March 31, the reserve build reflects our best estimate of the future economic environment, including
the impact of government stimulus programs. We utilized an assimilation of various Moody's macroeconomic
outlook scenarios to capture the most likely economic outcomes in a more severe scenario for potential tail risks.
As the economy continues to change, we will adjust our ACL modeling accordingly.
Turning now to net interest drivers, net interest income for the quarter declined a modest $3 million from the prior
quarter to $269 million as there was one less day during the quarter compared to Q4 and margin compression
was offset by loan and deposit growth. Investment yield showed a modest improvement of 2 basis points from the
prior quarter to 2.98%. However on a linked quarter basis, loan yields increased 31 basis points due to the lower
rate environment.
The average yield of our portfolio at quarter-end or the spot rate was 5.02%. Interest-bearing deposit costs
increased 18 basis points in Q1 to 90 basis points as a result of immediate steps taken to reduce our deposit
costs after the FOMC cut rates twice in March. The spot rate of total deposits at quarter end was 29 basis points.
Total funding costs decreased 11 basis points when all of the company's funding sources are considered,
including non-interest bearing and borrowings.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2020
Through the transition to a substantially lower rate environment during the quarter, net interest income was $269
million, a decline of 1.1% from Q4. Continued strong balance sheet growth and immediate steps taken to reduce
the cost of interest-bearing deposits counteracted the decline in prime and LIBOR.
Net interest margin declined 17 basis points to 4.22% during the quarter as our earning asset yield fell 28 basis
points, partially offset by 19 basis points funding cost decrease.
With regards to our asset sensitivity, our rate risk profile has declined notably as the majority of our variable rate
loan portfolio has flipped to fixed rate as floors have been triggered in the declining rate environment. Presently
82% or $8.1 billion of variable rate loans with floors are at the floors.
With the addition of our mix to shift primarily to fixed rate residential loans, $16.2 million or 70% of loans are now
behaving as a fixed rate portfolio. This has reduced our interest rate risk and a 100 basis point parallel shock
lower scenario to 3% at March 31 from 6.5% one year ago, and assumes that rates are held flat at zero across
the term structure.
Turning now to operating efficiency, on a linked quarter basis, our efficiency ratio decreased 200 basis points to
41.8%. As mentioned earlier, the improvement was attributed to decreases in compensation and other operating
expenses, while our revenues increased modestly. As a core component of our strategy, we continue disciplined
expense management to sustain industry-leading operating leverage and profitability.
Our core underlying earnings power remains strong as pre-provision net revenue ROA was 2.38%, flat from the
prior quarter, while return on assets was down 70 basis points to 1.22%, directly related to our provision expense
and excessive charge-offs of $54.4 million.
As Ken mentioned earlier, our strong balance sheet momentum from 2019 continued into Q1. During the quarter,
loans increased $2 billion to $23.2 billion and deposits also grew $2 billion to $24.8 billion. Loan to deposit ratio
increased to 93.2% from 92.7% in the fourth quarter.
Our strong liquidity position continues to provide us with balance sheet capacity to meet funding needs.
Shareholders' equity declined by $17 million as dividends and share repurchases were matched by net income.
Tangible book value per share increased $0.19 over the prior quarter to $26.73 per share as our share count
declined.
We continue to believe our ability to profitably grow deposits is both a key differentiator and a core value driver to
our platforms' long-term value creation. Q1 is a seasonally strong deposit quarter and coupled with the rollout of
our deposit initiatives, deposits grew $2 billion. The increase was driven by growth of $1.3 billion in non-interest
bearing DDA primarily from market share gains in our mortgage warehouse operations.
Additionally, HOA continues to perform well and contributed $330 million of low-cost deposits. During the quarter,
the relative proportion of non-interest bearing DDA grew to nearly 40% of deposits from 37.5% on a linked quarter
basis.
Turning to loan growth, in line with the industry, the vast majority of growth was driven by increases in C&I loans
totally $1.8 billion, followed $107 million in construction and land development, and $92 million in residential.
Residential loans now comprise 9.7% of our portfolio, while construction loans decreased as a relative proportion
of the portfolio to 8.9% from 9.2% in the fourth.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2020
At the segment level, Tech & Innovation loans grew $626 million, with $124 million from capital call and
subscription lines, and $176 million from existing technology loan draws, in turn bolstering technology-related
deposits by $383 million.
Corporate finance loans grew $408 million, which was primarily due to line draws, two-thirds of which were from
investment grade borrowers, bringing utilization rates to 38% from 13% during the prior quarter.
Mortgage warehouse also contributed loan growth of [ph] $550 million (00:20:12), approximately 50% of which
was due to the line draws. Across the bank, one quarter or about $500 million of our net new loan growth was
driven by drawdowns on existing loan commitments from the beginning of the quarter. In all, total loan growth of
$2.2 million for the quarter was fully funded by deposit growth with the same amount.
Overall, asset quality was stable during the quarter with total adversely graded assets increasing $10 million
during the quarter to $351 million, while non-performing assets comprised of loans on non-accrual and
repossessed real estate increased $27 million to $97 million or 0.33% of total assets, and is now is held for sale.
Within these categories, we had migration from special mention to substandard as some of the normal investor
funding was delayed in Tech & Innovation. As a precaution, when remaining liquidity declines below six months,
we bring those loans into either special mention or sub for enhanced monitoring and engagement.
This quarter we saw the cumulative impact of our efforts in managing certain special mention and substandard
loans and several were resolved in our favor with no losses. $100 million of adversely graded loans resolved
during the past quarter, 37 loans or $50 million paid off in full, while the other $50 million were upgraded to pass.
As Ken mentioned in his introduction, we're well-positioned entering this economic cycle. We only incurred
$100,000 of gross credit losses during the quarter, which was more than offset by $3.3 million in recoveries
resulting in net recoveries of $3.2 million.
We typically have one or two one-off credit charges every quarter. However, highlighting the strength of our loan
book, we didn't experience any of these in Q1. We believe early indication in identification and conservative
management helps mitigate losses on these assets. In all, the ACL-to-funded loans increased 30 basis points to
1.14% in Q1 as a result of CECL adoption and the resulting provision expense related to Q1 loan growth and
changes in the economic outlook.
We continue to generate capital and maintain strong regulatory capital ratios with tangible common equity-to-total
assets of 9.4%, and a CET1 ratio of 9.7%. In Q1, a reduction of TCE-to-total assets was mainly driven by $2.3
billion increase in tangible assets due to our significant loan growth, while the tangible common equity was
affected by [ph] $15.4 million (00:22:52) of provisions in excessive charge-offs due to CECL adoption. In spite of
reduced quarterly earnings and the payment of quarterly cash dividends of $0.25 per share, our tangible book
value per share rose $0.19 in the quarter $26.73, and is up 15.2% in the past year.
Our diversified deposit generation platform and access to significant liquidity resources is critical in times of
economic stress. Overall, we have access to over $10 billion in liquidity, primarily through our $4.7 billion
investment portfolio, of which $2.7 billion are investment grade, readily marketable and not pledged on any
borrowing base. Additionally, we have $7 billion in unused borrowing capacity with the Fed, Federal Home Loan
Bank and correspondent. Our strong capital base, access to liquidity and diversified business model will allow us
to address any credit demands in the future.

I'll now hand back the call to Ken to conclude with comments on a few of our specific portfolios.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Thanks, Dale. Regarding our Hotel Franchise Finance business, we believe our focus on the select-service
subsegment, conservative loan to cost underwriting discipline and strong operating partner sets us up for a
maximum financial flexibility to weather the duration of the crisis. Like most hotels in the country, our clients have
seen a dramatic reduction in occupancy rates over the last month. And senior management is involved in active
dialogue with each borrower to evaluate remediation efforts and contingency plans. Going into the pandemic,
75% of the portfolio had an LTV under 65%, and more than 73% had a debt service coverage ratio of 1.3 times.
Additionally, we only partner with experienced hotel operators with significant invested equity and resources to
support ongoing operations. Fully 66% of the portfolio is with large sponsors who operate more than 25 hotels,
and 90% operate 10 or more properties with top franchise or flags. Based on our ongoing constructive dialogue,
we believe that sponsors view this as a temporary event and want to continue to maintain and support these
properties over the long term, given their significant equity investments. We are actively working with them to
appropriate utilize the PPP program and the Main Street Lending Programs, along with their own liquidity as a
helpful financial bridge to arrive at a longer-term solution. Based on the mutually developed financial action plans,
we will selectively implement loan modifications along the lines we previously discussed. This is a prime example
where both parties contribute to a comprehensive solution.
Now, regarding our Tech & Innovation business, we primarily finance established growth technology firms with a
strong risk profile mainly companies classified as Stage 2 with an established business model, validated product,
multiple rounds of investment, and a path to profitability. This provides greater operating and financial flexibility in
times of stress. 99% of the borrowers have revenues greater than $5 million and have strong institutional backing
with 86% backed by one or more VC or PE firms.
During the quarter, the portfolio grew $495 million to $2 billion or 8.8% of the total portfolio, which was attributed
to $175 million of existing line drawdowns in the technology division, and an additional $124 million from capital
call lines, a product that historically has had zero losses.
Tech & Innovation commitments grew $284 million in Q1, and utilization rates increased to 60% from 49% in Q4
2019. The portfolio is fairly granular with average loan size of $6 million, and these borrowers are generally liquid
with more than 2:1 deposit coverage ratio. Additionally, since 2007, warrant income has covered cumulative net
charge-offs 2 times over. Currently, 14% of technology loans or $164 million has less than six months remaining
liquidity, which is in line with historical trends. Although some fundraising has been delayed, we were pleased to
see several investment rounds closed over the last several weeks and days with strong continued sponsored
support.
In conclusion, we see increased cash generation driven by our balance sheet momentum going into the quarter-
end, as well as continued loan growth from the PPP distributions. We expect pre-provision net revenue to
continue to grow through Q2 with the ability to absorb any necessary future provisions. Given uncertainty
surrounding the likely duration of the virus and evolving economic environment, we will continue to reassess our
outlook as health and economic facts warrant.
Regarding asset quality, our proactive risk management approach is institutionalized throughout the company.
We are actively working with our borrowers to develop mutually agreed upon financial plans assuming an
elongated economic downturn that leads to long-term solutions. Our strong collateral positions and little

unsecured or consumer lending should serve us well in mitigating potential risk of loss, as we navigate these
uncertain times. We stand ready to implement the likely next phase of PPP and the Main Street Lending Program
to assist our clients and communities.
Finally, Western Alliance has assembled a seasoned management team that has weathered several economic
downturns, and is applying the lessons learned from the Great Recession to face these uncertain economic times.
And with that, we'll open up the line, operator, and we'll take everyone's questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today
comes from Casey Haire of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Hey, Casey.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Just question on the reserve build, obviously a tricky proposition here, but trying to get a – you guys mentioned
the use of a bunch of Moody's scenarios, could you just give us some color as to how much weighting was given
to the Moody's adverse scenario, what kind of recovery you guys are assuming, how much government help, the
stimulus stuff that the government is doing is offsetted, and then obviously the duration. I know that's a lot, but just
trying to get some color as to the magnitude of reserve build here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. So, we primarily used the baseline case as of March 31, and then we looked at S1 and we looked at S3. S3
is the kind of the adverse scenario, which is obviously more critical and a longer recovery period. We do struggle
with what is the timeline of this type of thing and how much the things come back. We do think that the institutions
and the plans done by the federal government and both on the congressional side, as well as the FOMC have an
effect in terms of being able to mitigate this and make a bridge to when we're at a time when we can start to turn
the economy back on. I don't have a timeline for you in terms of kind of when that is going to be, but we will look
at this, we're fully reserved as of March 31, and we'll look at this again at the end of the second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. I would just add and say we did factor in some impact of the PPP program. But as we were processing, we
didn't know what that size level was going to be. So, having 2,600 participants over $1.5 billion looking to go out is
going to be very helpful, I don't think it's been fully factored into our reserve calculations, but that $1.5 billion will

help cover $6.7 billion of commitments in our company or $4.6 billion of current outstanding loans, which means
that's about 20% of our current portfolio.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Great. And just following up on the loan modifications. If I heard you right, I think you said $400 million to
date. So, just specifically, what exactly are you guys doing there, and then like any color as to how much you've
improved upon that $400 million as of April 17 here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. By the way, that $400 million is April 17 number.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Okay? Number two, I would say in terms of color, I think we caught a lot of our clients by surprise, our borrowers
by surprise when we said early on, this is going to be a longer-term problem, and let's have a longer-term solution
rather than the standardized cookie-cutter 90-day P&I deferral. And by the way, that took a lot of getting used to
from our client base, and we had to go back to them several times. As we've had that conversation, you can see
that our viewpoint is more likely than not going to be correct. We don't know how long it's going to go. But we
said, let's start with figuring it out and through the end of the year. And because of that, we need you, the
borrower, to contribute something with more equity, more collateral, more liquidity to the project. And then, we will
help you along with the deferral as well. And we took each loan on a case-by-case basis, and we didn't make
broad proclamations that said, we'll just do 90 days here. So, every loan has been different, and I assume as we
get into questions about different books of business, I'll give you some stories behind each one all those books of
business.
But we think getting out there and dealing with our clients on a one-to-one basis is going to be helpful. And by the
way, the same lessons that we learned in the Great Recession by getting there early, having conversations for the
longer term helps our clients survive, but more importantly, they know that we'll be there when they start to see
growth opportunities, and the combination of their growth opportunities, the ability to get through this, gives them
the ability to prosper longer term. And that's our approach when we sit down and we talk to our client's case.

Okay. Great. Just last one from me. You guys clearly prioritizing the PPP program for loan growth. Just a
question, how are you guys funding this, just trying to get a sense for what the incremental NIM might be, and
regarding capital and liquidity, are you willing to go much higher on the loan-to-deposit ratio and as well as on the
TCE ratio?

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2020
So, you may have noticed our ending balances for loans and deposits were significantly above the average
balance for the first quarter. So, we had $1.7 billion more in loans and $1.5 billion more in deposits, two-thirds of
the deposit number was in DDA. That gives us, we think, momentum in terms of expanding PPNR into 2Q. You
layer this $1.5 billion then on top of that, we have a myriad of ways to be able to fund this, one is we think we
have additional deposit opportunities, two is the Federal Reserve has said they'll advance 100% on these loans,
and three we have another $10 billion of liquidity that we could get elsewhere. So, we're not really concerned
about funding that cost. I think it's going to be something around 25 basis points, if we put it to the Fed it's 35
basis points to do that, and we'll take these in. So that again, I think, shows that we expect continued balance
sheet growth into the second quarter primarily driven by these PPP notes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. And if I'm understanding the PPP, it comes on at around 2% with the fees associated, so it looks like about
1.75% incremental margin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah, so...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Is that right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
...our weighted fee on the $1.5 billion we've done is 2.4%, and then these loans – I mean, the preponderance of
this is clearly short term, we're going to call it six months. But then for the part that isn't forgivable, that has a tail
that goes out two years.

Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
The actual loan rate on the entire program was 1%. So, you get 2.4% on the entire bucket, and some of that is
going to be accelerated in terms of recognition based upon the short-term nature of the forgivable element.

Arren Cyganovich Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thanks. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the working with the customers, I appreciate all the
commentary. I guess, I just want to have a better understanding of what proportion of your customers are actually
getting deferrals now, and how that – how those are categorized relative to the modifications that you're
discussing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
I'm going to ask Tim Bruckner, our Chief Credit Officer, to take that one.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Right. Thank you. And this is, I think, a nice follow-on to the discussion we've just had. In the prioritization of this,
the customer conversation, that dialogue, is of top priority. So, that started for us back in February. We've got two
parts to this that have come into our common language, there's the trough and then there's the recovery and
stabilization and a new normal. As a bank and as a business, we know that the better that we do and the better
that we help our borrowers through that trough in terms of proper planning, the better that asset stabilizes in the
new normal. So, the conversations are actually going very, very well, but there is obvious differences between
borrowers and industries and businesses. And so necessarily, there is different conversations and discussions.
But what that lets us do as a business is then monitor that cash and liquidity through the trough, and be best
positioned in the recovery and in stabilization and normal, whatever it is for their business. And so, it's really a
dialogue that started in February, and it'll continue throughout this entire process. PPP is just part of it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
So, this is Ken. Let me just – it's an interesting question that you asked because there's not one singular answer
for the entire portfolio, it depends which portfolio you're talking about. But maybe some color behind the portfolios
would be helpful here. So, for example, we're talking to everyone in the hotel book, right, that's HFF. That's $2
billion. Well, 50% of those clients – 50% of our clients have already made their P&I for April, and then 80% of the
remaining 50% are in deep conversations with us where we hope that we'll have something tied down in the next
couple of weeks in terms of a modification program, and then they'll make their payments at that time or maybe
they'll extend first, and then we'll get some payments after that. So, that's the – that's the hotel book, and that's
how the conversation is going there.
The conversation, say, in lot banking is quite different. We're actually getting inbound calls, and we're – and
people are asking us, are you going to be there when we find the opportunities. And then our question is, well, are
you looking for deferments, and we've had a couple deferrals, we've had a couple of clients call in and say, I'm
not going to ask for anything, I'm looking at the future, I need you to stand with us. So, those are just two different
ways the book is different. Our gaming book, okay, is completely different than what's happening. We think are
gaming book other than five or six small deferrals that we made on principal, we think our overall gaming book
has enough liquidity to survive into the summer. I would just – so that makes our conversation there a little bit
different. We can take a little bit more time. We can see how the Main Street Lending facility can be accessed
because the gaming companies could not access the PPP program.
So, every different segment of our book has a different conversation. And that's why if I can reiterate again, and
Tim was very early on this in our – and we do a weekly senior operating committee meeting, but in the second or

third week of January, he just stood up and said, okay, we're going to have senior leaders be in charge of books
of business across the entire company that have workout experience, heavy credit experience, have been
through something like this, and therefore we can tell each discussion differently. That's – for example, Robert
running the hotel business. Robert was born with hotel business in his veins. Why wouldn't he take that on and
run with that. All right. And so, we looked for different strengths to match up against the portfolio here.
I'm sorry, it's a longer answer, but I hope we gave you some color as to how we're managing our conversations
with our clients.

Operator: The next question today comes from Brock Vandervliet of UBS. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Thanks. Good morning. Just bigger – big picture to start, do you think this is going to be a mild or severe
recession in the scale of recessions that you've – that we've experienced in the past?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Well, my answer keeps evolving as information evolves. And I try not to be tick by tick, but certainly more
pessimistic than I was in early March and mid-March. Given that 22.5 million people have recently filed for
unemployment claims. So, I think it's going to be deeper than I've ever experienced, all right. But I think, our
answers or our approach was one that we anticipated that it was going to be longer than what people thought, we
just didn't think the severity of what we're seeing was going to be as deep.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And more specifically around investors' real concerns here, for the hotel book, like what percentage of
properties would you say go bankrupt in an average recession? And would...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Okay. So... I'm sorry, Brock. I didn't mean to cut you off.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Okay. So, we went back and we looked at the GE – this was originally the GE business. And we bought it in GE –
from GE in 2016. So, we went back and we looked at their performance level from 2007 to 2015. And during that
time, during those eight years, total losses amounted to $52 million, average charge-off of 60 basis points with

peak losses coming in 2010 at 3.3%. They had a portfolio of about $1 billion in size. Now what's important to note
is their portfolio was completely different than the model that we constructed. Their portfolio was more of a
shotgun approach, they had weak flags, we do not, they had small operators, we do not, they had weak sponsors,
we do not. And they had LTVs of 75%, and our LTV as I said earlier are about 60%. So, we have a different
model than what they have. But that's our best look back to get a gauge of what may happen going forward,
adjusting for the difference of our models.
Tim, do you want to add anything?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Western Alliance Bancorporation
I just want to add one thing to that is, I think if you really look at it to our sponsorship and sophistication of investor
composition is a lot different than that legacy portfolio as well. We really have the larger operators, the higher
level of sophisticated investor when we have these dialogues and say, come on, we're solving for something here
that isn't 90 days. We have folks that understand why and how we can work together and do that. And that's
going to keep the leverage down on this portfolio. How we do on that, puts us in the position and the rebound that
we want to be in.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
And lastly, the debt service coverage ratios that you show on page 20, are those as of Q1 or are those through
April because clearly hotel performance has gotten deteriorated?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. No, there're for Q1, Brock. We wouldn't have that information that quickly for April.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2020
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Good morning, Brad.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Ken, I think you gave the stat on the tech book that 14% of the companies had cash on hand for six months or
less, which was pretty consistent with history. I was curious, if you can give that same kind of stat for the hotel
book. Obviously, I know that the PPP program is having an impact there as well, but just kind of want to get any
kind of sense on kind of the forward look on debt service coverage for that book if you could look at it in a similar
way to – as you look at the tech book?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Well, I don't have the stat on what the collective liquidity is for the hotel book. We are – that is one of the single
most important questions we ask our clients and it's – we're gathering that information as we speak. They
generally don't run with a lot of liquidity. And now here's my however, my however is if you are a recently opened
hotel, which we have a couple, they have liquidity because they had that liquidity on their balance sheet getting
ready for the opening. So, they're okay. If you're a hotel that was building up your reserve do a PIP, you have
some of that liquidity. If you're a hotel that's been operating for a while, and distributions have gone back to your
investors, you have less, and therefore we have to talk to you, we go to the investors, we get a capital call to
come for you to get a defer – to get some deferral.
So, a little bit different, and that's why one of the things that if I can keep repeating here case by case, individual
hotel by individual hotel, and – or individual property throughout the whole book of business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brad Milsaps Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And just maybe a follow-up – two follow-ups. One, how large is the gaming book? And then secondly, I
think at the end of last year, you had about $8.5 billion of unfunded commitments in total for the whole loan
portfolio. Can you talk about the potential for those to be drawn down maybe where you've cut those two and
amplifications of that without add-on capital?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
So, I'll take the easy question, and then I'll flip it over to Dale for the harder one. The simple answer is $500
million on gaming.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. So, the most significant draw we've ever had on unfunded has been 8% of that amount, which frankly we
got close to kind of where we were with this drawdown. We're not seeing any more additional draws at this time.
We're – in fact, we've had some kind of repayments of some of those draws. So, we don't see – and a lot of these
draws, they're – I mean, they're or these commitment lines, we don't think they would really kind of ever be drawn
down in terms of the structure behind some of these credits. So, while we have these unfunded elements to them,
and we did have a drawdown in March predominantly, we're not seeing anything else subsequent to that.

Operator: The next question today comes from Chris McGratty of KBW. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Hey, Chris.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Hey, Dale. Quick question on just the balance sheet trajectory. Given the comments about the gross and
the draws, any thoughts on adjusting the resi mortgage strategy a bit just in light of the capital and liquidity?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
So, the resi – the purchase of resi mortgages may be far more opportunistic right now than we've ever seen as
some of our clients are selling their mortgages at significant discounts, which will allow us to go ahead and buy at
higher yields than we bought in Q1. So, we're going to look at that. The keyword we used to use or we used for
our share repurchase was opportunistic, same thing here. If we can get the right risk reward tradeoff, in fact
there're resi mortgages available that have better or lower LTVs, lower DTIs and higher FICO scores that are
selling for much higher yields than we recently purchased, say, at the end of 2019. So, we'll look at that, and if
there's opportunity there, we're going to take advantage of it.
I think an important thing on this program as well as on the hotel book is collateral. I mean, we are in strong
collateral positions such that it would take considerable sustained valuation declines to ever pierce where we are
in terms of risk of loss.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And just if I can follow up, Dale, in terms of the CET1 or the tangible. Obviously, this quarter had a big jump
down just because of the growth. Where do you comfortably run those ratios in this environment over the next few
quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Well, I mean, so, we saw a decline in those two. Now with the PPP program, that could pull down our TCE. It
really won't have an effect on CET1 because those are all 0% risk weight as they're SBA backed. But we can see
this number come down 8s.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2020
Okay. And then, maybe a last one if I could do it. The color on the hotel history of loss is great. Could you do a
similar run through of the tech book in terms of peak losses when you didn't own it, I think they were kind of in the
mid-single digit in their early stage, but just blended I think they're around 2%, 3%, any color would be great?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Your recollection is correct. I don't have those in front of me, but we'll pull them up as you know they're available
on SNL.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. Last time I looked at it, and it was a while ago and it wasn't for this particular situation, as I said in my
prepared remarks, there is a 2 times coverage of the warrant income to the credit losses. And as you know, credit
losses come early and the warrant income comes later, but when you look at it overall that the warrant income
that we get has always covered the – more than covered the credit losses, unfortunately we – it just can't be timed
to be in the same quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
I think it's also notable that our mix has changed since then as well. So – we're now doing – a significant portion
of our growth has been in these capital call and subscription lines. It's not something that Bridge was engaged in
as a standalone enterprise, but something that we entered as part of our risk mitigation strategy, essentially last
year, to really lend into areas that have had zero to no losses historically for not just us but for other participants in
the space.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Let me give you some color as part of our review, just so you know, I'll speak for Tim Bruckner for a second, but
every Monday at my SO, Senior Operating Committee meeting, we set the tone for what we're going to try to
accomplish that week, that month, that quarter and so forth depending on the circumstances. And then we run
two senior loan committees on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Basically we're not really approving senior loan
packages, but we are reviewing large credits that are being worked on for modifications.
And then Tim holds individual weekly meetings with each one of our risk segments. So, we're daily talking to a
segment and getting live information. So, on the Tech & Innovation, which is as live as I can get it, I was asking
the credit officer there last night, how would you describe our book of business? And the way he just said – what
he said was, I see rating turbulence, but I don't see large losses. So, things can move around in terms of pass,
not pass but at this point the book is behaving well, at this point.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timothy R. Bruckner A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah, I might add just one more point to that. We've seen the support from the sponsorship, we're in these
transactions at a low loan-to-value with a number of rounds typically in front of us before we're in. And so what
we're seeing is if anything takes a hit here, it's a hit on valuation before it impacts our loan. So, the rounds are
clearing. The funding is occurring. The valuations might be slightly lower but the capital still flowing in this
segment and that gives me some comfort.

Hi. Good morning.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Maybe for Dale first, you had indicated that you're starting to see some of the utilization come back. Is that in the
technology book as well, or are those utilization rates still increasing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Our utilization rates are fairly stable from where we are right now on both sides, both on the Tech & Innovation as
well as in the corporate finance area.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then of the 14% of the tech loans, which have six months or less of liquidity, have any of those been
funded up in the last couple of weeks, or was your commentary in the prepared remarks for other relationships?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
No. What's there now has not been funded up. We had a couple of sponsors put money into a couple projects,
right, before the end of the quarter, which was helpful to us. But overall, that number has been relatively steady in
Bridge's history. But we are encouraged by what we're seeing away from us with sponsors completing their
rounds. We actually had credit that wasn't in any trouble in our life science yesterday, they got a substantial
amount of sponsor financing. So, we're not seeing it – we're not seeing the sponsor financing run away from us,
or run away from the industry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then just one more on the loan modification, it looks like at least through quarter end the majority of it
was within your Arizona and Nevada portfolios. I guess, what's driving that, is that forbearance on residential
loans, or why such a high number out of those two geographies?

Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
It's really the pace and cadence of those customer discussions. Those discussions drive that – the discussion
results in an assessment of liquidity, liquidity necessary to bridge the trough, in some cases that liquidity already
exists, the solution which may include some form of modification is tailored to the liquidity goal, so it's really just
the pace and cadence of those discussions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Timur F. Braziler Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then last question for me for you Ken, with your commentary that you are a little more pessimistic now
than you were in mid-to-late March. I'm just wondering how that correlates with using the baseline Moody's
assumption for allowance. Should we see another tick higher for adjustment on the existing portfolio, or at this
time are you still comfortable with the $30 million that was provided for the existing book in detail?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
So, I'm comfortable with the provision that we provided at quarter end based on everything we knew at that time,
right? I'm sorry, I just had a senior moment. Second part of your question was...
[indiscernible] (00:58:04)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. Dale, do you want to take that or...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Well, so obviously this seems to change almost by the hour in terms of what the expectations are. And since then
we've had some worse news. We've had north of 20 million people file for unemployment. We maybe got teased
with some good news with last night with a treatment that looks like it's going to be – proved to be efficacious for
this. In the next 75 days, my guess is there's going to be a lot more news. And so we're going to reassess this at
the end of June in terms of what that looks like.
If we can get things back in some track upward again in terms of the economic outlook, I could see things getting
better. If that's not the case, if we're still doing kind of in this lockdown phase, I don't think that's – we're probably
looking at additional provision in the second quarter. Can't really say right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. I just, I'm sorry, recaptured my thought, I froze there for a moment thinking, but I think what's going to be
surprising to folks is that the pace of charge-offs are going to be – or the cycle is going to be pushed out and
elongated because of the PPP program and because of the Main Street Lending facility. And I think people – I
think investors will be surprised that there aren't heavy charge-offs coming early on. Maybe on some of the
smaller businesses, you would expect to see them, but on some of the larger credits, I don't see charge-offs
coming to the back part of the year if they come at that time, right?

we'll then determine what we need to do as we look forward at the end of Q2.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, thanks for that comment, Ken. I was just going to ask about that but maybe, we'll go at it different way with
provision. So, Dale, I think what you're saying is things are a little better by June or July that $30 million
incremental in the provision would go away for Q2. Is that the right way to think about it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Well, I wouldn't necessarily say that, that $30 million would be reversed. I mean if the outlook at the end of June is
similar to what it was at the end of the first quarter, I think that there's no additional amount given for deterioration
of credit conditions. So, I think that holds with that $30 million. For that to be released back in the income, I think
we probably have to get to a farther period down the road and say, you know what, we actually are well on our
way toward reducing our unemployment rate, we're bringing people back in, and so the outlook is better than kind
of what is the base case for Moody's at the end of the first quarter. And which that has an extended return. I mean
that's – some of that really is held down through 2021. If instead you get back to something that resembles more
of – pick your letter right, a V or a U instead of like a lazy U or an L, I think there is a possibility that you could
release that.
I think what Ken said was we're not really expecting to experience charge-offs if and when they come until after
these periods of the PPP program, the Main Street Lending Program and as well as the rules allowing for certain
types of some of these restructurings that can be done in the sight of this overall pandemic. That's going to push
out recognition of loss at least, I think, a couple of quarters.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2020
Okay. That will make sense. I'm not saying reversal, I'm just saying it doesn't show up again in Q2. I guess, the
other question is on margin, it appears like you're set up reasonably well from a margin perspective. I appreciate
all the disclosure but give us an idea of some of the near term, longer term puts and takes, how are you thinking
about the margin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief
Financial Officer, Western
Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. So, we have a lot of clients that are at their floors, we talked about that. I would say competitively at this
point in time, spreads have widened out as rates came down, as uncertainty rose. If that settles in, you could see
that maybe some of the spreads would actually come down over time, which could put pressure on earning asset
yields on a more longer term basis. I think that assumes that things are getting better economically. Well, if things
are getting better economically, maybe the Fed is then inclined to look at where we are on the zero band and start
putting that back up. So, it could be a scenario that you actually don't see rates coming down in terms of loans
generally because at the same time spreads are declining maybe overall base rates start to rise because people
are comfortable in terms of kind of the recovery of the economy.
So – but those are two dynamics that I really don't know how to gauge. But we are at the zero bound here. I don't
see – obviously, I don't think things are going to get lower, the Fed has come out and said that they're against
negative rates, I think that would certainly be a mistake to go there. So, I mean you maybe have this kind of
overall lighter compression over time but as of right now, that's certainly not the case. As Ken indicated on the
residential side in particular, we actually have seen rates rise, and in fact spreads in residential loans have
increased in some cases and really haven't participated in terms of the rate cuts that have taken place.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Good. And then, Ken, maybe one more for you, you talked earlier about $1.5 billion in organic loan growth
and maybe a third of it was drawdowns is I think what you said. Could you talk a little bit about the quality of that
growth, how you think about that is – it seems like still a big number for a lot of uncertainty in the economy. So,
maybe just bigger picture broader talk about the quality of the growth and maybe some of the drivers of that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth A. Vecchione A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. So, the loan growth was $2 billion, the credit drawdowns brought it down to what would have been $1.5
billion. That was our estimate somewhere early into the quarter when we started to see some opportunities filled.
Now, where that growth came from? Capital call lines, industry has never had a loss, came from warehouse
lending, we've had that business 11 plus years, we've never had a loss. It came in resort financing, not only had
we never had a loss but the team has been running that business for 35 years, has never had a loss. So, if you
can forget about the pandemic for a second and go back to our approach in 2019, we started talking about de-
risking the balance sheet.
CLD was coming down, which it has, and you saw the uptake in our residential book of business and our
warehouse funding and our capital call lines and resort financing. So, those businesses are zero or very low risk
loss businesses and I would expect the volume for Q2 to match what we did in Q1 on organic basis but I would
expect the growth to come in those business segments that I just mentioned.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Tyler Stafford Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hey, good morning, guys. Maybe just to start on that last question there or last comment, can you just talk about
the balance sheet growth expectations this year? Obviously, a strong start here in the first quarter. You mentioned
some of the draw downs on the lines, but just how should we think about both loan and deposit growth for the
remainder of the year relative to that prior kind of $600,000 million to $800,000 range. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
I'm not going to put a number out there. There are just so many moving factors. I have a little more visibility
around Q2. And I think I would plan absent the PPP loan portfolio. I think I would plan on the lower end of that
range, $500 million to $600 million on deposits, $500 million to $600 million on loans, and if we surprise to the
upside, then great. We put in on the deposit side a number of different programs that we thought – we hope that
could be successful and/or maybe take some market share from our peer group. We'll see if we could make that
happen for the rest of the year. But I think towards the lower end of that range would be the right thing to do. And
don't forget when we spike in Q2 and have some of that spike hold on in Q3 because of the PPP loans, they're
going to just fall way towards the back half of the year.

Tyler Stafford Q

Hi. Thanks. A follow-up on the hotel book, you mentioned that loan modifications are going through at the end of
the year. Hypothetically, if hotels remain empty until a vaccine is developed which could be 12 to 18 months from
now, at one point and under what scenario would you move to foreclose on the hotel properties?

Kenneth A. Vecchione A

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 17-Apr-2020
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
So – yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
What we're looking for is, we're looking for solutions that combine capital contribution from the borrower with our
ability to give them a deferral or some relief and a modification. That takes this beyond three months, beyond six
months, which we see a lot of the other competitors doing. It seems like they're just handing out kind of three
months deferrals and say, well, let's address this again in June or July. We're not doing that. We're trying to
bridge to a longer time line.
In terms of what does this look like, so I mean these borrowers, they have obligations, we're going to be able to
give them some relief on this type of thing, but – and a lot of them have considerable resources to draw upon. So,
is there a situation whereby some of them become very stressed and we see migration down to special mention
down to substandard? I think that's certainly the case. What it's going to take for us to foreclose on one of these.
Well, we have a value, we have our shareholders that we need to respond to and we're going to be accountable
to that and we're going to be responding to that. That's why we think the loan-to-value is so important here
because if somebody isn't – if somebody doesn't want to be able to continue here or has to throw in the keys,
then it's like, okay, well as long as hotels overall haven't fallen more than 40% of original value, we probably have
very nominal risk of loss because of where we are in the strong LTV.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
That's helpful. Thanks for that. And then shifting gears, you mentioned about how the Main Street Lending
Program should benefit some of your larger customers. I was wondering will you be able to swap out your existing
loans for the new loan under the facility and essentially transfer the risk to the government.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
No, no, the program doesn't allow for that, in terms of – when you issue of Main Street Lending Program, it has to
be a new disbursement, it can't pay off something that's already outstanding.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. And do you believe the program is big enough to make a difference? Because looking at the SBA PPP
program that those funds were exhausted fairly quickly.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Well, I mean they were exhausted fairly quickly, and I guess it remains to be seen whether they're going to
reauthorize that for another $250 million. I'm not sure that the process for the Main Street Lending Program is
going to be as complicated a pathway as it is for the Federal Reserve. You don't have to have two different parties
from different – opposite ends of this political spectrum to be able to unite on something and agree, you have to
get the FOMC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to agree on this. So, I don't know, I mean I
think it remains to be seen what the demand is, they put it out there at $600 million, that seems like that's got

some room to go. It obviously goes to much larger enterprises, $2.5 billion of revenue, 10,000 employees. So,
we'll see about kind of what that looks like.
But I haven't heard anything about that but I think they want to get it going and maybe see what the demand is
before they go on from there. But again we expect to be early, we were early with PPP. We got $1.5 billion. If you
look at the portion of what we did in PPP relative to our size to the overall banking community in the country, we
had a much higher penetration than most institutions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
And then the last one for me is in the slide deck it was mentioned about 82% of the variable rate loans with floors
are at those floors. Can you remind us what's the average life or average stated maturity of those loans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Well, the average stated maturity for our loan book is just under four years and it's going to track pretty closely
with that.

Operator: The next question today comes from Gary Tenner of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Hey, thanks, guys. Good morning. I just wanted to ask a couple of question on the PPP. Dale, I think you
mentioned that as those get funded they'll be in the balance sheet for up to six months. I thought the timeline for
when the bank or borrower could, I guess, supply to have the loan forgive was about seven weeks. Is that – is
there something different than my understanding there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Well, let me clarify it a little bit. So, you obtain a PPP loan and the portion of that, that is forgivable i.e. that's used
to cover employee compensation, certain elements of rents and other basic expenses, that's the part that that can
be forgiven by the SBA. And so, that isn't going to be a shorter timeline. The actual PPP loans themselves are two
years. So, what we see is we see what was the usage – somebody gets a loan for X amount, what is the usage of
that? About two-thirds of the amount used for these loans has been for something that should be ultimately
forgivable because those funds are going to be used to support those particular items that are identified in the
legislation. The back third something that isn't forgivable, and so that's going to be more of a term structure for
two years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Thanks. And the fees on that, you'll be accounting for them through spread income or is that [indiscernible]
(01:13:57)?

Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
It will go through spread income and it'll be frontend loaded because of the kind of the odd nature of how these
loans are going to amortize with the payment forgiveness and then the borrower responsible for the rest.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Right. So, it would artificially inflate the margin, say, in the second quarter and then have a lesser impact as they
get paid off beyond that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah, second and third.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Yeah. So, then – and then just a follow-up in terms of the pay-downs, I think, Ken, you mentioned some pay-
downs from those – of the loans that were drawn in March, you've seen some of the repayments. So, could you
maybe quantify what you've seen in terms of the repayments on some of those loans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
It's been modest. What I meant to say is we're not seeing additional draws of any significance and there's been
some modest payments. It seems to have been stabilized and that echoes what I'm hearing from these other
institutions. I think BofA made a particular comment about this. But if you look at where these corporate finance
loans – who the syndicator is, it's JPMorgan, it's BofA, it's Wells Fargo, it's the larger institutions and I think what
we're seeing really mirrors with what they're talking about.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Hey, thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a follow-up, Ken, on your comments about net charge-offs and
when they'd be realized. I guess, maybe in particular, could you just talk about high level where you think those
will come from at this point? It sounds like maybe you don't expect as much from hotel, given the collateral base
there, but would it be more tech and life sciences businesses, with less collateral base or some of the C&I
categories in particular, Shared National Credits or anything like that that maybe we're not seeing or focusing on
right now?

So, I think I took a little bit of a step out there, saying I just think charge-offs will be a little bit later. My crystal ball
isn't as clear to say which group is it – are going to have the charge-offs. And I don't feel comfortable really putting
that out there at this time. I just don't – as the things are changing so quickly that I would clearly be wrong. And I
just rather hold back my intuitive feel on that. But I do feel generally that charge-offs will come later in the year
and not as early as people think.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Okay. And then maybe Dale just on the Shared National Credit book, I think that was a strategy that you guys had
in the past on a small basis maybe it gotten up to about $1 billion maybe in outstanding at one point. Can you just
tell us the balance at this point, and anything that we should be looking at there in terms of mitigating factors?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
Yeah. I mean, we're probably at about $1.4 billion, I mean most of the draws that have come down have come
down in SNCs. And as we've talked about in the past, this is a kind of low investment grade portfolio. The
syndicators are, as I just mentioned, the large banking companies that we participated in. At times, we've tried to
do so, so that we can augment our ability to push forward deposits from some of these enterprises that are in our
markets. And so we've taken a little piece of them.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Okay. And then maybe just last one for me. Just on the expenses, obviously, pretty decent step down this quarter,
really I assume lower comp expectations, but is that kind of a new run rate that we should kind of base growth off
of from here, or any other factors that may be shifted meaningfully with kind of everyone working from home et
cetera?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Dale M. Gibbons A
Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Western Alliance Bancorporation
I think we're on a lower trajectory from where we were with this shutdown. We're continuing to do the necessary
investments that we have in technology to make sure our platform continues to support what we're doing today,
which is basically executing on our business resumption continuity programs.
