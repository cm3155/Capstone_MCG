Stephen J. Squeri
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Thanks, Rosie. Good morning.
I'm pleased to report that our 2019 fourth quarter and full-year results continued the steady consistent
performance that we've delivered over the past two years. Our strong top line growth continued, with revenues
growing 9% in the quarter. This marked our 10th straight quarter of FX-adjusted revenue growth at or above 8%.
Once again, our revenue growth was broad-based, driven by well-balanced mix of fees, spend, and lend. We
added 11.5 million new proprietary cards in 2019, delivered solid billings growth, and continued to grow loans
while maintaining industry-leading credit metrics.
These results show that our strategy of investing in share, scale, and relevance is working. This strategy is at the
heart of our financial model, and it gives us confidence that in today's economic environment, we can sustain
high-levels of revenue growth, which is the foundation for steady double-digit earnings growth.

My confidence in our ability to generate consistent solid results over the longer term is based on several factors:
the fundamental strength we derive from our differentiated business model; the significant growth opportunities
we see across our business; and our demonstrated success in executing our investment strategy against the four
strategic imperatives I laid out two years ago.
Let me take a few minutes to share some of the highlights of the progress we made on each of these strategic
imperatives in 2019. We expanded our leadership in the premium consumer space by continuing our disciplined
strategic approach of refreshing our premium charge products and upgrading our co-brand portfolios globally. In
all these cases, we've added features that our Card Members value. Acquisitions remained strong, and
approximately 70% of our new Card Members are choosing fee-based products, which helped to drive 17%
growth in subscription-like fee revenues for the year.
Our new Card Members are skewing younger and are more digitally engaged. Our refreshed products are also
enabling us to reengage with our existing customer base, where we are seeing increased organic spend, all-time
high Net Promoter Scores, and steady retention.
In our commercial business, we've taken our successful approach to strategic product refreshes and applied it to
our business card portfolio in the US and select markets around the world. In addition to the refreshes, we've
expanded our commercial card offerings with the introduction of several new products for business customers of
all sizes.
And to deepen our relationships with our business customers, we continued our focus on growing our non-card
product offerings by expanding our AP automation solutions, as well as offering a variety of lending and flexible
payment programs to help our business customers manage cash flow and grow their businesses. In total, over
the past two years, we've refreshed and launched over 50 proprietary products across both our commercial and
consumer businesses around the world, resulting in greater customer engagement and strong new card
acquisitions, which are driving our revenue growth.
Turning to the network business, in 2016 we set an ambitious goal of achieving virtual parity coverage in the
United States by the end of 2019. Setting this goal was a recognition of the fundamental importance that our
merchant network plays in driving growth across our businesses, and it galvanized our organization's focus on
achieving it. I'm very pleased to report that as of year-end 2019, based on our internal tracking and our
understanding of the latest industry data, we have achieved virtual parity coverage, with approximately 99% of
credit card accepting merchants in the US now able to accept the American Express card.
Of course, we recognize that virtual parity coverage will always be a moving target. The merchant landscape is
dynamic, with hundreds of thousands of US businesses opening and closing every year. Therefore, we will
continue to focus on maintaining virtual parity coverage in the US in 2020 and beyond.
We're also making good progress to increase coverage across our international markets where our Card
Members live, work, and travel to the most, and this will continue to be a focus for us. Going forward, as we
continue to grow our network, we'll work with our merchant partners in the US and around the world to ensure that
our Card Members are warmly welcomed and encouraged to spend in the millions of places where their Amex
cards are accepted.
Finally, I'm also pleased to report that the People's Bank of China officially accepted our network application, an
important next step in our plan to build a network business in China.

On the digital front, we've been hard at work integrating the acquisitions we've made over the last few years into
our mobile app to provide our Card Members with premium access and experiences across a wide range of
travel, dining, and lifestyle services that differentiate us from our competitors. We're also working with our partners
and our internal development teams to deliver a wide range of new online and mobile features, capabilities, and
services, to help our customers manage their life and their business efficiently and securely.
Our goal in these initiatives is to deepen the digital ties we have with our customers so that American Express
becomes an indispensable part of their lives. And we're seeing good results, as customer engagement with our
digital channels are strong and growing. Today, 81% of our active Card Members are digitally engaged with us via
our app and our website, and we've seen a 26% increase year over year in the customers who use our mobile
app daily.
Those are just some of the highlights of our accomplishments in 2019. As I've reported each quarter for the past
two years, the progress we've made in each of these areas is driving our performance and shows that our
financial model and investment strategy has generated sustainable growth. That's why we'll continue this strategic
approach and why we're confident that we have a long runway for steady growth over the long term. With that in
mind, we expect to deliver revenue growth in 2020 of 8% to 10% on an FX-adjusted basis and earnings of $8.85
to $9.25.
Looking ahead, our business is strong and our focus is clear. We have an incredibly talented team at all levels
and strong relationships with a wide array of outstanding business partners, from our co-brand and digital
partners to our millions of merchant partners around the globe, all working together to deliver the best products
and services for our customers. I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in 2020 and beyond, and I'm
confident in our ability to continue to deliver sustainable growth for our shareholders.
Now, let me turn it over to Jeff.

Jeffrey C. Campbell
Executive Vice President-Finance, Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here today to talk about the fourth quarter and
what was a solid year for American Express and to lay out our expectations for 2020.
I'll discuss both our quarterly and full year results this morning since it is our year-end call, and since looking at
our performance on an annual basis is both more in line with how we actually manage the business and also
gives us a better sense of the underlying trends.
Turning to our summary financials on slide 3, fourth quarter revenues of $11.4 billion, grew 9% on an FX-adjusted
basis and full year revenues of $43.6 billion also grew 9% on an FX-adjusted basis. This growth as it has been all
year continues to be driven by a well-balanced mix of growth in fee, spend and lend revenues and was consistent
with the high levels of revenue growth we've delivered for over two years. This strong top line performance drove
net income of $6.8 billion for the full year and $1.7 billion for the fourth quarter.
In understanding our year-over-year results, I do need to spend a minute on some discrete impacts in our
reported results this year and last year. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of 2018 contained $0.58 of positive
adjustments for discrete tax items related to the Tax Act of 2017 and certain tax audits. In addition, as you
remember, in the first quarter of this year, we had a $0.21 charge from the resolution of certain merchant
litigation. If you adjust for these two impacts as we have done on slide 3, full year 2019 adjusted EPS was $8.20,

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2020
up $0.12 versus the prior-year adjusted EPS of $7.33, including the $2.03 of EPS in the fourth quarter, which was
up 17% versus the prior-year.
Turning now to the details of our performance, I'll start with billed business which you see several views of on
slides 4 through 6. Starting on slide 4, total FX-adjusted billed business growth was up 6% in the fourth quarter
and for the full year. We do think it is important to continue to break out the billings growth between our
proprietary and network businesses due to the differing trends as we continue to see the impact of exiting our
network business in Europe and Australia due to regulatory changes.
The 13% of our overall billings that comes from our network business, GNS, was down 1% in the fourth quarter
and down 2% for the full year on an FX-adjusted basis, as a result of the market exits. We do expect to fully lap
the billings impact from these exits in the latter part of 2020 and return to positive levels of growth. Our proprietary
business, which makes up 87% of total billings and drives most of our financial results, was up 7% in the fourth
quarter and 8% for the full year on an FX-adjusted basis.
Turning to slide 5, as we have said throughout 2019, the proprietary billed business growth trends are consistent
with the economic environment. Solid growth, but slower than the very robust growth we saw in 2018. You see
this as you turn to slide 6 to look at the billings by customer type for the fourth quarter.
Starting with US consumer, which made up 33% of the company's billings in the fourth quarter and remains our
largest customer segment. Billings were up 7%, in line from the 7% to 8% growth we have seen all year. This
growth reflects continued strong acquisition performance and solid underlying spend growth from existing
customers. These trends also highlight the relative strength of the consumer in the US Moving to the right,
international consumer growth remained in the double-digits at 11% on an FX-adjusted basis, despite the mix
macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. In the fourth quarter, we saw growth moderate in Mexico and the
UK sequentially, driven by external factors. So growth in the UK remain in the mid-teens and we continued to see
strong growth in the mid-teens in our top markets across the European Union, as well as in Japan.
Spending from our US small and midsized enterprise Card Members, or SMEs, grew a solid 6% in the fourth
quarter, in line with the third quarter. We continue to feel good about the steady acquisition results we're seeing in
our US SME customers, and importantly, as we think about 2020, we saw stabilization in this key customer
segment in Q4. International SME remains our highest-growing customer type, with 15% FX-adjusted billings
growth in the fourth quarter. We feel great about the strong growth we saw throughout 2019 coming off of even
higher levels of growth in 2018. Given our focus on this segment, and the low penetration we have in the top
countries where we offer international small business products, we continue to believe we have a long runway to
sustain strong growth going forward.
And then for the relatively small part of our volumes 9% this quarter that come from large and global corporate
card billings, we saw a decline of 1% on the fourth quarter on an FX-adjusted basis, similar to what we saw last
quarter. As we've said for years, now this is not a growth segment for us, but it is an important part of our
merchant value development.
Finally on the far right, Global Network Services was down 1% on an FX-adjusted basis, driven by the market
exits, that I mentioned earlier. And if you were to adjust for those impacts, the remaining portion of GNS was up
3% on an FX-adjusted basis in line with Q3. Overall, we continue to feel good about the breadth of our billings
growth and the opportunities we see across the range of geographies and customer segments in which we
operate.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2020
Turning now to loan performance on slide 7, total loan growth was 8% in the fourth quarter with about 60% of our
growth for the year coming from our existing customers. We continue to focus on taking advantage of the unique
opportunity we have to deepen our share of our existing customer's borrowing.
At the same time, as we've been saying all year, we have increased our investments in premium products and
that shift in portfolio mix, coupled with some steady tightening we have done on the risk management side over
the past several years has led to lower loan growth. The shift towards more premium products has also led to
lower loan balances on promotional offers, which along with continued positive impacts from pricing for risk,
contributed to the 50 basis point year-over-year increase in net interest yield in the fourth quarter if you see on the
right-hand side of slide 7.
So the combination of loan growth and yield increase has drove the 12% growth in net interest income that we
delivered this quarter. Ultimately, we are focused on driving profitable revenue growth as the financial outcome of
our lending strategy. And so, we are pleased with the stability in net interest income growth that we saw in 2019.
Turning next to the credit metrics on slide 8. If you were to take an average for the year to smooth out the
quarterly volatility, lending write-off rates were up 22 basis points and charge rates were up 14 basis points on
average for the full year. This level of modest write-off rate increases in a BAU environment is consistent with the
expectations we have talked about for several years now. And as you can see on the bottom of the slide,
delinquency rates have been relatively stable all year and the GCP loss ratio continued to actually be down year-
over-year.
These trends reflect both the credit implications of our strategy as well as the relatively stable economy and low
unemployment rate. We continue to expect modest increases in our loss rates in 2020, consistent with the trends
we've now seen for several years. Importantly, we still do not see anything in our portfolios that would suggest a
significant change in the credit environment both on the consumer and commercial side. In fact, all of these
portfolios performed much better in 2019 than we expected at the beginning of the year.
This brings us to provision expense which grew 7% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. The business
decisions we've made to shift more towards premium products along with tightening things a bit on the risk
management side both contributed to the loan growth, credit metrics and provision trends we saw in 2019. Moving
forward, while there may be some variability in the monthly trends, we expect relatively steady loan growth in
2020. And as I mentioned a few moments ago from a credit perspective, we expect the kind of modest increases
in loss rates year-over-year that we've been seeing to continue. As a result of these dynamics, we do expect
higher provision expense growth in 2020 than we saw in 2019.
While we're on the subject of provision, yes, let me touch on CECL. As you know, the CECL accounting changes
went into effect on January 1, 2020, for us as well as the rest of the industry. In our first quarter results, we'll
report the implementation or Day 1 impact, which we estimate will increase credit reserves by about $1.2 billion.
The increase will run net of tax through equity, with no impact to earnings. I would remind you that a unique
aspect of American Express is our charge card portfolio. So although our card and other lending reserves will go
up by approximately $1.7 billion, we will have an offset from the approximately $0.5 billion decrease in charge
reserves given the short life of those receivables.
Now, as a reminder, this increase will not have a material impact on our capital ratios or our ability to return
capital to shareholders given our 30%-plus return on equity in the multiyear phase-in-period for regulatory capital
purposes.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2020
Then we get to the ongoing or as some would say the Day 2 impact of accounting for CECL and our ongoing
provision expense, starting in the first quarter of 2020. Under our current outlook, we expect a relatively modest
increase to our annual 2020 provision expense from the implementation of CECL. More significantly, I do expect
that there will be more quarter-to-quarter volatility under CECL compared to the previous methodology, though
some of this volatility should net out over the course of the year, making our longstanding focus on annual results
rather than quarterly results even more pronounced in 2020.
Now let's get back to our results and turn to revenues on slide 10. FX-adjusted revenue growth was 9% in the
fourth quarter and for the full year. The focused execution of our strategy has delivered strong top line revenue
growth of 8% or more for the last 10 quarters on an FX-adjusted basis. This consistent revenue performance has
occurred in both the robust economic environment of 2018 and the somewhat slower growth environment of 2019
and continues to be supported by a well-balanced mix of growth in fee, spend, and lend revenues, as you see on
slide 11.
Net card fees remained the fastest growing revenue line, up 17% for the full year and accelerating to 20% in the
fourth quarter. We are really pleased by the confidence that our customers place in our value propositions when
they choose to pay these subscription-like fees. And we continue to see that the majority of our new Card
Members, around 70%, are choosing our fee-based products as well.
Supported by the continued execution of our product refreshment strategy and our focus on premium value
propositions, we expect card fee revenues will remain the fastest growing revenue line in 2020. We are confident
in our ability to maintain strong card fee growth given the breadth of products that are driving this momentum
across geographies and customer segments, as well as the high levels of engagement we see with new and
existing Card Members.
These high levels of engagement, supported by the progress we've made around coverage, continue to drive
steady growth in our largest and most important revenue line, discount revenue, which was up 6% for the full year
and in the fourth quarter, broadly in line with billings. And net interest income grew at 12% for the full year and in
the fourth quarter, driven by the growth in loans and net yield that I mentioned a few moments ago.
Looking ahead, I expect net interest income growth to continue to be a bit higher than loan growth, driven by
continued benefits from pricing and mix as well as a modest tailwind from 2019 rate cuts. Importantly, the portion
of our revenue coming from fee and spend revenues remained at 80% for the full year and the fourth quarter, in
line with history, and we expect that revenue composition to continue given our differentiated spend and fee-
centric model.
Moving on to expenses on slide 13, overall expenses grew 9% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. There are
three important items impacting the quarter here that more or less offset, but are important to understand. First,
there were a few positive income tax and other tax-related developments in the quarter that show up in the low
effective tax rate as well as in the operating expense line.
We then, as we often do, took the opportunity to reinvest the upside we saw relative to our original plans to do two
important things for the long-term health of the business. First, we accelerated the funding of some incremental
business growth initiatives, similar to what we did in last year's fourth quarter. And second, we accelerated some
of the things we were doing to evolve our organization for the future and improve operating efficiencies. And as a
result, we took a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter, which is included in the salary and benefits line in the
tables that accompany our earnings release. As I mentioned before, the impact of these three items roughly offset

one another. And you see the impacts across OpEx, marketing and business development, and the lower
effective tax rate at the bottom of the page.
Looking at the full year, our OpEx growth of 8% was also impacted by the litigation-related charge we took in the
first quarter of 2019 that I mentioned earlier in my remarks. And as I've said previously, some of the investments
we are making to deliver continued strong revenue growth, growth in sales force, growth in premium servicing,
and enhancements in digital capabilities, caused us in 2019 to see more growth in operating expenses than we
have seen in recent years, or importantly, than we expect to see going forward. We have a long track record of
generating operating expense leverage by growing OpEx more slowly than revenues. And going forward, we are
confident that we have a long runway to continue to do so.
Turning now to slide 14 to look at the trend in customer engagement expenses, overall customer engagement
expenses for the full year grew 10% as a result of our investment strategy. Starting at the bottom, marketing and
business development costs were up 10% for the full year due to our continued focus on funding growth initiatives
and in part the incremental impact of the 11-year extension of our longstanding partnership with Delta that we
signed earlier this year.
Moving on to rewards expense, you can see that it grew 8% and was broadly in line with proprietary billed
business growth for the full year. And as we continue to evolve our value propositions and see high engagement
with our premium benefits, Card Member services grew 25% for the full year. While there were some adjustments
that caused slower growth in Card Member services in the fourth quarter, we continue to expect this line to be our
fastest growing expense category, as it includes the cost of many components of our differentiated value
propositions, such as airport lounge access and other travel benefits, which we believe are difficult for others to
replicate and help support the strong acquisition and engagement we are seeing on our fee-based products.
Going forward, we continue to expect total customer engagement expenses to grow a bit faster than revenues as
we continue to invest in share, scale, and relevance.
Turning to capital on slide 15, we ended the year with a CET1 ratio of 10.7%, which is near the top of our 10% to
11% target range. During the year, we increased our dividend by 10% and returned $6 billion of capital to our
shareholders. This outcome is a testament to the 30%-plus return on equity that our financial model generates, as
well as our focus on maintaining capital strength while consistently returning excess capital to our shareholders.
As we've said, our primary focus is on maintaining our CET1 ratio within our 10% to 11% target range as the
governor of our capital distribution plans, and we do not believe that CECL will have a material impact on those
plans.
To sum up, we feel really good about our steady and consistent performance throughout 2019. Looking ahead,
we see a long runway to sustain high levels of revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth in today's economic
environment. That brings me to our outlook for 2020, and then we'll open the call for your questions.
Our guidance for 2020 is consistent with our financial growth algorithm. As Steve mentioned at the start of our
call, we are introducing our 2020 earnings per share guidance at a range of $8.85 to $9.25. Our guidance does
assume an economy that looks somewhat similar to 2019 and reflects what we know today about the regulatory
and competitive environment. Consistent with the performance, we've been delivering for over two-years, this
guidance includes revenue growth of 8% to 10% on an FX-adjusted basis. And at current exchange rates, we'd
expect a more modest headwind from FX in our reported growth than we saw in 2019. And as I mentioned earlier,
we will continue to invest to drive those high-levels of revenue growth and so we expect customer engagement
expenses to grow a bit faster than revenues again in 2020.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2020
And we are committed to generating operating expense leverage by growing our 2020 OpEx at a slower pace
than revenues and slower than the pace we saw in 2019. Looking at the drivers of our financial results, there were
a few other key planning assumptions I'd highlight. As I mentioned earlier, we expect the provision growth to be
higher in 2020 than it was in 2019, including a relatively modest increase from CECL. We do expect CECL to
drive more volatility quarter-to-quarter, and so focusing on the full-year results will be even more critical in 2020.
In addition, we expect that our effective tax rate will be around 21% next year.
In summary, we remained focused on sustaining high levels of revenue growth and in today's environment,
double-digit EPS growth. As I look at our performance over the past two years, and our expectations for 2020,
they clearly demonstrate consistent execution against our strategy, as well as our financial growth algorithm.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Rosie.

Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Good to see the solid guide for 2020. Jeff want to confirm, does the EPS guidance include the negative impact of
CECL?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Executive Vice President-Finance, Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Yes. Absolutely. So when you think about the range we've provided this year, Don, I would say the normal thing of
– you have to think about a little stronger economy pushes us towards the higher-end, a little weaker economy
which is why a lower-end range is there and CECL is the other uncertainty. But absolutely we are contemplating
what I call the relatively modest impact of CECL in there, so you should go with that as full GAAP guidance.

Donald Fandetti Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And are you – in your guidance, I mean, I assume we're sort of at the trough of billed business here as you're
lapping some tougher comps. Do you have an acceleration built in? And could you talk about the discount rate

I think what I would actually point you to is the remarks, Steve started with, we've had 10 straight quarters now,
Don, of revenue growth which is ultimately what we're focused on in the 8% to 10% range and the fourth quarter
was another strong quarter of revenue growth. So actually, when we look at that metric, which ultimately is the
end goal of the mixture of everything we're doing with card fees, with pricing, loan growth, billings, with the
discount rate, we actually see a lot of stability in the momentum that we're entering in terms of revenue growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. I think the other point is that if you look over these 10 quarters, we've shown that there is an elasticity to our
billed business that still continues to drive the high revenue growth. And so, given the high card fees – the higher
growth in card fees, the consistent performance we've had from a net interest income perspective, billings can
fluctuate up and down. The other thing I would point out is not all billings are created equally. So we feel really
comfortable with where we wound-up and how we enter the year from a billings perspective.

Operator: Next question is from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark C. DeVries Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.
Yeah, thanks. Steve, I have a question for you just on what inning you guys are in in this kind of product-launch
and refresh cycle? I'm assuming given you've done 50 already that it's pretty late innings. And the reason I'm
asking is as you pointed out it's been a big contributor to adding new customers, re-engaging with existing ones
and presumably been really helpful in generating that strong revenue growth. And if we are in kind of later innings,
what are you looking to as kind of the levers to continue to sustain that revenue growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. The interesting thing is I wouldn't equate this to innings. I would equate this to baseball seasons, because
the way you've got to think about this is that product refreshes can happen on a three-to-four-year basis. And so
we get to play season all over again. And so, you look at 50 refreshes over the last two years, there are still more
to do within the existing portfolio, and by the time you get done, guess what, some of your products are three and
four years old now. So I wouldn't think about this as a onetime thing. And I think you have to think about this as
continuous refreshment. Because look, the reality is our customer base constantly changes. We're looking to
appeal to new customers at all aspects. If you look at Platinum, before we did the refresh, Platinum was not as
attractive to millennials as it is today. And if you look at the value and the benefits that we put on it, it's become a
much more attractive product and most of our growth has come from millennial uptake.
Look we have – since the refresh we have 60% more Platinum Cards than we did prior to that refresh, and over
50% of the new cards acquired to millennials. So I wouldn't think about this as an innings game. I think about this
as we constantly play the baseball season and there's going to be another season and another season and
another season. It's just going to be different – it's going to be different card products. And when you look at our
portfolio of card products, it's in the hundreds, so we have a ways to go.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2020
Hi. I was hoping that you could talk a little bit about the network opportunities outside the US. I know you
mentioned, Steve, that you've essentially achieved parity in the US now and maybe if you could give us a sense,
because I know that was a three-year outlook that you gave, I think last year. And where are we there and should
we expect acceleration? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. So look, from an outside of the US perspective, obviously, we're nowhere near where we are in the US. We
identified a strategy that we wanted to increase overall coverage internationally by 20% over a three-year period.
We talked about that at Investor Day. I say without giving specific metrics on this, we've made progress. We
expect to hit that 20% growth target over that three-year period. It's a very focused strategy in that we're looking
at key cities. We're looking at the key cities that our Card Members travel to and that we have large card bases in.
And we're also working with our network partners in markets that we do not have proprietary businesses to
continue to grow that.
And let's not forget our efforts in China. Our license has been accepted. We're waiting for the final approval, and
hopefully, sometime this year, we will launch the network and that will increase not only coverage in China, but
what it'll do is, it'll put more cards on the network as we engage with the Chinese banks to have more Chinese
travelers as they go into. And the reality is, they are going to go into a lot of our European and Asian cities, which
is going to put more demand and will actually then help drive more coverage. So we're still committed to it and we
continue to invest in it.
And the other point I would make out is the US is not done. From a US perspective, as I said in my remarks, it is a
moving piece. And so what we need to do is to continue to sign those merchants that come into business. And
what we also need to do is to continue our efforts to have warm acceptance. And from a warm acceptance
perspective, what we mean is decals on the doors, we put up over 1 million decals this year just in the United
States alone and it's an education process as well. It's an education process for the merchants and it's an
education process for our Card Members that in fact the card is accepted.
So what we've laid, what we would call technical acceptance, there's some more work to be done from a warm
acceptance perspective and our Card Members realizing now that the coverage is there. So you'll see a lot of
work in those areas as well.

Good morning. Thank you, Steve, Jeff and Rosie. Appreciate it. Just your competitors have been making some
significant acquisitions, Visa acquiring Plaid, Mastercard several acquisitions, I mean, PayPal buying Honey.
American Express has done some interesting tuck-in acquisitions. But first of all, is there any concern about some
of the acquisitions from a competitive perspective like a Visa, Plaid? And is Amex – it seems like there are so
many opportunities to leverage your brand and your network with all of this innovation in the fintech and software
space. Is there areas that you would like to leverage or invest more into whether it's security or other areas?

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2020
Look, I mean we're not going to get into obviously specific acquisitions. But what you've seen our focus over the
last sort of 24 months has really been from some of our digital capabilities whether that be Mezi or Resy or Cake
and obviously LoungeBuddy and we did acompay. And so what we're trying to do is build-out the organic footprint
that we have with our existing Card Members, we're trying to engage with them more digitally.
And look I think that our competitors, Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, PayPal is really a partner more than a competitor,
when you look at what they're doing, they're doing things that are smart for them. They're run by really smart
people, and they've got their strategies and their main focus is connectivity and bringing more and more and
different types of transactions across those rails. And I think that the acquisitions that they've done to build-out
from a network perspective are smart acquisitions for them.
When we look at what we're trying to do from a Card Member to merchant perspective, we feel really comfortable
with what we've done. And I think just looking at the Plaid acquisition, which I think is a good acquisition by Visa, it
allows them to provide connectivity from their bank partners into fintechs. In fact, we use Plaid today. We have an
investment in Plaid, and we'll make a little bit on that as well. And so that's a more sensible acquisition for them
than it would be for us, not only from an economic perspective, but certainly from a strategic perspective and I
think just a customer perspective. So we look at everything. We have our own target list of things that we want to
do and things that quite honestly just don't make sense for us, where we're positioned with our model.

Moshe A. Orenbuch Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Great. Thanks and you guys highlighted being with between that 8% and 10% revenue growth kind of for a long
string of quarters and pretty much right in the middle of that over the course of 2019. As you look into 2020, you
talked a little bit maybe of a little bit of a slowdown on net interest income. Are there any other things that you'd be
looking at to accelerate from where they were here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Executive Vice President-Finance, Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, Moshe, yes, we look at the stability we've seen overall in revenue growth, 10 quarters at 8% to 10%, and
see tremendous momentum to continue to meet that same target in 2020.
When you look at acceleration, I would actually point you to card fee growth. So card fee growth has been our
fastest growing revenue line, it actually accelerated in Q4. And for all of the reasons Steve described, we're pretty
bullish in our ability to keep that as our fastest growing revenue line. I also point out to everyone that of course
you have a large – because of the way we give you accounting for this, as you would know, Moshe, we have a
large portion of next year's card fees sitting on the balance sheet waiting to be amortized. So we feel really good
about that line.
And net interest income, I would point out, actually has been very steady sequentially, Moshe, because while our
booked loan growth rate has moderated a little bit, part of that is just us being a little bit tighter about things like
promotion offers, and that's why your yield is going up and net interest income growth has actually been pretty
flat. So gosh, we would look at the 2020 revenue guidance and say it's a continuation of what we've been putting
up for about two and a half years. And we feel pretty good about the stability we see in the economy, the stability
we see in our credit performance, and the tremendous strength frankly of the US consumer.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sanjay Sakhrani Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks, good morning. It sounds like the guidance ranges are more related to execution than anything else. But
last year, Jeff, you guys had talked about a scenario where there was macroeconomic weakness. To the extent
that there was any weakness, how should we think about this guidance, especially on the EPS side? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Executive Vice President-Finance, Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, look, I think the results we posted, Sanjay, in 2019 demonstrate that we've got a model that produced
steady results in the really robust economic environment of 2018, and continued to produce those same results in
the more modest growth environment of 2019. So there is clearly a range of economic outcomes around where
we are, where our model is flexible enough or resistant enough to change. I'll go back to the card fee point I just
made to Moshe, where our card fee growth is actually pretty resilient in different economic environments. So we
feel good about our guidance across any reasonable range of economic outcomes that anyone is forecasting right
now. Now if there's a sudden dramatic shift upwards or downwards, that's the kind of thing that it would take to
probably cause us to move off that range.

Jason Kupferberg Q
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thanks, guys. Good morning. So I just wanted to start on the enterprise commercial side. I know it's still only 9%
of billings, but I think last quarter we were expecting maybe a little bit of an uptick. We got instead a little bit of a
downtick there on a constant-currency basis, so I was just wondering. I know last quarter you had a couple of
specific customers that were call-outs as driving some of the softness. Were those continuing to be headwinds in
Q4? Was there more of a malaise in corporate T&E? Do you still think we get back to call it low single digit in
2020?
And then just on a quick side note, can you size that restructuring charge for us in the quarter? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Executive Vice President-Finance, Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
So let me quickly do the facts on the two, and then Steve will probably add a little bit of color. On the large and
global, I guess we look at it and we say sequentially it's about the same as it was last quarter. Yes, you do have
the same two large customers where there are some things unique to those customers going on. But look, we've
said for a long time, this isn't a growth segment for us. These are big companies doing T&E. It's an important part
of the franchise, so we're not frankly particularly overly focused on that rate. We're focused on other parts of
commercial.
On the restructuring charge, the point I would make to everyone is this is just an example of what we've done for
many, many years, which is we had some very good developments on the tax side. We used that to accelerate
some spending around a range of growth initiatives. You see some of that in the marketing line, some of that in
some of the other customer engagement lines. And yes, we did take a restructuring charge. It's a little bit more
than $100 million. Look, we've been growing expenses. We've added over 5,000 colleagues in the last year. We
will continue to grow expenses in 2020. Frankly, we're going to continue net to add colleagues, but we've got to
14

make sure we have the right people in the right place, so that we can continue as we have for many, many years
to scale our company as we grow our volumes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
And sorry, as far as restructuring, I think Jeff hit all that. Look, I think with the large and global, from a company
perspective, not a lot of companies are looking to grow their T&E. So you don't have the organic growth that you
would have, and then you have a couple of companies that pull back or you have a loss here or there, and you
feel that in the numbers. But it is 9% of the overall billings, but from a profit perspective, it's a lot less than that.
This is an important part of our business from a network perspective, and it allows us to utilize our scale and
infrastructure to really support our middle-market business and our small business. And so it plays an important
role. And I think where we are from a perspective of overall billings, we're comfortable with. It would be great if it
would grow, but if it grows it's not going to make that much of a difference from a profitability perspective, which
gets back to my point about not all billings are created equally. Some billings have a lot more profitability than
others.
And so I think you'll probably see this sort of flatness continue as we move into next year, and it's something that
we're doing in our own company as well. I mean we're not looking to grow our T&E expenses. I don't sit around
with my staff and say let's see how we can grow more T&E. I wouldn't mind sitting around with a lot of my
customers' staffs and saying that, but we don't do that. And I think companies are doing that and you're looking at
T&E and looking at some more video conferencing and things like that and reducing some of the travel and you
see that in the numbers.

Richard Shane Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. Look, given the maturity of the business and it's really
impressive to see your US consumer business which is a third of your business growing at the rate that it is. I'm
curious to sort of understand what you think is driving that. Is there an increase in discretionary spending among
your legacy customers or when you cite particularly the growth of millennials in the portfolio, is it a ramp in their
spending?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Rick, the interesting thing about our business is it's probably not mature yet. And I think one of the reasons after
the financial crisis, everybody jumped into this business, especially the banks in a big way, is because this is a
business that just continues to grow. When you look at the consumer business in the United States, it's sort of
8%, 8%, 8%, 8% and you'll see that continuing. And I think when we look at our business and from maturity
perspective, look, it's a mix of new customers. It's a mix of what we would call same-store sales, if you're thinking
about this from a retail perspective, it's a mix of organic spending as well. But we're bringing in new customers to
the franchise. And our brand is playing a lot more with millennials, which is over half of our customers that we're
acquiring at this particular point in time, and the reach that we're getting with some of our co-brand partners is
getting us new customers as well.

So I don't really look at this business as really mature. I look at this business as having – and I'm not just talking
about our business, I'm talking about the card business in general. I think about this as a business that still has a
lot of legs and a lot of growth and you see a lot of the technological changes whether it's sort of tap-and-go and
making it easy to buy online and so forth. I mean just with Contactless you're going to see more and more smaller
dollar transactions coming on to card products whether that be vending machine transactions, which is the next
thing that's going to happen, you're seeing this with transit, obviously now in New York City, you can use tap-and-
go through the New York City Transit System. So we don't really look at this as a mature business at all and we
think there's expansion opportunities for us, not only with new customers, but also with our existing customers, as
we have less than half their share-of-wallet and we have as we said for a long time, we only have about 23% of
their share of lending. So we think there's still a lot of upside in this business.

David Mark Togut Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Thank you. Good morning. International consumer and international SME continue to be your fastest growth
businesses. And in particular you've called out strength in the UK and the European continent. Given the
regulatory changes with payment services directive to in Europe and UK, Visa and Mastercard have both
acquired fast ACH rails, both to address PSD2, consumer ACH payments and also to complement their B2B
payment capability. So my question really is, does fast ACH need to play a role in American Express' future? And
if so where would you have an interest geographically potentially to acquire fast ACH rails?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. So a couple things. Number one, I think from a consumer perspective, we see this sort of fast payments,
we see as really looking to cannibalize some debit, looking to cannibalize some ACH, some check, and things like
that. So from a consumer perspective, we have an open banking test right now from a consumer perspective
ourselves where we're offering some of our non-customers the ability to payout of their bank accounts, so that
could be an opportunity for us, but I don't see that really impacting credit and charge growth.
Look, I think what's interesting for fast payments ACH from a B2B perspective and I said this multiple times on
calls like this and in meetings, they will play a role in B2B payments and it will play a role in procurement spending
as well. The reality is that we believe we can achieve the same things with the network that we have today and
the connectivity that we have as we have the flexibility in pricing. Look, I'm not constrained by interchange. I could
price from a transaction perspective, and one of the advantages we do have in Europe in particular is we're a
three-party system, we're not a four-party system. And so the relationships that we have with Card Members and
merchants with that direct connectivity we believe we can accomplish the same things without acquiring either a
Vocalink or Earthport or something like that. But make no mistake, it will play a role in procurement.
The other thing that I've said on these calls before is from a procurement perspective, fast ACH is really not sort
of the be-all, end-all given that most of these payments occur in 60 to 90 days. The bigger opportunity is really
integrating the payment process within the procurement process and marrying the procure-to-pay. And that takes
a long, long time and that's why you do partnerships with people like SAP and people like Ariba to try and
integrate the payment in. Look, from my perspective, and we're on procurement here as well, companies are
much more focused on how you merge the two than sort of paying their vendor in 20 minutes. The last thing I
want to do is really pay a vendor in 20 minutes. But what I really want to do is integrate the two together. So I
think there's a place for these acquisitions again for Visa and Mastercard, it goes back I think a little bit to the
16

Plaid acquisition. But I think we can accomplish the same thing with the capabilities that we have at the current
moment.

James E. Friedman Q
Analyst, Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So Steve, I did – and in follow-up to the previous question and the previous
before that, I did want to ask about that large and global corporate again. And I know it's a little like playing
twister, but I'm looking at the appendix in terms of the volumes from T&E and the T&E actually grew 6%. So that
seems pretty good and consistent with the way that it's been. But I realize not all T&E lands in large and
corporate, I assume some of that's in – so anyway any context about how the T&E grow, but the large and
corporate was down?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
Yeah. Well, think about our consumer travel business, and think about – just think about the expansion that we've
had in small business international and the expansion that we've had in consumer international. And when you
think about small business international, it's not as mature as small businesses in the United States. And so if you
go back in history, what happened from a small business perspective in the United States that started as a T&E
card and now has morphed much more into a B2B card. And so the mix of volume that we have. And the reality is
when you think about sort of the T&E aspects, as it relates outside the US, small business international that we
have, there's a higher percentage of T&E that occurs on that card because that's the first thing that small
businesses will put on internationally, and then obviously, our consumer business is growing in leaps and bounds
internationally, and again, that has a much more T&E focus than it does retail focus.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Executive Vice President-Finance, Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
The only math point I would add is in our tables, that stat is the US stat but it just goes to the point that the large
and global segment is a small part of our total billings. So the T&E trends get dwarfed in terms of the global
company, by what consumers and small business are doing.

Christopher Donat Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Steve, I want to ask a longer-term history question about your card
fee strategy because when you go back a few years, there really wasn't that much growth or low single-digit
growth in card fees. And I'm wondering if your view is – what's changed more Amex's approach or more the
consumer appetite for fee-based cards.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen J. Squeri A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, American Express Co.
No, it's been our approach that has changed, and which is why if you go back for the last couple of years, we
have started to refresh products. We were not in the business of refreshing products. If you do not refresh a
product, it is really hard to increase the fee. Adding value enables you to increase the fee. If you're not adding
17

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 24-Jan-2020
value, you can't do that. We had a fundamental shift in sort of how we've approached the business over the last
few years. You've seen a lot more focus on coverage. You've seen a lot more focus on a focused international
strategy and you've also seen a major focus on card refreshment. And card refreshment, remember is, it's not just
about fees. It's to get people to spend, which then gets people to revolve that spend. So it really is more about
engagement and the fees come along as you add value.

Craig Maurer Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Yeah, thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to get a little clarity on your thoughts for billed business growth trends
in 2020, with comps getting easier, and we're starting to lap some of the issues in corporate and certainly GNS.
Could we see an inflection point in 2020 where billed business growth starts to reaccelerate? And just a
housekeeping item. Are there going to be any unique quarterly trends in marketing spend this year due to the
2020 Olympics? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey C. Campbell A
Executive Vice President-Finance, Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, American Express Co.
Well, I think the short answer on the second one, Craig, is no. Obviously, the Olympics is an important event from
a lot of perspectives and we have a fabulous franchise in Japan, and its benefiting from the Prime Minister's
incentives that he's providing in the country to encourage more card use, all good stuff for us, but not big enough
for you to see in our global results.
On the inflection point on billed business, I'd really go back, Craig to the theme Steve and I have both talked a lot
about over the last hour, which is our revenue momentum has been very stable for 10 quarters and that's
because of the breadth of sources, it's because of the way we're focused on being thoughtful about things like
card fees, which Steve just touched on or how we're pricing for risk in our lending portfolio. And so we feel good
about the trends on billed business. But more importantly, we're focused on the trends and stability on revenue
that make us very comfortable with the guidance we've provided for another year of 8% to 10% revenue growth.
And it is not counting on a big inflection upwards on billed business, if that happens, great. But that is not a
planning assumption if you will that underlies the guidance we've provided.
