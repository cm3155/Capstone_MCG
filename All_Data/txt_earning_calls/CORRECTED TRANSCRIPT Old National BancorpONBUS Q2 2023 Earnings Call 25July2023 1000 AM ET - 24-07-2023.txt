Good morning. We are pleased to be with you today to share details about our strong second quarter
performance. Simply put, the quarter was business as usual for Old National, with growth in deposits, solid
liquidity and credit quality, disciplined loan growth and well-managed expenses. The strength of our franchise
remains evident in the results outlined on slide 4.

We reported EPS of $0.52 for the quarter. Adjusted EPS was $0.54 per common share with adjusted ROA and
ROATCE of 1.33% and 22%, respectively. Our adjusted efficiency ratio was a low 49%. Tangible book value,
excluding AOCI, also increased 15% year-over-year. Deposit balances were up 4% during the quarter, with
growth in core deposits of 2% as we continue to compete for new banking relationships effectively.
Our total cost of deposits was 115 basis points and we maintained our deposit pricing discipline with a low 23%
total deposit beta cycle to date. Our credit quality remained stable with 6 basis points of non-PCD related charge-
offs. We remain watchful and consistent with other banks that are focused on potential pockets of softness. Like
our deposit portfolio, our loan portfolio is granular and relationship-driven, which should continue to serve us well.
We remain confident in our client selection and underwriting. And as you know, Old National has taken a
proactive approach to managing credit. This approach has served us well in the past, and you see evidence of
that [ph] stance this quarter's work (02:57) to address any credit deterioration aggressively.
On the client side, engagement remained high in the quarter. We expect full relationships with our borrowing
clients. And to the extent that new or existing clients lack that potential, we will manage accordingly. We do,
however, continue to expect disciplined loan portfolio growth in 2023. In other areas, it's more of the same. Our
below peer deposit cost should drive a funding advantage. We expect to see organic growth of our wealth
management client base, and we continue to focus on disciplined expense management while building tangible
book value.
We also continue to invest in top revenue generating talent and expand into dynamic new markets within our
footprint. We recently celebrated the opening of our first Metro Detroit area commercial banking office with a
terrific new team. And we announced two prominent commercial relationship managers have joined our Nashville
wealth management team.
Before I turn things over to Brendon, I also want to take a moment to share that our Old National family continues
to recover and heal from the Louisville tragedy on April 10 that claimed the lives of five of our team members and
impacted so many others. More than three months later, our ONB family continues to do our best to love, care for,
and support one another.
Additionally, in June, our downtown Louisville team began serving clients at a new location in the heart of
downtown Louisville. Once again, I want to thank countless individuals and organizations who have cared for and
supported our family during this challenging time. I also want to acknowledge and thank our team members for
their resiliency and their commitment to supporting one another.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Brendon to cover the quarterly results in more detail.

Thanks, Jim. Turning to our quarter-end balance sheet on slide 5, we continue to effectively navigate the
challenging operating environment, achieving a more efficient balance sheet. We improved our earning asset mix
with cash flows from our investment portfolio, reinvested in loans. While [ph] their (05:08) funding mix improved
through higher deposit balances and lower borrowings. As a result, our loan-to-deposit ratio improved by 100
basis points. While strong earnings bolstered our capital levels and contributed to tangible book value growth
despite facing AOCI headwinds.

On slide 6, we present the trend in total loan growth and portfolio yields. Total loans grew by 2% in line with our
expectations. We sold approximately $300 million of non-relationship C&I loans at par during the quarter, as we
look to manage liquidity while prioritizing lending to our clients with full banking relationships. The investment
portfolio decreased by 2%, mainly due to portfolio cash flows and declines in fair values. Despite rate shifts, the
duration remained steady at 4.4 years and is not expected to extend further. Cash flows from the portfolio are
expected to be $1.2 billion over the next 12 months.
Moving to slide 7, we show our trend in total deposits which increased $1.3 billion or 4% quarter-over-quarter.
Core deposits grew approximately $800 million, including $490 million of normal seasonal public inflows. The
trend in average deposits reflects the continued mix shift away from noninterest-bearing accounts into money
markets and [ph] CDs (06:25).
Market conditions continue to put upward pressure on deposit rates, with interest-bearing deposit costs increasing
57 basis points to 1.66%, resulting in a cycle to-date interest-bearing deposit beta of 33%. Total deposit costs
were relatively low at 1.15%, which equates to a cycle to-date total deposit beta of 23%. While it's challenging to
estimate the terminal beta, we had a strong track record of managing deposit rates and are confident we can
maintain our funding cost advantage throughout the remainder of the rate cycle. Our disciplined approach to
exception pricing has allowed us to successfully defend deposit balances and our targeted promotions have
resulted in above peer deposit growth.
Slide 8 provides our quarter-end income statement. We reported GAAP net income applicable to common shares
of $151 million or $0.52 per share. Reported earnings include $6 million in pre-tax, merger related and other
charges. Excluding these items, our adjusted earnings per share was $0.54. Our profitability continues to be
strong with an adjusted return on average tangible common equity of 22.1% and adjusted return on average
assets of 1.33%.
Moving on to slide 9, we present details of our net interest income and margin. Both metrics surpassed our
expectations as we reported a linked-quarter increase in net interest income and experienced lower than
anticipated margin compression. Our strong performance was bolstered by the quarter point rate hike by the Fed
in May and our better than expected deposit growth. Furthermore, we continue to make progress towards
achieving our targeted neutral rate risk position by the end of the rate cycle, while prudently adding protection
against any sudden reversal in Fed rate policy.
Slide 10 shows trends in adjusted noninterest income, which was $82 million for the quarter. Our primary fee
businesses remained stable, but we did benefit from a $4 million increase in other income that we would not
anticipate in a run rate next quarter. The items driving that increase were company-owned life insurance
revenues, a recovery from a prior charged-off asset, and positive derivative valuations associated with the
transition from LIBOR to SOFR.
Continuing to slide 11, we show the trend in adjusted noninterest expenses. Adjusted expenses were $241 million
and our adjusted efficiency ratio was a low 49.4%. Our expenses were well controlled and consistent with the
previous quarter, excluding a $5 million increase in incentive accruals related to our strong year-to-date
performance. This would equate to a Q3 run rate of $237.5 million.
On slide 12, we present our credit trends which remained stable, reflecting the strong performance of both our
commercial and consumer portfolios. Delinquencies have decreased and net charge-offs have remained steady
at a modest 6 basis points, excluding the 7 basis point impact from PCD loans. The rise in nonperforming loans
4

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2023
primarily stems from the anticipated migration of PCD credits as we maintain an aggressive approach to resolving
these loans.
While charge-offs from this portfolio are expected to remain elevated in the short term, we expect minimal impact
on provision expense. Given that we currently carry a $39 million or approximately 4% reserve against this book.
Our second quarter allowance, including reserve for unfunded commitments stands at $338 million or 104 basis
points of total loans. The modest reserve increase was largely driven by loan growth, partially offset by
adjustments in our economic forecast.
We continue to rely on a 100% weighted Moody's S3 scenario that projects peak unemployment of 7.2% and
negative GDP growth of 3.1%. Barring any significant deterioration beyond these economic assumptions, we
expect provision expense to remain limited to portfolio performance and loan growth.
Shifting to key areas of focus on slide 14, you will see further details on our loan portfolio. Our commercial loan
book, which constitutes approximately 70% of our total loans, is granular and well diversified. Our non-owner
occupied CRE is also well diversified across various asset classes and geographies. Regarding non-owner
occupied office properties, the majority of the portfolio was comprised of suburban or medical offices with a
significant portion of credit tenant leases. Only a negligible percentage, less than 1% of total loans is attributed to
properties located within central business districts that are geographically dispersed across 11 Midwestern cities
in our footprint.
On slide 15, we provide highlights from our recent examination of fixed rate CRE maturities over the next 18
months. Less than 1% of total loans that are non-owner occupied CRE mature within 18 months and carry a note
rate of less than 4%. Our approach to underwriting CRE includes a 300-basis-point margin over the current rates
at the time of origination. While these maturing credits have surpassed the original underwriting [ph] stressed
(11:20) coupon, we have observed improved net operating income from higher rents. This improvement has been
sufficient to uphold debt service ratios in line with our underwriting guidelines, and we believe the refinance risk in
this portfolio to be minimal.
Slide 16 details our Q2 commercial production. The $1.9 billion of production was well balanced across all product
lines and major markets.
As discussed on last quarter's call, we have tightened our pricing standards, enhanced our credit structure, and
reinforced with our [ph] RMs (11:50) the importance of acquiring a full banking relationship for new loan requests.
As a result of these actions and strong Q2 production, our pipeline has decreased to $3.1 billion and is consistent
with low- to mid-single digit loan growth we expect in the back half of the year.
On slide 17, we present further insights into our deposit base. Our average core deposit balance is meaningfully
lower than peers. 81% of our accounts have less than $25,000 on deposit and carry an average balance of just
$4,500. It's important to highlight that we maintain strong, enduring relationships with our deposit customers, 50%
of which have been with the bank for over 15 years. Our top 20 deposit clients represent only 5% of total deposits
and have a weighted average tenure of greater than 30 years. Lastly, our brokered deposits were 3.5% of total
deposits at the end of the quarter, which we expect to be well below peer average.
On slide 18, we provide a comprehensive overview of our capital position at the end of the quarter. We observed
improvements in all regulatory capital ratios and maintained stability in our TCE ratio, despite facing the negative
impact of increasing AOCI. Our above peer return on tangible common equity, coupled with our peer average
dividend payout ratio, should result in us accreting capital at a faster rate than most. Additionally, we anticipate
5


Old National Bancorp
(ONB) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2023
30% of our outstanding AOCI to accrete to capital by the end of 2024. We did not repurchase any shares in the
quarter and do not intend to do so in the near term as we focus on capital growth.
In summary, our strong second quarter performance marked the successful conclusion of the first half of 2023,
with results slightly exceeding our expectations. We have improved the efficiency ratio of our balance sheet
through a better earning asset mix; strong core deposit growth led to a better funding mix; and we grew tangible
book value per share by 15%, excluding [ph] the OCI (00:13:48) impact.
Despite the challenging rate environment, our net interest income grew quarter-over-quarter, largely due to the
strong execution of our deposit strategy. We have demonstrated an ability to both expand our customer base
while maintaining peer-leading deposit costs. Our credit portfolio remained stable and our disciplined approach to
managing expenses is evident in our quarterly adjusted efficiency ratio of 49.4%.
Slide 20 includes thoughts on our outlook for the remainder of 2023. We believe our current pipeline should
support second half 2023 loan growth in the low- to mid-single digit range, with full year growth in the mid- to high-
single digit range. We continue to target at or above industry deposit growth and we are reconfirming our guide on
9% to 12% year-over-year net interest income increase, with a stronger conviction towards the higher end of this
range. The key assumptions in this guidance include one more rate hike and a through-the-cycle interest-bearing
deposit beta of 43% to 53% by year-end and non-interest-bearing deposits falling to 28%.
We expect fee businesses to be stable in the back half of 2023, with the exception of the $4 million in non-run rate
items we noted earlier. Our expense outlook is adjusted to approximately $949 million for full year 2023, excluding
merger-related charges and property optimization-related expenses. This reflects our prior guidance of $939
million adjusted upward by $10 million for higher incentive accruals. $5 million of this has already been accrued at
quarter-end.
Provision expense should continue to be limited to loan growth, portfolio changes, and non-PCD charge-offs as
we believe we have adequate reserves against the PCD book. Turning to taxes, we expect approximately $8
million in tax credit amortization for the remainder of 2023, with a corresponding full year effective tax rate of 25%
on a core FTE basis and 23% on a GAAP basis.
With those comments, I'd like to open up the call for your questions. We do have the full team available, including
Mark Sander, Jim Sandgren, and John Moran.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Okay.
We'll take our first question from Ben Gerlinger with Hovde Group. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Hey. Good morning, everyone.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Good morning, Ben.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Hate to do a modeling question upfront, but you guys gave a lot of guidance with both the left and right side of the
balance sheet, more specifically to the cost of liabilities and deposits going forward. The one piece that I think was
missing, and I kind of just backed into it a little bit, was the average earning asset yield or what you might see on
an uptick in terms of the next rate hike?
So, it – putting it all together, I'm coming up with a margin around a 3.4% kind of at year-end. I might be off by a
couple of bps here and there. But is that – do you think that's a fair assumption? And then, how – what would be
some possible factors that could be above or below that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, Old National Bancorp
Yes. I think you're in the ballpark, Ben. I think, what we need to think about is what is the velocity of deposit
pricing going forward and how well can we do against that deposit beta guide we got. I can tell you today, the
velocity does [ph] seem to have (00:17:30) slowed. I know we're one month into the third quarter, but I think
there's some potential upside there.
And we do have a – still a significant amount of fixed asset repricing – fixed pricing assets that will reprice for the
next 12 months. That's meaningful and could – and should help defer a lot of this kind of late-cycle deposit
repricing that we have. So, I think, those are the two items that can probably offset margin pressure going
forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Got you. And then, just kind of following up on that. Is that just erring on the side of conservatism? Because you
guys do have a really healthy deposit franchise that you're beta kind of – that doesn't whipsaw nearly as much as
some of the lower-quality peers, I guess, you could say. So, like is it more just elongation? It just seems a little
conservative to me, but you guys probably have a better vantage point.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2023
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, Old National Bancorp
I think our through-the-cycle deposit beta that we've put out there I think – that range, I think, seems reasonable.
Time will tell. But what we can – we continue to say, whatever [ph] deposit beta is due (00:18:37) for the industry,
we think we outperform it at the end of the day. That's our best guess today in this environment. And will we try to
outperform it? Absolutely. One thing I – we're certainly confident in is we can be better than peers.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Got you. That's great. And then, have one more kind of just changing topics a little bit. You guys kind of
historically modeled for the worst case scenario based on Moody's S-3. And with that as the backdrop, if you guys
are slowing loan growth, does that kind of negate the economic factors associated with CECL or is it more bad
could get worse in their modeling, therefore, you go lower? What I'm really getting at here is, if you're slowing loan
growth, should the provision come down as well, assuming there's no credit events?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, Old National Bancorp
The out provision should be generally limited to loan growth and non-PCD charge-offs. And so, if loan growth
moderates a little bit, that should moderate provisioning expense going forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Benjamin Gerlinger Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
All right. [ph] It's all (00:19:40) good. Appreciate it. Great quarter. Hope the rest of year continues this trend.

Operator: Good. Next, we'll go to Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Your line's open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Morning, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Just wanted to ask a question on NII. So, obviously a really
good performance. I'm glad to see the sturdy guide. Brendon, maybe if you could offer just sort of any thoughts
you might have or be comfortable with on sort of when and why you would see NII ultimately bottoming?
And to the extent possible, what would happen to it thereafter? I mean, presumably it becomes a function of loan
growth and sort of back book repricing, but maybe just sort of nuances of upcoming ebbs and flows and NII in the
aggregate?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, Old National Bancorp
Scott, yeah, I think it's impossible to predict with any level of kind of precision when NII bottoms out and at what
level. I can tell you that we continue to run [ph] an asset-intensive (00:20:39) balance sheets, and the next rate
hike will help offset any deposit headwinds, as we've talked about a little earlier. I think, the pace of deposit
8


Old National Bancorp
(ONB) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2023
repricing has slowed a little bit. So I don't want to call the end. But, certainly, there's more probably downside
pressure than upside opportunity at this point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And as it relates to the non-interest-bearing deposits, which I – so I think we have them going down to – or
assuming they go down to 28% from roughly 30% today, maybe just sort of the background as to what you guys
are thinking that leads you to believe that's the right number? In other words, what are sort of the risks, but also
what you're seeing that that suggests they will settle out fairly soon?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, Old National Bancorp
Yes. We're monitoring the pace of that transition out of non-interest-bearing into higher-interest-bearing account.
It's probably maybe the most aggressive of the assumptions in there, but probably has maybe the smallest impact
in terms of our guides. So, I don't think it moves around our NII guidance significantly if we missed that by a
couple of percentage points. It – but, Scott, honestly, it's our best guess. That's a tough one to call, but we're
monitoring the behaviors and we feel comfortable with that level now and we'll update you if that changes.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Let's stick with the deposit discussion here. And the question I have is, it seems like June, there was a lot of
competition as banks wanted to show deposit growth in the quarter. Is your sense that maybe deposit competition
has eased in July? And then, as a second part of that, through – throughout the second quarter and into here in
July, where are you seeing the biggest competition? Is it the GSIBs? Is it the regionals? Is it the community
banks? Where is it most competitive? Thanks.

Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. I don't think that – David, it's Mark. I don't think that competition has eased. I would say, the pace of
increases has eased, is what Brendon was trying to convey. So, we stay competitive. We're staying in the upper
half of the market in terms of our rate positioning. And I just think there's still fierce competition.
And where is it coming from? Frankly, everywhere. And so, more of the mid-sized banks than anything else. The
SIFIs don't have to compete as much as a – but all of our markets have plenty of competition, and I think it's still
pretty healthy out there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Got it. Cool. Okay. And then, secondly, wanted to ask about your appetite to hire additional commercial bankers. I
know you guys have had a lot of success over the last year or two in that. Are you still looking to hire within your
footprint? And if so, what does the commercial banker that's attractive to you look like?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
Well, the answer to your question is yes. So, we'll always stay in the market. We've got a long-term view. And
we've said it a lot but we'll repeat it, good revenue producers pay for themselves quickly even in this environment.
We're building a model for the long term, and people – we've got a good story to tell and we want to take
advantage of that when people are looking to make a move and, frankly, be proactive with people who might not
be looking to make a move.
We have slowed the pace of hiring this year largely because we don't need to add folks. We just are being
opportunistic. But we still hired nine revenue producers across wealth and commercial in Q2, and we'll continue to
look for it. The prototypical profile is a seasoned – a 10 to 15 or more of your banker who's relationship banking
within our markets, I guess, is the best way to put it.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, Brendon, maybe another one for you. If – I think market consensus is that we stay higher for longer after this
week's Fed move. If that plays out to the earlier comments on margin, should the narrative get a little bit harder
next year? Or is it kind of a balancing act where you can kind of hold margins [ph] in NII (25:02)?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, Old National Bancorp
I think it's a balancing act, right? It's Fed fight. It's Fed fight to hold margin, which we all play. I can – and I think
we have an advantage over most others given our – the quality of our deposit franchise, with the velocity of
deposit cost can slow. Like I said, we have a lot of earning assets at fixed rates that are going to reprice
meaningfully higher. Our fixed rate book is going to reprice at 180 basis points above kind of runoff yields. [ph] Or
investment portfolio that we're reinvesting into loans (25:30) is plus 400 basis points. So yeah. I think we have the
tools and the balance sheet to help fight for flat in a higher for longer rate environment.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, that's helpful. And then in terms of capital, Jim, you talked to just about everything's kind of on hold given
the environment. What are you looking for to kind of maybe make a switch to returning more capital?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
There's an awful lot to play out here with respect to the economy and the last rate move. I think like all investors,
right? I mean, they we're trying to answer those questions. And then I think we get more comfort in how do we
think about returning capital and which form. So I think, I think we get more clarity as the year continues to
progress and would have better OpEx heading into next year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And maybe if I could just sneak one more in. Brendon, the – I think you mentioned $4 million of kind of non-
run rate fees. So that would put you kind of [ph] 77, 78 (26:34) kind of ballpark for quarterly fees. I wanted to try
and understood that. And then, given the tax benefit in the quarter, I know you gave the full year guide, but do you
have what the back of the envelope is for the back half of the year with that adjustment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. So I think that [indiscernible] (26:52) is the right number for fees going forward, given sort of mortgage and
capital markets headwinds. And then on the tax rate, I think that full year guide just probably approximates the
back two quarters.

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Good morning, everyone.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Good morning, Terry.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Maybe the decline in the loan pipeline, the $5.4 billion to $3.1 billion, how much of that is internal focus on the full
relationship and just tightening things up versus just less market demand out there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Terry, it's Mark. It's – I won't put percentages out of it but more is driven by our internal – our focus than it is
external. I mean, certainly, CRE markets have retracted a bit and are not as active. So there's some of that. But
more of it is – frankly, [indiscernible] (27:54) balance sheet. And as Jim and Brendon both alluded to our
comments, we're a relationship bank and we always are that way. But occasionally, you – in the past, you got
time where you leave with credit in this environment. We're not doing that. Deposits have to come as they want.
And if the pipeline didn't have – reflect that, we move them out of the pipeline. So we've rationed our pipeline
down proactively.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks, guys. And then just overall managing the size of the balance sheet, what's your appetite for additional
loan sales and will the cash flow from the securities portfolio be utilized to fund loan growth?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, Terry. This is Brendon. Yeah. We lastly use the investment portfolio to continue to fund loans. And I think to
the extent that deposits continue to grow to fund our loan growth. We'll use that. If it doesn't, there's opportunities
to continue to pare but it won't be significant or sizable.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And maybe just one last one. I mean, the expense guide. I just want to make sure it fully captures what Jim talked
about in terms of the Southeast Michigan, and the Detroit build out. What you're doing in wealth management.
What you're doing in Nashville. You've got a lot of growth initiatives, but you've really been able to self-fund it and

haven't raised the expense guidance, which I think has been a real positive surprise. I'm just making sure all
those initiatives you feel like are captured in that – in the expense guide for this year.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, Old National Bancorp
Yes, Terry. Absolutely. It's all captured in it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
That's the goal, right? I mean, I think, we have continued opportunities to invest in people and any technology
needs. But at the same time, we've got to figure out ways to self-fund that. And so, we want to be incredibly
disciplined around what that looks like.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
I totally agree. Thanks for taking my questions.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Thanks, Terry.

Operator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to Brody Preston with UBS. Your line is open.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, everyone.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Good morning, Brody.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey, I just wanted to follow up. Brendon, I think you said that there might be some, I think, upside on NII or maybe
it was Jim that said that just depending on what happens with the velocity of the deposit beta guide. I think the
spot rate in the deck – excuse me, you said was 198. And so, I guess, how has the velocity changed from that
198 level?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, Old National Bancorp
Yeah, it slowed materially, but it's early days in the quarter. And so we don't want to declare victory and say that's
a permanent change of velocity. But we have seen some positive trends on that front and, obviously, we'll
continue to watch it.

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2023
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And I saw the uptick in broker deposits quarter-over-quarter and it looked like it was fairly spread out
between the front-end and the back-end. But I wanted to ask just like, just given – NIBs came in a bit better than
what I expected. Are you guys planning on maybe slowing the pace of brokered or is there a potential for you to
pay brokered deposits back? And would that kind of feed into maybe a slowing of the increase in the deposit cost
trajectory?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. It's all about core deposit growth trajectory to the extent that we continue to grow core deposits at rates,
you know, better than brokered. We'll continue to do that and de-emphasize our use of broker.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Okay. And then the last one for me, just in terms of the loan pipeline. I'm sorry if I missed it. Do you have a
sense for, I guess, what portion of it is kind of fixed rate versus floating rate at this point? And what kind of new
fixed rate origination yields are?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. Yeah. We do. It's about 75% floating and 25% fixed.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And is there a difference between what the origination yields are on the fixed rate versus the floating rate?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, Old National Bancorp
Yeah. We actually put it in the slide deck. So our floating rate just in June was 7.61% and fixed was around just
above 6%. That could move up a little bit given a potential, obviously, rate hike coming here shortly.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
What drives that delta, Brendon, between commercial fixed and commercial floating being 150 basis points to 160
basis points kind of difference at this point in the rate cycle?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, Old National Bancorp
Yes, it's a swap curve. You think about the average tenure of these fixed rate deals five years. That five-year
swap curve is about that below.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Got it. Okay. Great. Well, thank you very much for taking my questions. I appreciate it.

Operator: Next, we'll go to Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, thanks. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James C. Ryan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
Good morning, Jon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
A couple of follow-ups. Just on the margin, Brendon, to just put it all together. Do you feel like is the margin
inflecting now? I mean, if the Fed has done this week, is it inflecting sentimently in your mind?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brendon B. Falconer A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, Old National Bancorp
I think that – I think there's probably more downward pressure than upward opportunity in this. But it's still
dependent on, again, the velocity of deposit repricing and where these terminal betas end up. There's
opportunities to continue to grow NII in the earning asset side, because of fixed rate assets repricing. Is it enough
to offset it? We just don't know yet.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Slide 14. This is great because it's – you don't have exposure to the central business districts. So I think the
banks that don't have the exposure tend to talk about it more openly. But you're in a lot of big cities. What are you
seeing in terms of central business district office real estate? Is it – do you feel like it's as big as a problem as you
make it out to be on the outside? Just curious what you're seeing.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark G. Sander A
President & Chief Operating Officer, Old National Bancorp
I think you just answered your own question. I think it's not as big of a problem as it's made out to be. And yet, we
all have our eye on it. It's not like it's robust and there aren't much in the way of new opportunities, certainly. But
the risk there exists. I think it's perhaps a little overly stressed in the media. I think, we have – are as well circled
and to extent, we need to [ph] well reserve for the couple of opportunities that where there are issues (34:36).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Okay. Good. And then Jim, one for you. Anything on regulatory concerns? You're on the – you're well
under a $100 billion. But what – anything that you're hearing that you think would have an [ph] over – outsized
impact (34:54) on Old National?

Q2 2023 Earnings Call 25-Jul-2023
James C. Ryan A
Chief Executive Officer & Director, Old National Bancorp
I think, obviously, we're paying really close attention to what's being said out there. And we have always been in
the position of having good regulatory relationships. And this is now not the time to reduce any emphasis on the
work you do, right? And so we just got to continue to improve it at every single thing we do to meet regulatory
expectations – exceed regulatory expectations.
But as I see those things, I think that the toughest ones seem to be aimed at banks north of $100 billion. And
obviously, there's a lot of distance between where we're at today and that number. So I think, we're in a great
spot. I actually think we're in the sweet spot for kind of profitability in terms of banks our size, where we have the
scale to go off and hire and invest in technology. And yet, we'll maybe miss some of the toughest things that come
to our industry. So I think we're in a really strong spot to be for the next few years.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah. I agree. Returns look really good. So all right. Thank you. Appreciate it.
