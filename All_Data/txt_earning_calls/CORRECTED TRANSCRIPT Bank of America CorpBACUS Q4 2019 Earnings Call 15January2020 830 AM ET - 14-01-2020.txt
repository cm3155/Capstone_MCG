Q4 2019 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2020
Brian T. Moynihan
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Thank you, Lee. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our results. I'm going to let Paul
take you through the fourth quarter which reflected a strong finish to close out 2019. Before that, I want to give
you a high level view on our results. Of course, our results continue to reflect the strength of the US consumer in
the biggest economy in the world. We continue to be well-positioned here in driving market share gains and great
servicing capabilities.
This quarter is also one of transition from a period of rising rates in 2018 to one that is moving through the impact
of the declining rates in the second half of 2019. How do you run a company, a big bank and deal with lower
rates? Well, we drive what we can control with our sempiternal commitment to responsible growth. We drive more
loans, more deposits, more assets under management and driving growth with the right pricing and at the right
risks. We also have to manage our cost base carefully while making the required investments, and we have to
take advantage of the strong balance sheet to provide good capital return to our shareholders.
At Bank of America, we check the box in all these in the quarter. We grew loans – average loans by 6% in our
lines of businesses. We grew the deposits by 5% with very disciplined deposit pricing. Our expenses were
relatively flat again while we increased investments across our whole company. And in doing that, we earned $7
billion after tax this quarter with a return on tangible common equity of 15.4%. And due to our strong balance
sheet, we returned $9.1 billion in capital to our common shareholders this quarter. At the same time we deployed
capital to support growth for our clients, communities and teammates.
Let's start on slide 2. I'm referring to the full year results excluding our third quarter 2019 joint venture impairment
charge. We generated $29 billion in net income in 2019, a record for our company. That was 3% better than the
prior year's results. We were also able to reduce shares by 9%, driving earnings per share up by 12% for 2019.
These results were driven by execution on all the pillars of responsible growth. We grew by serving our clients
well and improved our market share across the board, remained disciplined in our risk and our client selection
framework.
And by the way, our results are more sustainable as our focus on operational excellence led to a 58% efficiency
ratio in 2019 while making the investments we need to make. Our return on equity was 11% for the year, and our
return on tangible common equity was 15.8% for the year. Record earnings allowed us to invest in our client
capabilities, invest in our people and invest in our communities, all while holding the expenses in check.
Take a look at slide 3. You can see the investments we made across all our constituencies and, at the same time,
we delivered strong returns for our shareholders. To deliver for our clients, we continued our investment in talent.
In 2019 we grew the company by 3,600 teammates. Overall, we hired 32,000 teammates in 2019, including 6,300
new employees from low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, 4,000 college and MBA graduates and we also
completed our five-year goal to hire 10,000 military veterans into our company.
We completed more than $3 billion in new technology code initiatives last year, building on years' investments in
award-winning digital and mobile capabilities to serve our clients better and help our teammates be more efficient.
Most importantly, these investments are bearing fruit, as you can see in our customer usage numbers that Paul
will talk about.
Just a simple example, we surpassed 10 million clients using Erica, our industry-leading consumer AI agent. We
introduced Erica about 18 months ago and now are starting to reap the scale benefits. Erica is an example of
billions of dollars of scaled innovation fueled by our work on operational excellence. These savings generated by

operational excellence also enabled us to make capital investments in our company of $1.7 billion during 2019 for
newer, modernized facilities and other related priorities. And in the past three years, we've built 207 new financial
centers and modernized more than 1,300. For our employees, we will start at $20 per hour minimum starting pay
beginning in March.
The cost of all these enhancements, importantly, are in our run rate of expenses, providing the capacity to keep
investing in the future without increasing expenses. Also for 2019, for the third consecutive year we shared our
financial success with our teammates with special compensation awards to approximately 95% of them. Three
years of special compensation awards totaled $1.6 billion in compensation in addition to all other bonuses and
merit and everything else, allowing our teammates to do more with their families.
Last year, we also delivered more than $5 billion of community development financing for affordable housing and
other important local priorities. We've made more than $250 of philanthropic contributions to help drive economic
mobility, including workforce training and development and many other local priorities where we help to make a
difference. We also completed our 10-year, $125 billion environmental business initiative goal in 2019. We've
made that commitment four years ago, and it was a 10-year commitment, and we completed it 6 years early.
That's why this year we set a new goal of $300 billion environmental initiatives across the next decade.
It was a strong year for our company and our team capping our first decade. But here at Bank of America, we
have a saying: nice start. We know we can do so much more in the future. So, on slide 4 I want to talk about the
line of business results. The team's hard work has created strong improvement in earnings across the board in
our lines of business. Dean Athanasia and the Consumer team generated an impressive $13 billion in after-tax
earnings in our Consumer and Small Business group by driving responsible growth. They continue to provide real
value for clients through innovative products and services while driving improvements in upgraded facilities,
entering new markets and driving innovation. Consumer's record level efficiency and customer satisfaction scores
reflect our hard work done the right way.
Andy Sieg and Katy Knox together run our Global Wealth Investment Management businesses. They drove net
new household growth in 2019 and more integration across those businesses with the rest of the franchise. Merrill
Lynch alone brought in more than 40,000 net new affluent households during 2019. Margins in that business
remain near the record levels. We generated $1 billion-plus in quarterly earnings in the quarters of 2019 and
topped this quarter at $3 trillion in client balances for the first time.
Tom Montag and his team across the Global Banking and Global Markets franchises are running one of the
biggest commercial lending businesses in the world and one of the top market-making investment banking
platforms. This powerful combination of Global Banking and Global Markets generated $11.6 billion in after-tax
net income this year. The team continues to get its fair share of the fee pools across the globe and became more
important partners for many of the world's largest clients.
With a renewed focus, our investment banking team regained some of the lost market share from a couple years
ago, and Paul will give you those numbers later. Matthew Koder and team have done a great job of doing that. In
addition, that team across the board continues to drive innovation in our global treasury services platform. Paul is
going to show you some of those capabilities in the slides later. All these business accomplishments across all
these businesses while driving relatively flat costs.
Let's move to trends in slide 5. Our strong balance sheet and strong earnings have driven a corresponding strong
increase in our return of capital. We have now dropped below 9 billion shares outstanding, 9.1 billion shares on a
fully diluted basis, as shown here on the left side of the page. In total, we reduced the share count by nearly 2.5

billion shares from its peak a few years ago. As we look into 2020, Paul will give you some specific guidance on
the company's view of what we see and our outlook. But for more general guidance, our research team, our
award-winning research team, sees more generally the US GDP growth at just below 2% and a global GDP
growth just above 3%.
We at Bank of America see in our Consumer business a substantial amount of activity. In our Consumer
business, we see that our customers are coming off a strong finish in 2019 in their spending activity. In addition,
there's good loan demand. This results from good employment levels and growing wages. At Bank of America,
spending by our consumers grew at 5.9% over $3 trillion in spending from 2019 over 2018.
We saw solid loan demand in our commercial client base throughout the year but that moderated in the second
half of the year as worries about global economic uncertainty and all the issues that are talked about every day
dragged on. Today, we see some resolution of those issues and that combined with continued consumer strength
leads us to expect to see businesses continue their solid activity and we're hearing more optimism. All this
provides a great backdrop to drive responsible growth and continue to deliver for you.
With that, I'll turn it over to Paul.

Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Thanks, Brian. Good morning everyone. You can see the summary of our Q4 results on slide 6, and I'm going to
begin on slide 7. In the fourth quarter we reported $7 billion in net income and $0.74 in EPS. EPS increased 6%
from Q4 2018 reflecting modestly lower earnings, more than offset by a 9% reduction in average diluted shares.
Returns remained strong in Q4 with a return on assets of 113 basis points, and a return on tangible common
equity of 15%, well above the company's cost of capital.
Our results were driven by our team's focus and solid progress on managing what we can control and gaining
market share in an economy that grew at a low-single digit pace. In Q4, we again stayed focused on what we can
control. Client activity remains solid, allowing the benefits of loan and deposit growth to aid in offsetting the
negative impact of lower short-term rates over the past three quarters. We also continued to see healthy
consumer trends in spending and asset quality. Lastly, we experienced a nice rebound in FICC trading from a
more negative environment a year ago.
So having set the stage, let's turn to the details starting with the balance sheet on slide 8. Overall, compared to
the end of Q3, the balance sheet was relatively flat at $2.4 trillion, as growth of both loans and securities was
modestly offset by lower global market assets. Deposits grew $42 billion and were first deployed to fund $11
billion of loan growth with most of the excess funding the growth in debt securities. Liquidity improved as the
average global liquidity sources benefited from deposit growth. Shareholders' equity declined $4 billion, driven
mostly by the return of excess capital. In Q4 we returned $9.1 billion in capital through net share repurchases and
dividends, which exceeded the $7 billion earned. OCI declined by roughly $1 billion. Note our book value per
share of $27.32 has improved 9% from Q4 2018.
With respect to regulatory metrics, we remain comfortably above our minimum requirements driven by the return
of the excess capital I just reviewed. Our CET1 standardized ratio decreased to 11.2% but remained well above
our 9.5% minimum requirement. Our risk-weighted assets increased modestly from consumer loan growth and
increased Global Banking exposures. Lastly, our TLAC ratio also remained comfortably above our requirements.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2020
Looking at how client activity impacted average balances, let's start with deposits on slide 9. Average deposits
grew $65 billion or 5% year-over-year. For 4.5 years now, we have grown deposits on a year-over-year basis
every quarter by more than $40 billion. Consumer Banking deposits grew $33 billion or 5% as we believe
customers value the convenience of our financial centers and ATM network, leading online and mobile
capabilities and our unique Preferred Rewards program. But much of this growth continues to be led by checking
balances, which we considered to be the core operational deposits of these customers. Wealth Management
deposits grew $8 billion or 3% year-over-year. Global Banking deposits grew $19 billion or 5% year-over-year and
reflected both our strong GTS platform and the additional bankers we have deployed over the past couple of
years.
Looking at average loans on slide 10, you see pretty consistent client activity. Overall, average loans of $974
billion were up more than 4% year-over-year. More importantly, average loans in our lines of business grew $54
billion or 6% year-over-year as consumer loans grew 7% and commercial loans grew 6%. As you can see in the
bottom right-hand chart, we continued to demonstrate a fairly consistent range of responsible growth. Commercial
loan growth was broad-based. Loans to middle market clients grew 10%. But I would note the more stable linked-
quarter balances here as revolver utilization moved a bit lower. We also saw growth in lending to small
businesses growing 7%, and within consumer we saw strong growth of residential mortgages. I would also note
the stability of credit card balances which reflects our decision last year to pull back on less profitable promotional
balances as we continued to prioritize sustainable long-term profitability.
Turning to slide 11 and net interest income. On a GAAP non-FTE basis in Q4, NII was $12.1 billion, $12.3 billion
on an FTE basis, and was relatively flat compared to Q3 2019. The benefits of loan and deposit growth coupled
with disciplined pricing mostly offset the impact across short-term rates of a linked-quarter 47-basis-point decline
in the average Fed funds rate. And while long-term rates were up modestly on a spot basis, on average for the
quarter, there was little change.
For the full year of 2019, GAAP NII of $48.9 billion was up 1%, despite lower short-term rates. This is consistent
with the perspective we had conveyed to you since the middle of the year. We remained disciplined with respect
to deposit pricing. In Q4, the rate paid on total interest-bearing deposits of 61 basis points declined 15 basis
points. In Consumer Banking, which accounts for more than half of our $1.4 trillion of deposits, customer pricing
remained relatively unchanged. On the other hand, in Global Banking and Wealth Management, the decline from
Q3 and the rate paid on interest-bearing deposits was more in line with the 38-basis-point drop in average one-
month LIBOR.
Okay. Looking forward, as we move into 2020, let me start by saying our expectations assume a stable economic
and interest rate environment, i.e. flat rates, relative to the end of the year. Given those assumptions, we expect
NII in Q1 to be lower than Q4 as the benefits of loan and deposit growth will be more than offset by three things.
First, with respect to Q1, we will have one less day of interest. Second, we expect lower loan yields to be more
fully reflected from the late October Fed rate cut. Third, reinvestment rates are expected to dilute securities yields
despite fractionally higher long end rates.
Moving to Q2, we typically experience seasonally lower NII for two reasons. First, we typically see higher interest
expense from funding increased seasonal Global Markets client activity in Equities. The benefit of this activity
shows up in noninterest income instead of interest income. Second, we also typically see lower average card
balances as clients pay down their holiday balances. Both of these seasonal patterns have historically led to lower
NII in Q2 compared to Q1. So, we would expect NII in the first two quarters of 2020 to be a bit lower than Q4
2019. From there, we would expect NII to rise modestly in the second half of the year, driven by an additional day
of interest and continued loan and deposit growth.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2020
Turning to slide 12 and quarterly expenses over the past two years. At $13.2 billion this quarter, expenses were
1% higher than Q4 2018, as increased investments throughout 2019 in people, real estate and technology
initiatives were largely offset by savings from operational excellence and lower amortization of intangibles. We
have been operating in a tight range for more than two years now, with quarterly expense in the low $13 billion
range in all but one quarter if you adjust for the 3Q 2019 impairment. So, annually, we've been able to maintain a
$53 billion expense base despite increased investments in tech, infrastructure, buildings, people, philanthropy and
the other costs that Brian mentioned in the opening of the call.
With respect to head count, year-over-year savings from improved processes and workflows allowed us to fund
an increase in the number of sales professionals as our LOBs added nearly 4,000 associates over the past 12
months. With respect to outlook, our expectations for expense in 2020 haven't really changed from where we
provided it in 2016 despite all the added costs of the higher investments and unknowns like Brexit and others
since 2016. We expect our full year expense to be in the low $53 billion range this year, and as long as client
activity and the economic environment remains stable, our investment plans will likely remain unchanged.
Having said that, I want to provide you with a few reminders with respect to expenses. First, Q1 is expected to
include about $400 million of seasonally elevated personnel costs related to payroll taxes, with the remaining
quarters of 2020 expected to return to a low $13 billion range. Also, beginning in Q3, the accounting for the BAMS
JV is expected to change following its dissolution. At that time, we will separately record revenue and expense
from merchant servicing operations rather than reflecting our share of the joint venture earnings as a single
amount in other income. This will gross up both expenses and revenue with little bottom line impact and, like we
told you in Q3, it's not included in our forward guidance. We will update you as we move closer to that timeframe.
All right. Turning to asset quality on slide 13, our underwriting standards have been responsible and strong for
years now, and asset quality trends reflect this even in this relatively benign credit environment. Total net charge-
offs in Q4 were $959 million compared to $811 million in Q3. When comparing to Q3, remember we sold in Q3 –
we sold some loans in Q3 that resulted in recoveries totaling $198 million that reduced net charge-offs. Adjusting
for those recoveries, net charge-offs declined $50 million and the net charge-off ratio declined 3 basis points to 39
basis points. Compared to Q4 2018, net charge-offs were modestly higher, driven primarily by seasoning of the
card portfolio. Provision expense was $941 million and mostly masked net charge-offs with only modest releases
in both Q4 2019 and Q4 2018.
On slide 14, we break out credit quality metrics for both our Consumer and Commercial portfolios. These metrics
show you that asset quality remained strong in both categories. Before turning to the business segments, I will
just provide a couple of perspectives on CECL. Our day one implementation resulted in a $3.3 billion increase in
allowance. This is in line with the last update we gave you. All else equal, this would lower our CET1 ratio by
roughly 20 basis points, but as you know, it is phased into regulatory capital evenly through 2023.
Okay. Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on slide 15. Consumer Banking
produced another solid quarter of revenue and earnings but was heavily impacted by lower rates in the second
half of 2019. Net income of $3.1 billion declined 10% as revenue fell 4%. As you know, we have been renovating
and adding financial centers, adding sales professionals and advancing digital capabilities, plus we increased our
minimum wage in 2019 and will again in Q1. Despite the cost of increased investments, we have been able to
hold expenses relatively flat and our efficiency ratio was 47%.
Away from the impact of rates, which we can't control, client momentum continued as we saw healthy spending,
borrowing and savings by clients. As a result, year-over-year average deposits increased by $33 billion, up 5% to

$720 billion, while maintaining strong pricing discipline. Client investments increased to $54 billion, up 29% year-
over-year, to $240 billion, driven primarily by the market but we also saw $20 billion of client flows and our total
net accounts grew 7%. Loans were up a healthy 7% driven by home loans. Debit and credit spending by our
customers was up 6% year-over-year, consistent with a record holiday season, and asset quality in this segment
remained strong with a net charge-off ratio of 118 basis points, down modestly from last year.
Turning to slide 16, I will quickly note continued positive trends across deposits, loans and investments, all of
which I touched upon earlier. This level of activity continues to drive the acknowledgements and rankings in the
upper left. And this is a short list of the more than 60 industry awards Consumer and digital banking received in
2019.
Turning to slide 17. Digital banking continued to drive growth and client engagement as we continued to invest
heavily in this channel as a strong complement to our financial centers and ATM network. Together they allowed
our customers to bank with us anywhere, anytime and anyway they want. Over 56% of our clients are now
digitally active and logged in 8.1 billion times this year. That's up 9% year-over-year.
Digital channels generated 27% of overall sales. 34% of mortgages and 56% of client direct auto loans originated
through our mobile app or online banking sites. The Digital Mortgage Experience itself originated $11 billion in
loans in 2019, as we continue to add capabilities such as the ability to transfer HELOC balances on a mobile
device. And with respect to mobile car shopping, we closed the year with the ability to provide clients access to
roughly 2 million cars from our participating dealer inventories.
Our market share of Zelle Payments continued to increase this year as well. We now have 9.7 million Zelle users,
and they sent and received 300 million transfers this year, totaling over $78 billion. Erica surpassed 10 million
total users and completed nearly 100 million requests since its launch, with 38% penetration of active BAC mobile
users. 27% of total deposits are now coming from mobile and over 50% of our clients have gone completely
paperless, enhancing our efficiency and their experience. And customers increased their use of our mobile
banking app to make appointments with 2.3 million digital appointments scheduled in 2019, up 19% year-over-
year. Our efforts to move customers past enrollment to engagement in digital capabilities are stronger than ever
and, we believe, industry-leading.
Turning to Global Wealth and Investment Management on slide 18, strong results were led by growth across
AUM, loans and deposits as well as good market conditions in the quarter but also reflected the headwinds of
lower interest rates. Record level client balances topped $3 trillion, and our full year pre-tax margin was 29%.
With $256 billion in deposits, this segment would rank standalone as the seventh or eighth largest bank in the US.
So when rates fall [ph] GWIM feels it (00:28:18) but much of the impact of falling rates was offset by advisory fees
generated from our industry-leading Wealth Management platform.
Net income was just over $1 billion, down 4% from Q4 2018, reflecting lower interest rates and the absence of a
prior year gain from the sale of a noncore asset which also impacted the revenue comparisons. Excluding the
prior year gain, revenue was flat and earnings grew 3%. Asset management fees grew 5% year-over-year due to
higher market valuations and the fees from AUM flows which more than offset general pricing pressures and
lower transactional revenue. Expenses decreased slightly as investments in sales professionals, technology and
our brand were more than offset by lower intangible amortization and deposit insurance costs. Digital engagement
with affluent clients continued to increase in importance, as 64% of Merrill clients are actively using our mobile or
online platforms, and that statistic increased to more than 75% for our Private Bank clients.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2020
Moving to slide 19, GWIM activity reflects the confidence clients place in Bank of America and its advisors at both
Merrill and the Private Bank. As Brian mentioned, household growth has been strong, as Merrill added more than
40,000 net new households this year, and we added 60% more Private Bank relationships in 2019 than we did in
2018. On the bottom right, note the $427 billion increase in client balances in Q4 2018, $383 billion of that
increase reflected strong market conditions increasing the value of assets, $44 billion of the increase is from client
flows. AUM flows accounted for $25 billion while brokerage flows contributed $6 billion. Banking product flows
were driven by loans of $12 billion, which doubled from 2018. And deposit flows were modestly negative as
clients shifted cash back into investments during the year following the 4Q 2018 equity market declines. Average
deposits rose 3%.
Turning to Global Banking on slide 20. The business earned $2 billion and generated 20% return on allocated
capital in the quarter. An 8% decline in net income was driven by lower NII and higher investment costs, which
outpaced the improvement from investment banking income and leasing related gains. Continued strong deposit
and loan growth reflects the benefit of adding hundreds of bankers over the past few years, increasing our client
coverage, as well as continued advancement in how we deliver our loan product and treasury services. These
investments will continue to benefit the franchise for many years to come, as new bankers deepen existing
relationships and add new ones.
Looking at trends on slide 21 and comparing to Q4 last year. Throughout the year, we continued to add
investment bankers both in the US and internationally with a focus on expanding our client coverage. This
benefited NII fees with Q4 fees of nearly $1.5 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Double-digit increases in both debt
and equity underwriting fees led the year-over-year improvement. Bank of America was involved in 7 of the top 10
debt deals and 6 of the top 10 equity deals in the quarter. Based upon Dealogic data, this performance drove a 50
basis point improvement in market share for the full year.
Turning to slide 22. One of the reasons for the growth in deposits in Global Banking has been our consistent
investment over multiple years in digital capabilities and transaction services. Note the growth in mobile and
digital usage at the top of the page and our focus on solutions for clients on the bottom of the page.
Switching to Global Markets on slide 23, as I usually do, I will talk about results excluding DVA. Global Markets
produced $639 million of earnings. Year-over-year revenue was up 10% from both higher sales and trading
results and improved investment banking fees. Expenses were up a more modest 2% year-over-year. Within
revenue, sales and trading improved 13% year-over-year, driven by fixed income, currency and commodities with
a more risk-on environment when compared to Q4 last year. FICC was up 25% from Q4 2014 while Equities
declined modestly. FICC revenue showed improved results across most products, but was particularly strong in
mortgage products. The muted performance in Equities was driven by lower client activities and derivatives, which
was partially offset by our financing business where we have focused some investments.
On slide 24, you can see that our mix of sales and trading revenue remains weighted to domestic activity where
global fee pools are centered. Within FICC, revenue mix remained weighted towards credit products. And
importantly, please note on the bottom left, at roughly $13 billion the consistency of our sales and trading revenue
over the past six years in the face of declining fee pools. It is particularly noteworthy considering the risk reduction
noted at the bottom right. This goes against the perception that these revenues are generally considered to be
more variable.
Finally, turning to slide 25, we show All Other, which reported a profit of $262 million. Comparing against Q3 2019
is tough because that period included the $2.1 billion pre-tax impairment charge on our Bank of America
Merchant Services joint venture. But there are two things worth noting as I close out. First, other income. At the

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2020
total company level this quarter included tax-advantaged investment partnership losses that were about $200
million higher when you compare to Q3. The benefits of this activity shows up in our Global Banking business and
are produced by client activity related to tax-advantaged solar and wind investments. These investments generate
good returns. However, the partnership losses which reduce noninterest income and the tax benefit in our tax line
from these investments are not always realized in the same quarter depending upon the type of investment.
The second thing I want to mention is the effective tax rate in the quarter of approximately 14%. It included the
impact of higher tax credits from the increased tax-advantaged investments, and it also included roughly $300
million in discrete benefits from the resolution of several tax matters. Absent the discrete benefits in the quarter,
our Q4 2019 tax rate would have been roughly 18%, and absent any unusual items this is roughly where we
expect the ETR for full-year 2020 to be.
So thanks. And with that, I will open it up to Q&A.

Hi. Good morning. Paul, I wanted to ask on the NII outlook, when you put together your – what you – commentary
about the quarters. Year-over-year, does that imply flat to down a little bit maybe on the NII in terms of your
outlook against flat rates?

Paul M. Donofrio A

Yeah, year-over-year, modestly I would say.

Okay. And then how are you feeling, I guess, if we think about a positive operating leverage for this year, you
mentioned the stability in expenses while you continue to invest. How are you feeling on fee income growth and
when you wrap it all together, the prospects for positive operating leverage into 2020?

Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So obviously, we talked about in the prepared remarks the transition that we're going through in the rate
environment. I would just remind everybody we had 18 consecutive quarters of positive operating leverage. And
admittedly it's a little bit more difficult to achieve operating leverage given the decline in interest rates last year
and the associated impact on NII. As I said though, assuming a more stable rate environment, we would expect
NII to return to growth in the second half of 2020, driven by loan and deposit growth. And remember, NII is not
directly linked to expenses the way other revenue is in, for example, investment banking, sales and trading,
wealth management.
We run and invest in the company for the long-term sustainability and for growth. And by the way, these
investments over many years lay the foundation for operating leverage. So having said all that, we're not blind to
changes in the operating environment, but we are also not managing rigidly to quarterly financial metrics. We're
focused on the things that we can control, like driving – like client activity, deposits, loans, investments, efficiency
improvements through our focus on operational excellence. So if things change, we'll adjust, but currently we feel
our client activity and market share gains continue to support our investment plans in the near-term.

Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Thank you. I have a follow-up question on your comments on the promo balances in cards and your pullback
there. And I'm curious if that is a function of pricing getting tougher there, terms getting tougher there? Or is that
your just responsible thought process 11 years into a recovery?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
I think it's more a reflection of responsible growth and how we run – how we're focused on the customer and how
we're focused on total revenue and not necessarily NII or fees. When you look at card balances, they certainly
reflect a couple of items that we talked about, and it certainly reflects our focus more on profitability. First, we've
been re-evaluating some relationship prospects who are just looking to gain rewards or take short-term advantage
of promo balances. So clearly that's affected balances a little bit. Also, with less promo balances, the percentage
of the portfolio [ph] paying off each month (00:39:50) has risen a bit.
I think what you see though is when you look at our risk-adjusted margin, that's up 25 basis points year-over-year
to 8.7%, if you adjust out the 4Q gains we had last year. And we continue to add more than 1 million cards each
month, again with a focus on profitability of new accounts. So I think that line's going to start to grow from here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
I think, Glenn, just to be – to Paul's last point, production of new customers taking the card product from us and
the usage continues to grow. So we had 1 million-plus new cardholders. We still have a lot of room to go from a

two-thirds type of penetration of the customer base and then how many people use it as a primary card. So we
really focus a lot on that. And while we're focused on that, generating new customers who are surfing is not
exactly the strategy. So it's a mix of profitability but also really sticking to that core holistic customer strategy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Appreciate that. Just one more, maybe on GWIM. So markets up a lot and more people going fee-based, offset
lower rates and you talked about that. So we've been hanging in this 28% to 30% range which is great. But the
question I have is, as scale continues to build and all the investments that you've made there, can we see
margins start to tick up a little bit above there? I know we're constrained by payouts and things like that. Just
curious, the bigger picture over the next couple of years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yeah. So think about it in two dimensions. One, inside the Wealth Management business is a very large bank. So
if rates is stable from here, then the loan and deposit growth which have been strong will then pick up that, and
that's very leveraged to the margin or contribute to margin. That's one point. So you're going through the same
twists in that business with the 75-basis-point drop in rates in this very late part of the last few months of 2019. So
that's no different than many other situations. So that will mitigate and go forward.
If you think about the other side of the question, which is sort of can you get it higher, you've got the basic things,
the way that compensation system runs from a way of presentation is you've got 50% of the revenue, round
numbers goes into the compensation. So you're basically making $0.30 on the rather $0.50 in profit margin, which
is a pretty strong margin.
So it has all the opportunities along the dimensions which is [indiscernible] (00:42:27) set of things that we got to
go after, which is if you think about the Merrill Edge assets growing in the MEGI portfolio which is over $4 billion
and growing 30%, 50% a year type of things. As they grow and the products are available to Andy's whole team
of FAs, that provides additional efficiency. And then you think about the digitization of that customer base in both
Private Bank and Merrill Lynch which is the least penetrated of all the customer bases in terms of digital
statements and things like that, we can drive the margins that way.
Then the physical plant, we continue to increase the density of the physical plant with other physical plant in
various cities and towns, consolidating offices and getting people into common space, that saves money. So
there's a lot of way we can work on digitization, physical plant efficiency, adding more financial advisors, add
more scale and contributing to overhead, which then generates more margin.
So you're working. It's pretty good to make $0.60 – 60% of your margin after comp and we're not changing the
comp system, so. But there's a lot of things forward and I think we can continue to improve. It would appear to be
easier if, in fact, rates stay stable we can drive the loan growth, which is what our projection is. And if rates start
rising again, we'll look like heroes in terms of margin. But we've been able to sustain it even in a falling rate
environment.

Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hey, good morning. So I wanted to ask a follow-up on fee income. So the NII resiliency has been quite
impressive. Loan deposit account growth as you noted, Paul and Brian, continues to track very well. The core fee
growth was a bit softer this past year. It declined modestly despite some of the strong market tailwinds. I know,
Brian, in the past you haven't given explicit guidance on core fee growth expectations, but you did note that it
should traject in line with GDP. And just given some of the moderating US and global GDP growth expectations
you cited earlier, just trying to think about how we should be modeling or forecasting fee income expectations in
the coming years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
I think, each category – if you think about the broad categories where most of them come through, the strategy in
the Consumer business has been to reduce reliance over the last decade-plus on penalty fees and things like
that. We kind of hit status quo on that. In other words, we brought it down significantly from Reg E and all that
stuff and it's kind of done the interchange in the consumer fee areas, the card income and stuff, that's through the
system at this point. The rewards impact that, but you get the benefit that in the Preferred Rewards system
through the ability to have that stable margin.
So, I think we should see those fees, which have gotten to a point where they ought to grow marginally. But
remember part of the strategy is to invest in our client base loyalty to our company and our products. And so
they'll be modest because of the NII growth and think about 8% growth in checking balances year-over-year in
consumer. That is helped driven by people consolidating their relationship with you, which you pay back through
the rewards system through their card usage. So, it's always going to be that.
When you go to Wealth Management, you tell me what the market's going to do, and you'll see that'll be heavily
influenced there. That should grow faster. As you know, trading, as Paul said, isn't as volatile as people want to
discuss it. But on the other hand, there's compression on the fee side. So, each of the line items has a different
element. Treasury services revenue is up, I think, high-single digits, but the fee line piece of it is flattish. That's
because people are paying through balances.
So, I think that, Steven, a guy like you has been around banks for a long time. The differentiation between types
of revenue fee versus spread is becoming harder as the business models have morphed them together in just
terms of total revenue. So, we ought to grow revenue slightly faster than the economy and have the expenses
grow below that by a couple hundred basis points and we've been able to do that. And as this twist in rates ends
this quarter, you'll see us get back on that track as we move through 2020.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thanks for that color, Brian. And maybe just a follow-up for you, Paul. You've been retaining your substantial
percentage of mortgage loans on balance sheet. In lieu of selling those loans, you're deploying that excess
liquidity into MBS. And I'm just wondering as we prepare for CECL does that inform your appetite or your
willingness to continue down the same path? And just separately, just given this strength of your credit position
and a relatively clean balance sheet, was sort of hoping you guys could be CECL pioneers and maybe the first
bank to provide some more concrete guidance in terms of Day 2 provision impacts or expectations.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2020
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, on your first point, we are originating mortgages and putting 94% of them I think this quarter on the balance
sheet. They'll continue the trend that we've been doing for many quarters now. We'll see how that develops over
the long term but for now that's our plan. Clearly, we consider the effect on liquidity. We consider the effect on
capital, balancing returning capital with growing the balance sheet.
Those loans don't really have a high amount of CECL impact. But I'm not saying we're going to never change
what we're doing there. In terms of CECL, I think we've given you the guidance that we're comfortable with. We
would expect provision to be a little higher than net charge-offs in 2020 due to CECL. When you back everything
out, we've been running net charge-offs at approximately $1 billion a quarter. We don't see that changing much in
the future and when you just factor CECL into that it means that our provision is going to have to be a little bit
higher than net charge-offs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
You always have to remember that – not on the last part but on the first part – at the end of the day, the reason
why we have securities and – mortgage-backed securities and treasuries is simple. When you generate $60
billion in deposit growth and your loan balances grow by $10 billion or whatever, $10 billion or $20 billion, the
other half has to go to be invested somewhere and you're raising this money and all-in costs in the 40 basis points
of deposit pricing across the whole board and a lot of it's becoming noninterest, you're not going to turn that down
good customer activity.
And we don't take credit risk in that part of the portfolio because we take enough credit risk around the rest of the
company. And so, the strategy on the investment side mortgage-backs [ph] I put with (00:49:32) treasuries and
think of that as just excess liquidity. On mortgages, Paul told you we've been putting them on the balance sheet
because they're better yielding than mortgage-backed securities. And frankly our credit risk is better than the
mortgage-backed securities availability so why would we pay somebody else for taking that risk.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2020
Brian, ten years of excellent management here, driving the bus on improving operating leverage, especially over
the past three, four years. Can you give us a sense as to how you see the rate of change go from here? Because
we've had obviously significant improvement in the Consumer side. And the question I get from people is, is it
over? And by the way, how do you generate positive operating leverage in Global Banks and Global Markets,
given the skew to producers? And is there that much opportunity in the back office side? So, maybe if you could
hit on those, that would be helpful. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Sure. So, let me paraphrase a little bit but it's a delectation to be able to run company with all the power and have
the honor of doing it for decades. So, we just passed the decade with the team and they've done a great job. But
what you point out is they've done a great job of putting the position. So, if you look at the operating efficiency of
the Consumer business or the Wealth Management business or the Banking business, which we show separately
from the Markets business, you can see these are 38%, 40% efficiency ratios here, 45% here. It's how can you
improve.
And Betsy, what I'd say is we just don't know how far this digitization of the actual processes and work goes in the
company. And we just keep coming up – we had 6,000 simplified improved ideas over the last few years we've
implemented that continue to produce great savings. And so, we just don't see an end to that. And so, leave aside
that the economy's growing at sub-2% level predicted for 2020, leave aside that the rate environment is low.
We've been able to push forward the activities that then can produce more efficiency and we think there's a lot
ahead of us.
And so I'd like to – we say nice start to our team saying thanks for all the hard work you've done, but also we're
only getting started here. And if you start thinking about we just passed the number of checking accounts that we
had in 2007 in this company this quarter. And so, we ran off all the non-primary accounts, but on the primary
accounts, the average balance is $7,000. If you think about the cost of deposits in Consumer, I think it went down
by 4 basis points year-over-year or something like that. So, it's a grind and it's a lot of hard work but incremental
efficiency that we can get at this scale by these investments and by the digitization and the further taking out
activity which costs more.
Another example is checks written since Zelle became really pushed out there about two years ago has started
dropping 10% per year. So, five years ago we had almost 1 billion checks written by consumers. Now we're down
to 600 million. Each one of those checks is a piece of paper that requires processing time, and you're seeing that
drop by 10% a year. Is that going to change overnight where they're gone? Absolutely not. But on the other hand,
it's constant positive operating pressure, benefit for us. So, look for us to improve it across the board. Your
colleague earlier asked about the Wealth Management business. We think we have upside there, Andy and Katy
and the teams are working on it. There's a lot of process simplification that we've worked on hard, but there's a lot
ahead of us.
And then, again the Markets business, the electronification of FICC will make it more and more efficient over time
like we've seen in Equities. As you know, though, that's a market priced business so you're always fighting the
revenue changes at the same time. And in fact, if you look at most of us from four, five years ago, we actually had
the same amount of trading profits we had then. We just turn it into this quarter $600 million of profit, generally $1
billion of profit when it's going a little bit better and the earlier quarters and the activity's higher. That's a good
business. It's just you're fighting both sides of the equation.

So, look for us to improve everything. There's room to improve, tremendous scale advantages. The new markets
opening up provide extra lift, and it's our job to deal with it and the team's excited to.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Good. Good forward look there. Paul, on the longer term. Paul, maybe I could be a bit nearer term with a
question for you. I think you mentioned a couple of times that NII expectation for 2020 to being down modestly
from 2019 full year, full year. But then you talked a little bit about a better second half than first half. And maybe
you could give us a little more detail on the granularity, why you expect that to be the case. I assume it's with the
forward curve and flattish rates. But I know you gave us some color earlier on, but maybe give a little sense more
like what's behind that conviction level that year-on-year you get some improvement in the back half.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
I think it's – look, it's about loan and deposit growth and it's about deposit pricing discipline. On deposit pricing, we
plan some modest reductions in deposit pricing, assuming no further cuts as we continue to bring deposit pricing
to an appropriate level, given the three cuts that we've experienced. If the forward curve materializes and we get
another short end cut we expect deposit rate pay for the industry and for us to decline even further, as higher
pass-through products in Wealth Management, Global Banking react relatively quickly to any rate cuts.
So, it's about the confidence we have in how we price our products and the confidence we have in growing
deposits and growing loans. The guidance is more about we have one less day in Q1 we've got to deal with. We
have the second quarter, normal activity that we see in Equities which, again, that's a plus. That just shows up in
noninterest income instead of interest income. And by the time you get to the third quarter, we would expect,
assuming the current sort of economic environment, we would expect our loan and deposit growth, the lack of that
seasonality, the deposit pricing to have an effect and we'll start growing again.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
I'd just add to that. Your question, John's question, go the same direction which is you've got this quarter and the
first couple quarters because of the dynamics Paul just described that you have to push through. But what we see
is getting back on as we move into the middle of 2020, we're back on that basic operating leverage through NII
stability to growth and expense flatness. But it just takes a little while to get underneath the 75 basis point rate cut
in four months.

Hey. Good morning, guys. Maybe I could just follow up on that last question in a different way. Is your expectation
that the net interest margin should start to stabilize in the back half of the year? Is that what gives you the
confidence in the NII growth? Or is it really do we still should expect a grind down of NIMs but the balance sheet

growth starts to take over? How do we think about when in the current rate environment the sort of net interest
margin – assuming mix is unchanged, obviously that's a big assumption – but do we assume that NIM starts to
stabilize in the second half of this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

We'll reward you a bonus question for that one.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Just on the deposit growth, the industry, we've seen some acceleration in 4Q. We have lower short-term rates.
We have the Fed balance sheet expansion. There tends to be some seasonality in 4Q. How do we – do you think
this acceleration can continue into at least the first half of this year? I guess how do you think about the deposit
growth and if we could see continued sort of above mid-single-digit growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yes, I think if you look at page 9, when you have rate movement due to the types of things that reestablish
reserve levels by the Federal Reserve, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, that's going to affect the lower – our markets
business in the lower right hand – and the banking, stuff like that. But it really doesn't have that much of an impact
in the Wealth Management and the Consumer Banking area and that's really what drives the value.
So, for the $700-odd-billion in the Consumer business, which grew checking at 8% year-over-year and that's fairly
consistent with what they've been doing, you remember that's 11 basis point all-in including the interest bearing
part of it which also grew year-over-year. So that's $700 million a year in total interest expense for $700 billion of
deposits. That's what drives the economics, and then Wealth Management and Global Banking also. So, that
doesn't really affect it by all the sort of broad macroeconomic variables.
That's just us doing a great job with consumers, great of customers satisfaction, great product capabilities, great
high touch, high tech and then generating more and more checking accounts while the average balance for
checking account is $7,000 and plus and growing. And that's what's going to drive it. So, I'd say you're absolutely
right. There can be momentary things that would enhance deposit growth in some of the pure institutional
businesses, but it doesn't make much difference to the general US consumer.

Hi, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
A simple question is what is the dollar amount of tech spending and investment spending in 2019? And how does
that compare to last year and this coming one? And the backdrop for that question is, the efficiency – you've
gotten a lot of questions on efficiency on this call and it was worse in the fourth quarter. And your 58% efficiency
for the year is not where some other banks are targeting, like 55%. Now, we know that you're spending a lot of
money. We can see slide 3. You've pointed out that the spending is paying off. So if you could just put a wrap
around the spending and put a number to it, then we, as analysts can figure out, okay, a more core efficiency
level, if you would.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So, one of the things that just in our efficiency ratio compared to other people are 58% for the year, but remember
that we have a lot more Wealth Management at 30%, 28%, 29%, pre-tax margin, i.e., 71% efficiency ratio than
anyone else does. That changes that answer relative to some of the other core banking peers. It's just a bigger,
bigger number because we have the biggest business of $3 trillion and that's just making $1 billion a quarter after-
tax at the best margins, but it's just the sheer mass. So, when you look at it by business unit by business unit, our
efficiency is the top in the class. It's just our mix is different. So, I'll let you figure that out, Mike.
But back to your tech spend, we spent $3 billion, $3.2 billion or $3 billion in 2018, the same in 2019. We have it
scheduled to be the same this year. It's just this constant level of spending. Now, it's different projects every year.
That's pure technology initiatives. You put that on top of the backbone and everything and the number people
could talk about would be higher. But that is just to drive new products and capabilities through the system. And
we aren't changing that because that's what's driving that ability to keep expenses flat.
If you look across the chart Paul showed you when you see 2017, 2018 and 2019 and the expenses per quarter
running $13.1 billion, $13.3 billion et cetera. Think about how much we've done in there in terms of hundreds of
new branches, thousands – 1,300 or complete re-dos, new buildings for our teammates in Wealth Management et
cetera et cetera. And so those are tremendous investment levels that are all in the run rate while we're chopping
away and that's coming from the operational excellence.
So we're spending that much on technology but the question isn't spend, Mike, it's are you getting the usage out
of it? And that's where you got to look at things like the usage of Zelle, which we're growing 80%, 90% a year; the
usage of the CashPro mobile, which grew over 100% a year; the usage, what I talked about in checks written
coming down; what I talked about that we have 4,300 branches, but in there we've actually opened up in new
markets over the last couple years, 15 branches, 20 branches et cetera and continue to do that. So the efficiency

of the rest of the markets funds that, even though your numbers of branches are relatively flattish or coming down
slightly. So it's a complex set of things, but hopefully that gives you some color.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yeah. I guess I'll try one more time since it's not in your tech number like you are expanding to new markets. You
are opening new branches. You are hiring new associates. How much does this investing increase the growth
rate of expenses?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
It's $3.3 billion. So it's in the run rate last year and it will be a like amount this year. Could you take half of that
out? You could. It'd just be not the right thing to do for the company. But it's paid for by the cost takeout it
supports or the mix in how the customer uses, which provides efficiency. So more than 50% of our auto loans are
originated digitally today. I think we did something like $4 billion or $5 billion mortgage originations.
So what we're reaping the benefits of, Mike, three years hence is the investments we made in 2017 as you go into
2020 are produced – for example, digital auto did not exist, and now you're getting 58%. Just think how much
more efficient that process is. Digital mortgages...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Let me just try one more time. This tech spend to run the Bank, change the Bank, I assume you're spending more
to change the bank today versus three or four years ago and that mix goes more towards change the Bank. What
are those figures and where do you think they're headed?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
The $3 billion-plus obviously with Brexit behind us, with a lot of the regulatory environment rules behind us in
terms of implementing the CCAR and the capital rules and a lot of the modeling and you're still spending money
improving that data to make those models work. That's gone. The only thing that works against that is – so yes, if
you thought about how much is going to sort of new business initiatives, the mobile banking feature/ functionality
it's higher in 2020, it was in 2019 and it was in 2018, largely around this issue that you're running off some of
these long-term projects which is good.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2020
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Good morning, Brian. How are you? Brian, can you remind us, you touched on it in some of your comments
already about the number of checks that were processed five years ago versus today. And when you move it from
the paper to the digital, can you remind us what the cost savings are when you do that, per unit?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
So that was going to be checks written by our customers which is this good point because that stops the thing
before it starts. Basically, if you look at deposit which I think is what you're referencing, Gerard, we are now more
mobile than we are at the branches and have been for about five quarters. And the ATMs are still half, the mobile
is a little over, like 27% or something like that, and branches are the rest. So if you think about that, that is $5 in
physical movement, $0.50 and $0.05, $0.50 at the ATM, $0.05 round numbers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. And then moving over to credit, can you guys give us any color? I mean credit is strong across the board
for almost all the banks. Are you guys keeping an eye on any particular sectors within your portfolio? And then as
part of that question, we've sensed from some of your peers that have reported that the corporates or commercial
customers seem to be maybe a little more optimistic in the fourth quarter because of some of these trade issues,
if you could comment on that, if you're seeing that in your customer base as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
I'll take the second half and I'll let Paul. Yes, you're seeing with the – leave aside what happens day-to-day, but
generally the companies are seeing the resolutions emerge for some of these issues. That makes them a little bit
more confident in terms of their activities. We'll hopefully see that in the first half of this year if nothing goes
backwards. The market being up obviously gives people a good feeling.
But one other thing you have to think about is, in the first part of 2019, Gerard, you had your inventory decline, a
recession as people would call it. That went through the system. So you've entered a new place, right? So you
come down, you hit a bottom and then you start to grow out from there. We're kind of in that transition phase. So I
think the combination of the external environment getting the deal of the day with China, obviously is a resolution
of one of the issues that was over people's minds. There are other USMCA, everybody says it's going to be
passed. I think if that got passed, it would be very helpful to people. The fact that people have done what they
needed to do. It was during the year 2019, to change supply chains and think about it. That's disruptive without
endpoint value to the customer, so to speak. And it's like us with Brexit. We spent $400 million-plus money the
customers didn't get better services out of. We just had to create more entities and get them up and running.
Those things are sort of through the system. So I think it's that's what you're feeling is a little bit of a relief on the
other side of that work, which was being done and worry which was being done without a lot of activity. And so
even capital expenditures which grew, grew at a much lower rate off the high in 2018, you're starting – our experts
say will stabilize and kind of come out from there.
And on credit, Paul?

Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Sure. So on credit, I'd start by saying that we are always running through the portfolio routinely analyzing various
sectors, bringing it to senior management, discussing it. So we've got a real great process for always looking for
some risks that are only arising.
As you know, we've been running the company with strong underwriting standards for years now. You see that in
our CCAR results. So I mean I hesitate to sort of pick one sector or another because we notice stuff out in the
marketplace but it may not affect us directly given how we've run the company for years now. But if you're looking
for some sectors that we're paying attention to, not that we think we're overly concerned about them, given how
we've manage the company but we're certainly paying attention to the leveraged loan market, leveraged lending.
We're certainly paying attention to energy with respect to natural gas prices. We're certainly looking at retail with
respect to enclosed malls. We've got our eye on – always have our eye on spots around the world that may be
experiencing a little disruption. So that's how I'd answer that question.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Just a question on the balance sheet and capital. So you're at 11.2%, CET1. Your
stated target has been around 10%. We're still waiting for the SCB finalization. Two questions. So one, any
anticipated changes to where you think your capital goal might be depending on what we get? And then secondly,
have you gotten to a point where you might rethink the mix between your dividend payout which is lower than
peers and the buyback in terms of the mix? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Maybe I'll start on I guess buffers and Brian you might want to pick up on the dividends and buybacks. But look,
today as you point out, we have a meaningful cushion. So it's really not an issue for us right now. In terms of what
our ultimate buffer is going to be when we don't have as much of a cushion, we haven't really talked about that
publicly because we don't think it makes sense today to prejudge what a buffer needs be given the size of the
current cushion and given as you mentioned regulations, SCB, other things are still changing and lots of things
can affect that buffer when we get there. But I would just emphasize we have a sizable buffer right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
In terms of dividend versus buyback, we will keep increasing the dividend as we move up to sort of the 30% level
in earnings payout. We've been clear about that. And then the rest will go into reducing the share count. And if
you look at the page we showed you earlier, part of the issue was the share count was a lot higher than people
expected sort of in the 2009 timeframe after the Merrill transaction.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2020
So, we're pushing that back down and we think that's a good use of our capital. We don't need the capital to fund
the loan growth and deposit growth. You're seeing us able to do that through continuing to fine-tune the balance
sheet. And so, expect us to move the dividend up consistent with what we've done before, assuming CCAR
approval and all that good stuff. But the idea is we'll keep it a level that allows us to use the share buyback to help
drive the EPS growth and you saw the benefits of that year-over-year in an environment where the rate
movements made earnings flatten in the second half of the year. What you saw was the EPS year-over-year was
up double-digits because we can retire the shares. And so, we think that's the best thing to do for the
shareholders.

Operator: We'll take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Hi, Matt.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
I was just wondering if you could talk about the pace of loan growth that you're expecting for 2020, maybe both
kind of within the business lines and then net of some of the drive for runoff and then the drivers of growth and if
that's changing at all versus what it's been the last kind of 6, 12 months. Obviously, commercial industry has
slowed, maybe that's temporary. So, just talk about the pace and drivers of loan growth this year. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Sure. So look, growth in our business segments should continue to be kind of mid-single digits. As you know, we
grew 6% this quarter. Both Consumer and GWIM grew at 7% driven by increased residential mortgage activity.
Global Banking grew 6% year-over-year and that was driven by large corporates, middle market companies,
leasing activity and solid growth in international regions. So, pretty broad-based. We anticipate solid growth in
Consumer loans assuming the current economic environment as well as the sort of pull-through of applications
through the – mortgage applications through the pipeline. With respect to card, we've already talked a little about
that. We expect we can start growing card over time here.
With respect to residential mortgages, originations were strong this quarter. They're up significantly, so, that's
going to translate to solid Q1 growth. However, you have to remember that that's going to be partially offset by
continued runoff of the noncore portfolio. We expect auto growth to be up modestly year-over-year. We expect
solid growth in Small Business. And remember, in all of these categories that I'm talking about, we remain
focused on prime and super prime. And on Commercial loans our outlook remains favorable. Again, growth year-
over-year should be in sort of mid-single digits. So, that's how I'd run through it.

Q4 2019 Earnings Call 15-Jan-2020
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then netting out the kind of mid-single digit growth in the business segments with the runoff, do you
think you can kind of stay in this pace of 4% growth that you saw this quarter as some of the macro holds?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Yes. And if you look at the runoff chart on the loan page there in the right-hand corner you see that we basically
have gotten really to the point where that's now natural runoff. There won't be any sales of major impacts for
purposes that we're doing before to continue to move loans of which we weren't getting income on because of
their status in terms of restructuring and things like that, out and clean the portfolio up. That's just smaller so I
think that helps the overall nominal growth number of the company.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
It's going to be $1.5 billion, $2 billion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Sorry, might be $1.5 billion or $2 billion of loan sale but nothing major is what you're saying?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul M. Donofrio A
Chief Financial Officer, Bank of America Corp.
No, no, not loan sales. The runoff. The runoff is running about $1.5 billion, $2 billion per quarter.

Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, guys. So forgive me for beating a dead horse on the efficiency ratio question. But I guess I'll
ask it in a slightly different way. I mean you guys are out, what, 57%, 58% even with GWIM being a big part of the
overall mix, revenue mix. But if we assume that revenue growth gets back to, say, GDP growth over time, is there
any reason why you couldn't reduce your efficiency ratio below, say, the mid-50s-percent range into the low-50s,

given some of the opportunities you talked about, Brian? And just secular trends towards digitization,
electronification of payments which obviously reduce unit cost pretty materially. It doesn't seem like there's an
obvious reason why you couldn't continue to drive that down pretty materially, even from here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
That's what we're doing. If we keep the expenses flat [indiscernible] (01:17:18) revenue grows GDP plus, that's
200 basis points of operating leverage and that will keep reducing efficiency ratio by definition. So, you're stating
what our job is and we've been able to do it and we'll continue to.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Saul Martinez Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. So, there's no obvious – is there any point at which or any obvious point at which it becomes just much
more difficult? Or is the glide path from here is – just seems like there's nothing really to prevent you from doing
that for a while.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan A

Operator: We have no further questions at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call back to Brian
Moynihan for any closing remarks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian T. Moynihan
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Bank of America Corp.
Well, thank all of you for your attention on the call. We finished another strong year in 2019 for the team and they
did a great job growing the earnings and doing it the right way, making the investments across the franchise. As
we say, it's a nice start. We'll continue to focus on responsible growth. We've got a lot of room to run in this
company. Every business had good client activity, the loan, deposit, underlying customer growth, at the size and
scale of this institution are tremendous work by our teammates and all that helped us provide stable performance
with the rate cut that came through relatively late in the year. So, we feel good about that and we feel good about
working through the other side as Paul described earlier.
We are focused on the cost as many of you asked about but we're focused on continuing to develop and
implement products and services which meet the market's needs and continue to help us grow our market share
across every business at the rate we're doing it, which we think is an opportunity which is ours to continue to take.
Thank you.
