Okay. Thank you, Gigi. We'll start just a minute as we always do with the dashboard. The dashboard is intended
to provide you the best insight possible as to what we at Pinnacle view to be important, what we're managing to.
And the fact that we begin every quarter with the same dashboard at a minimum should showcase our relentless
focus on these critical variables. In short, we're tightly focused on EPS growth and tangible book value per share
accretion, revenue growth and asset quality.
That's what we set aggressive targets for. That's what we persistently talk about in our organization. That's how
both our short and long-term incentives are built. Simply said, thinking about those critical variables that we focus
on, fourth quarter was another fabulous quarter for our firm with very strong core loan growth, core deposit
growth, net interest income growth, fee income growth, year-over-year pre-provision net revenue growth, tangible
book value per share accretion and asset quality metrics.
Beginning with the GAAP metrics, I might focus your attention particularly on the asset quality metrics at the
bottom of the slide. The green bars show the median quarterly performance over the last five years. And as you
can see, our asset quality over the last five years has been very strong. But for all three measures, even with very
strong performance over the last five years, problem loan metrics continue to trend down and are at decade-long
lows.
Moving now to the non-GAAP measures on which I'm most focused, you can see across the top row the
extraordinary growth in revenue and earnings; on the second row, the extraordinary balance sheet growth, which
of course for our firm is our primary mechanism for growing revenue and earnings going forward. And on the far
right of that second row, you can see the reliability of the tangible book value per share accretion. So, for me,
30,000 feet, the conclusion is that we're continuing to execute at a very high level on virtually every critical
success measure for our firm.
Now, I'm going to turn it over to Harold to talk in more depth about our 4Q performance, and then I'll come back
and try to do a little context-setting in terms of where we've been and where we're headed. Harold?

Thanks, Terry. Good morning, everybody. As usual, we will start with loans, and again, the fourth quarter was
another great loan growth quarter for us and provided us with strong momentum as we enter 2022. Excluding
PPP, average loans were up 12.6% annualized between the third and fourth quarter. Overall, loan rates were
down in the fourth quarter due to reduced inflows of PPP on our loan yields.
We recognized $15.5 million in PPP revenues in the fourth quarter, down from $21.2 million in the third quarter.
Due to PPP balances decreasing to approximately $371 million at the end of the fourth quarter, we anticipate PPP
revenues will range between $15 million and $20 million in 2022 compared to approximately $86 million in 2021.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
We've been getting a lot of questions about loan floors and their impact on our yields in a rising rate environment.
I'm not about to apologize for our loan floors, because we enjoyed the ongoing benefit of these floors for quite
some time, but they will cause us to experience some lag on realizing the full benefit of rate hikes in the near-
term.
As the bottom left chart indicates, 62% of our daily float loans will realize the full benefit of rate increases on day
one. That number increases to almost 80% after the first 50 basis points in rate hikes. Like I said, our relationship
managers have done a great job in securing loan floors over the past several years, and it has paid handsome
dividends to us.
Lastly, our market leaders are excited about our loan growth prospects, [ph] and so the (00:06:31) 10% to 15%
growth rate in end-of-period loans inclusive of the remaining PPP forgiveness for 2022 is a reasonable objective
for our firm at this time. In 2021, our new markets including Atlanta and our new specialty lending units provided
approximately $530 million in loan growth. Our view for 2022 is that these markets including Washington, D.C.
and the specialty units should contribute 2 to 3 times that amount in the coming year.
Now to deposits, we had yet another big deposit growth quarter. Core deposits were up almost $2.1 billion in the
fourth quarter. We've experienced significant growth in the noninterest-bearing deposits, ending up at $10.5 billion
at quarter-end, up 41.5% since the end of last year. Our average deposit rates were 14 basis points, while our
end-of-period deposit rates were slightly less at 13 basis points.
Given the current rate outlook, we are likely approaching floors on deposit rates with our primary opportunities in
near-term CD renewals. Helping us will be $1.7 billion in maturing CDs in 2022 with an average rate of
approximately 48 basis points. As to volumes and the projected growth for deposits, the macro environment is
shifting, and thus, we have to believe that deposit growth will eventually find its way back to our traditional growth
strategy with reliance on attracting the best bankers and having them bring their best clients to our firm.
We've never abandoned our long-term view that core deposit growth is a key strategic objective. And even though
the last few years have provided us an ample supply of funding, initially we will need to get back to a more intense
focus on funding our balance sheet growth with core deposits. That said, we like our chances given the significant
investment we've made in relationship managers and new markets over the last few years.
We continue to look at ways to create increased earnings momentum through deployment of excess liquidity into
higher yielding assets and the elimination of wholesale funding sources. We are optimistic that loan growth in
2022 should help to reduce our overall liquidity. But reducing our liquidity to a more normalized level, we believe,
will be a multiyear effort. Our objective here is to find ways to put money to work in a rising rate environment and
not placing too much pressure on tangible book value growth.
During the fourth quarter, our investment securities increased by approximately $446 million, almost 8%. A little
over 80% of our purchases in the fourth quarter were bonds on the short-end of the curve, say, less than three
years with an average rate of approximately 1.15%. We also increased our investment in a collateralized repo
investment by $500 million, which yields approximately 35 basis points.
We are not currently pursuing a formalized strategy to deploy our excess liquidity, which is approximately $3
billion, into longer term investments, even though the 10-year [ph] is pricing at around 1.85% (00:09:23) currently.
We will pick our spots and invest along the curve in a prudent manner. We do believe we have some
4

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
opportunities on the short-end of the curve to put some money to work at slightly higher yield, but this will be a
modest response, say, an additional $500 million in deployment in the first quarter.
As the gray bars on the top left chart reflect, I believe we've done a remarkable job defending our margins over
the last two years. We tend to hover in the 3.25% range and we'll work [ph] hard to thin (00:09:52) our margins
going forward. Obviously, we, like everyone else, look forward to a robust up-rate environment in 2022 as we
think we will win with a rising yield curve. But even if that doesn't materialize, our track record would indicate that
we are very capable of managing our balance sheet regardless of the rate environment.
As to credit, we are again presenting the four big traditional credit metrics of net charge-offs, classified,
nonperformers and past due accruing loans. Pinnacle's loan portfolio continues to perform very well, and again,
these are some of the best credit metrics – ratios we've experienced in our history. Modifications made pursuant
to the Section 4013 of the CARES Act continue to decrease from $817 million at June 30 to $791 million at
September 30 and now stand at $713 million at December 31. Importantly and as noted in the highlights on the
slide, we do anticipate further declines in our allowance for credit losses to total loans ratio over the next several
quarters, given continued improvement in our credit metrics, as well as macroeconomic factors.
Now to fee income, again, lots of good news here, and over the course of 2021, we spent quite a bit of time on
our various fee categories. For the fourth quarter, fee revenues were up more than 20% over the same quarter
last year. As for run rates for 2022, we're anticipating high single to low double-digit increases in fee revenues this
year inclusive of BHG, which we're estimating approximately 20% growth, and we'll speak to that in a few
minutes.
Also included in our planning assertion is that we are not anticipating a repeat of $20 million in income we've
experienced in 2021 from valuation adjustments for several of our joint venture investments. We are planning for
revenues from these investments to be significantly less in 2022. Other than that, our wealth management,
mortgage and other fee-based business lines believe they're ready for a breakout year in 2022.
As to expenses, I was not going to spend a great deal of time on expenses. But given the last slide I
provided, I feel I need to pause here and provide some more color particularly around our expense plan for 2022.
I think everyone is familiar with the impact of incentive cost to our expense base and the direct correlation to
corporate results, more on that in just a second. 2021 was a great year for our associates and to say we are
pleased to deliver an outsized incentive to our associates for their 2021 effort is a profound understatement. We
are elated at being able to provide this to them and thank our board for supporting us in this effort.
As to our overall total expense run rate, we anticipate low double-digit percentage growth in 2022, which is
primarily attributable to head count growth and the new markets. We also are aiming for a recruiting year in 2022
that will be even more prolific than what we experienced in 2021. Terry will discuss more on that in a few minutes.
As to incentives, our current plan is that our incentives will increase by 2% to 3% in 2022 should we achieve our
performance targets. That's right. We hope and desire our incentives to go up in 2022. The increase is based on
head count adds in 2021 and our planned recruiting in 2022. We are reducing our target pay in our annual bonus
plan from the outsized amount of 160% of target back to the traditional 125% of target. But we are also providing
[ph] more cost (00:13:21) to our equity plans for our leadership as well as our associates, who will all receive
some form of stock compensation.
So, why should shareholders be okay with all of this? Substantially, all of our incentive costs are performance-
based. Our annual bonus plan, which is about two-thirds of our annual expense, is entirely performance-based.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
That performance is not based on individual results, but on corporate earnings, PPNR and soundness targets.
Our thesis, our secret sauce is that the right combination for achievement of top-quartile earnings growth and
soundness will result in higher multiples on our shares over time.
This time last year, PNFP Street estimates for 2021 were $4.50 a share. After first quarter 2021 earnings, that
number increased to around $5.20 a share. Internally, we knew those targets would not give us the share
performance we desire. So, our targets were higher, which was basically what we do practically every year. We
finished 2021 at $6.73. So, our targets are set to achieve top-quartile performance over the long-term. If we don't
achieve our targets, then the bonus pools are reduced, and in many years, that number has resulted in 0%
payout. Thus, every year, there is a cushion, and for 2022, [indiscernible] (00:14:43).
We are finalizing our incentive plans for 2022 currently, but nothing of substance will change. Our incentives will
be performance-based and we will target top-quartile performance. My best guess is that given the environment
today and the uncertainties that are still prevalent, we have another meaningful stretch goal in front of us for 2022.
Quickly some comments on capital. The board approved an increase of our dividends per common share to $0.22
from $0.18 yesterday, a 20% increase. During 2021, we redeemed $250 million of sub debt issuances from
available cash. We get calls consistently about issuing new sub debt given interest rates that some of our peers
have been obtaining. But we like our capital stack currently. That said, we will continue to monitor the debt
markets and access them as it appears to be advantageous to us.
And as I have mentioned several times before, and I want to just reinforce the point, we've intensified our focus on
tangible book value growth by adding a peer relative component in our leadership's equity compensation plan. We
are currently calculating the annualized increase of 14.2% in our tangible book value per share at year-end 2021
compared to 2020.
Our equity program plan is designed such that our leadership wins if our tangible book value per share growth,
our return on tangible common equity and our total shareholder return outperforms in relation to our peers. As I
alluded to earlier, we believe our incentive programs are objective, not subjective, and to be candid, very unique
in design and we believe allows our [ph] management with (00:16:22) shareholders to accept rapid shareholder
value creation.
This slide is a summary of our outlook for 2022. We won't go into this slide in depth as we've covered much of this
previously. 2021 was a great year for us and with significant momentum going into 2022, even that excites us
about our growth prospects. Several 2021 matters require a quick highlight as we look forward to 2022. Margins,
we've been very successful on both sides of the balance sheet in keeping our pricing competitive and maintaining
margin. Our rising yield curve will be beneficial to us over time. PPP has been a significant contributor to our
success, both from a client service perspective as well as a financial perspective, but thankfully it is heading to the
rearview mirror.
Replacing the financial impact of PPP is not easy, but we are confident that we have the loan growth prospects to
overcome the reduction in PPP revenues in 2022. Credit has continued to outperform and given where our loan
portfolio is currently positioned and the macro environment, we believe we have reason to be optimistic for 2022.
BHG grew by 46% in 2021. We fully anticipate BHG to have another outstanding year of outperformance at a
pace which should approximate 20% annualized growth. Recruiting, we fully anticipate another great year of
building our core franchise through organic growth by recruiting the best bankers in our markets to our firm. We
will lean into our organic growth model even more in 2022 as we develop our end markets, our specialty lending
businesses and continue to build and grow market share of our legacy franchise.

Now BHG. BHG had another great quarter and one that was better than we anticipated as they wrapped up a
46% growth year. Another quarter of record originations was spread [indiscernible] (00:18:19) through the
pandemic on the gain on sale platform. The bottom-line chart details the almost 1,400 banks in BHG's network
and over 700 individual banks acquired BHG loans last year. Coupled with the securitization success, this
continues to be one of, if not, the strongest lending platform for the gain on sale model in the country.
As to credit, BHG has sold to their network of community and other banks just over $4.1 billion in credit through
their networks. As noted, the recourse obligation is reserved for potential future loss absorption. BHG decreased
recourse observed to approximately $207 million at the end of the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter as a percentage
of loan, it was down by approximately 67 basis points, almost to pre-COVID levels.
As noted on the chart at the bottom right, the trailing 2021 losses landed at 4.64%. This chart splits the actual
credit losses from losses BHG absorbs from reimbursing banks for the unamortized premium the acquiring bank
pay to get the loan. The increase for the prepayment loss is primarily attributable to the fact – the actual premium
paid for BHG credit has gotten larger. Consumer credit trends tend to have a higher prepayment track record and
loans being paid off earlier as rates have decreased. As shown 2.51% in credit losses is very respectable in
comparison to prior years.
As the losses are [ph] vintaged (00:19:48) on the right-hand chart, losses continue to level out in earlier months
as originations thus pointing to a lower loss percentage over the life of the underlying loans. The quality of the
borrowing base in our opinion is very impressive and remains much better than just from a few years ago. BHG
had another great operating quarter, the fourth quarter and exceeded our expectations in the year. 2021 produced
outsized growth in relation to 2020 of 46%. We're also revising our growth factors for 2022 down to approximately
20%. BHG believes that by investing more into the on-balance sheet model and creating a more predictable
revenue stream should benefit the long-term franchise value creation of BHG.
Originations as noted in the previous chart for 2021 approximated $2.8 billion, up meaningfully from 2020. BHG
believes they will continue to grow originations in 2022 and have not reduced their target originations for this year.
Roughly, they're looking at 25% to 30% of growth in originations. They just decided to send more to the balance
sheet. They executed two securitizations in 2021, looking for another one here in the first quarter, and I wouldn't
be surprised if they don't execute three here in 2022.
As the slide indicates they've got more ideas that are in some stage have developed which if successful should
bolster continued growth over the next several years. BHG continues to review their business from both a critical
perspective, how can they perform better, as well as a strategic perspective how can they exploit their strengths
to grow the franchise? Their track record is impressive. So, wrapping up as the loan growth and loan pricing for
Pinnacle in 2022, it will take work, but we are optimistic. Deposit growth has been remarkable, it likely will slow as
macro factors begin to reflect change. Deposit pricing continues to decrease but is nearing [indiscernible]
(00:21:50). Our fee outlook is likely aggressive, but we believe we have the horsepower in place to deliver
outsized growth in 2022. Lastly, we will continue to incent our leadership based on top quartile performance and
believe we have the momentum going into 2022 to do so.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Terry.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
Okay, thank you, Harold. We started this call with a look at our past performance over the last five years on our
credit performance variables that we believe are required to grow shareholder value. We believe our advantaged
markets, our longstanding model for attracting talent, our remarkable ability to wow our clients and most
importantly, our willingness to spend the money necessary to see this extraordinary opportunity should yield best-
in-class growth and has positioned us for the continued share grab that should be available given the stressed
client loyalty for our largest competitors. I think anyone that's following our story for any length of time
understands that our most important competency here is that we can attract many of the best bankers from the
larger banks and enable and empower them to move their client base to Pinnacle, based on the distinctive service
and advice that we're able to offer.
[ph] We're what (00:23:04) frequently referred to as a Goldilocks solution for great bankers. We're just right for the
great bankers and larger banks that are frustrated by the bureaucracy and inability to serve their clients well.
We're small enough to be nimble and responsive to make decisions close to the client, yet big enough to meet the
credit needs of even larger middle market clients and to provide sophisticated treasury management, wealth
management and the like. 2021 was no exception. We set a record for attracting and hiring experienced revenue
producers away from those larger, more vulnerable institutions in our market. And honestly, as Harold's already
indicated, I expect that we'll set another record in 2022.
In a number of our earnings calls I've tried to spent some time helping investors understand the power of our
culture, our differentiated model. And I do that because without understanding that, it's nearly impossible to
understand the pace and reliability of our growth on those key performance variables like EPS, revenue, and
tangible book value. Last quarter, I used a similar chart to this one in order to demonstrate at the firm-wide level,
the linkage between our obsession with the work environment to our obsession with wow-ing our clients, to the
creation of extraordinary shareholder value. As a hope, you know, it's our intent to continue to produce outsized
growth. So, I thought this quarter I'll spent a minute looking at our ability to grow and expand rapidly, largely
because of our culture, not at the expense of our culture.
Many of you will remember our announcement to acquire BNC, which had operations across the Carolinas and
Virginia. At the time it looked to us to be a [indiscernible] (00:24:47) acquisition with both tangible book value
accretion and double-digit EPS accretion. And it enabled us to extend some of the most attractive markets in
Southeast like Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina, and Charleston and Greenville, South Carolina. For those of
you that were around [ph] the end (00:25:03) you remember that we described the deal strategy as number one to
hold on to the growing commercial real estate business, as BNC was so good at. While number two using our
distinctive culture and our C&I focus to bolt-on a large C&I business in order to turbocharge the overall growth
rate. So, this client intended to illustrate the power of our culture to [indiscernible] (00:25:24) markets and produce
higher growth. It all begins with getting the associates fired up and engaged.
As you can see here in 2021, just four years later, we won best place to work awards in Charlotte, in Raleigh, and
in Triad of North Carolina and for the whole state of South Carolina. And according to Greenwich, we've had the
highest Net Promoter Score in North Carolina, so we're able to leverage that obsession with associate
engagement in order to create a distinctive client experience. And then look at the loan growth, particularly the
C&I growth, the [ph] remixing (00:26:02) of the deposit book based on growth in transaction and MMDA accounts,
the fee income growth which has been turbocharged by the introduction of wealth management products
[indiscernible] (00:26:14) and our ability to hire revenue producers from some of the largest and best banks in
those markets.
In fact, we have been able to protect the [indiscernible] (00:26:22) CRE business that Rick Callicutt and his team
have built while transforming the growth engine through the C&I business. I can't say enough about what Rick and
8

his team have accomplished. And while that's past performance, we expect the same cultural for us to produce
outsized growth and our more recent market extensions like Atlanta, Birmingham, Huntsville, and Washington,
D.C.
So, 2021 was a fabulous year for us. Our social engagement is measured through the top [ph] most (00:26:50)
ratings in our annual work environment survey actually increased in 2021, despite a very difficult year in terms of
COVID, social unrest, and so forth. Our Net Promoter Scores reflected improvement in both Tennessee and North
Carolina through our already strong client engagement again, despite COVID, and all its ability to manage service
quality. Most importantly, again, this year, we produced top quartile total shareholder returns with underlying rapid
growth in loans, deposits, fees, EPS, and tangible book value. We've invested meaningfully to position the firm to
continue its rapid growth, with the number of starts in Atlanta, now with 46 associates in two offices, and we're in
the process of building out the third office in [ph] North Fulton County in that market (00:27:36). We're in
Birmingham, Huntsville, and most recently in the Washington, D.C.
And with all the investment in future growth, we continue to balance that with an appropriate spending as
evidenced by our non-interest expense to asset ratio just 1.85% in 2021, which is just another indicator to me in
addition to our sub 50 efficiency ratio that we're rightly investing in growth. In terms of our execution priorities for
this year, Harold has already given you the numbers, but let me sort of give you what's behind it. Number one,
we're continuing to invest meaningfully and exciting and engage in every single associate. As you know, we
already have extraordinary associate engagement. We have it not only across the entire associate base, but
across key minority segments, including racial and gender minorities. But that said, nothing is more important to
us than engage in every single associate such that they can give us their discretionary effort. That's what
accounts for the extraordinary performance that we've had over the last 21 years. But we believe we can do even
better. We have a number of initiatives specifically focused on diversity and inclusion during 2022 to ensure that
we're engaged in every single associate, which is the fuel that drives this engine.
Number two, our second priority is a combined effort not only to drive up our service levels, our Net Promoter
Scores, if you will, but to get paid for it. Somebody might say if you already have the second highest Net Promoter
Scores in the nation, why would you listed as your number two priority to improve them. And the reason is
because, in my opinion, service has suffered dramatically, almost universally, universally in almost every industry.
Many explain the service to management due to COVID. Some blame supply chain issues. In my opinion, one
excuse is as good as another. So, Pinnacle will be doubling down on service quality. We believe now is the time
that we can capitalize on culture and produce even greater differentiation between us and our competitors. And it
is my belief that earning a premium based on the [indiscernible] (00:29:42) service will be particularly critical in
this elevating rate environment and in previous cycles, deposit bases were generally indicative of the pace of
earnings growth, and so using our premium service to minimize the deposit bases as rates rise should enable us
to widen our margins.
Number three, we think about seizing our market share along three dimensions. Number one, continue to hire
great bankers in our existing markets. Number two, extend into new markets [indiscernible] (00:30:10) bank of
consequence. As you know we've recently [ph] gained Atlanta Birmingham Hospital in (00:30:12) Washington,
D.C. Frankly, I'd be surprised if we don't find our way to more of those kinds of opportunities in 2022. And then
thirdly, attract an industry specialist, we use this approach to support our geographic market managers with a
higher level of industry expertise and an ability to attract larger players that might prefer specialized knowledge
versus local context. We've recently added specialists in the area of equipment lending, franchise lending, and
[ph] sovereign (00:30:42) lending to name a few.

So, as I mentioned earlier, we expect all those previous actions to yield outside of growth, and we expect to set
another record in 2022 for recruiting and hiring revenue producers from our larger, more vulnerable competitors.
For – when Harold reviewed our fee growth, you saw that we're currently producing outsized fee growth and a
good number of fee categories like brokerage, like trust, like interchange and so forth. That's what we're talking
about, making sure we meet every need that our clients have. We are specifically not product [ph] pushers
(00:31:17), but it is our desire to know our clients' needs well that we meet them all, which is a huge fee income
opportunity, that's already yielding outsized growth as you've seen, which we expect to continue for the
foreseeable future. And then [indiscernible] (00:31:31) of course even though our asset quality metrics are
extremely strong, nothing can [indiscernible] (00:31:35) earning like credit losses. And so as we grow the firm, we
continue to invest in credit infrastructure including senior credit officers, credit analysts, system support, and so
forth.
As you can probably tell, I'm on fire, but the opportunities that I see for our firm is on fire as I've ever been. We've
built a differentiated model which should continue to produce outsized share growth for an extended period of
time. And honestly, the competitor vulnerability that currently exist should continue to expand in a consolidating
industry, that's just an accelerant for our growth. The banks that have most of the market share in many of our
markets also possess the greatest vulnerability. So, what could be better?
And so, the question is, how do we best see this opportunity? Number one, continuity of senior leadership. Of
course, no one knows the future, but I fully expect all the [indiscernible] (00:32:27) three more years, some more,
I believe some will stay longer. For me [indiscernible] (00:32:34) at least five more years. We can evaluate after
that. Over that period of time, it's my intent to put the board in the best possible position to optimize the
shareholder value. This firm is [indiscernible] (00:32:48) by avoiding consolidation, and it's my intent to continue to
work [indiscernible] (00:32:52) develop the next generation of leaders for the firm. It is best optimized by
combining forces with another financial institution [indiscernible] (00:33:00) one of the most valuable and
attractive franchises around. And the way we do that is to see this opportunity that I've tried to crystalize for you
this morning to be all the dominant Southeastern banking franchise. Operator, we'll stop there and take questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Turner. The floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first
question comes from the line of Jared Shaw from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.

Jared Shaw Q

Hey, everybody, good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Good morning.

Hey, Jared.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Just a few things. I guess on BHG, a couple of questions. Harold, you said the fee income growth to Pinnacle in
that 20% range. But can you reiterate what you think the originations of BHG could be? Did you say that's 25% to
30% growth off of 2021's level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, that's right, Jared. They're thinking they're going to still maintain the same kind of origination momentum
going into 2022 that they thought they've had now for the last few quarters. What they've decided to do is allocate
more to balance sheet and build the balance sheet, create them – create a more sustainable revenue platform
through interest income. So they completed two securitizations in 2021, one in 2020, and they – I think they'll
complete two or three this year. So, and I think they'll be larger than what they've completed in the past. So, they
continue to be on a roll. They continue to find new clients. And so, the business model itself is running really well.
And they've also got these opportunities with these new, call it, verticals that they're also exploring it well. So,
we're still as prompt as we can be about BHG, and think they'll have another great year for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then when we look at that different or that the originations versus placements chart, should we assuming that
the placements are still you know call it around that $400 million level, that they are still going to keep that
demand satisfied there with the growth coming beyond that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think they will continue kind of a similar ratio to what they did in the fourth quarter. So, as they scale out
2022, they'll manage their results towards that 20% growth there.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. I guess shifting to the broader loan growth. Terry, you know that was great, great data on the $530 million
of growth in the new markets. You know when you add in D.C. like you said for 2022 and looking to see that
expand, do you think that the D.C. operation can ramp up maybe faster than that typical. And I guess what did
you say in the past takes about three years to get a book of business or do you think that that could ramp faster
than what you've seen for other team hires?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I do for two reasons. I think that the [ph] thrust (00:36:37) there will have an even more commercial orientation
than our other market extensions. And so, it takes less people to produce more loan volume than what would be
difficult. And so, not only size and growth dynamics of the market, but particularly, the group of people that we've
hired. I mean you know my guess is that we could do somewhere between $50 million and $100 million in our first
quarter out of the gate. And so, again [indiscernible] (00:37:07) in the first quarter, the momentum builds as you
go, we could do something really special there. And you know [indiscernible] (00:37:14), you didn't ask about it
[indiscernible] (00:37:15), but I might just comment on it [indiscernible] (00:37:18). I think in round numbers they
finished this year with about $900 million in loan commitments, about $500 million in loan outstandings. They've
got 46 associates. As I mentioned, they're going into their third office and so, I mean I think it's traveling really fast
as well. So, I don't look for Atlanta and D.C. to produce really outsized growth.
And then I always want to make sure people get it. These markets that we're in, like Charlotte and Raleigh, while
the asset bases that we have there are meaningful to us, they're in that competitive market capacity what I expect
to grow there, just, again, I mentioned, all hiring that's done and the movement towards the C&I mix over there,
we expect Charlotte and Raleigh to really produce some extraordinary growth as well. So, anyway, that's a little
more [ph] gas (00:38:10), but...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
That's great color. Thanks. And then I guess just [ph] finally you have, I think (00:38:14), with all the success
you've had in hiring and how quickly they're able to come in and all the benefits you talked about. Do you really
even need to consider M&A at this point in terms of [indiscernible] (00:38:25) acquired to get into these markets?
Or do you think you've – you sort of cracked the code here and can just do hiring is the – is really the sole way to
expand the potential?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, Jared, as you know, I have worked hard to try to make sure people get it. I'm not going to take the M&A off
the table, because there could be a great transaction that I'd be willing to do. But that said, if you want my honest
opinion, you're on the right track, it's sort of like, why would I go do some acquisition when you can produce kind
of growth in Atlanta and D.C. and Birmingham, and again, I think we'll have other opportunities like those that's
easily [indiscernible] (00:39:12).

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan. Your line is

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, good morning, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Hey, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I would like to start, so to go back to BHG for a minute and the reduction – the fee income growth of 30% down to
20%. Can you give us a little more context what drove their decision? And maybe was it a change in the rate
outlook and maybe that they're expecting maybe that gain on sale margin to compress a bit?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, I think the rate outlook did have something to do with it, but I really think that the CEO strongly believes that
the on-balance sheet model will result in a greater franchise value for Al. So, I think as he begins to look you know
over the next two, three or four years, and we agree with Al, on that point. As he looks over the next two or three
or four years, I think he's going to be extremely focused on how to build a franchise value of that firm. And I think
this is one of his kind of core beliefs. He felt like going into 2021 that they were going to have a great year, which
they achieved. They felt like that you know 2022 would get a spillover of that at a 30% kind of clip. But I think here
over the last quarter or so, he has reevaluated that, that – call it that allocation between balance sheet and gain
on sale. And just kind of moved it around a little bit, I think is kind of the perspective that he shared with us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Okay. That's helpful. Terry, in terms of new hires, so you guys hired 119 revenue producers in 2021. And
last quarter, I thought you indicated you thought you might be 110, 120 for 2022. Are you still in that range? Like,
how are you thinking and what's embedded in the expense guidance?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I'll say in terms of the hires, I think we'll do more than that, that's a reasonable range, but I think we'll do more
than that. And again, my optimism is really fueled by what is happening in Atlanta. Talk about that a little bit.
Honestly, I believe they have three commitment letters for meaningful revenue producers that are signed and
awaiting their balance before they come across. And so again, I expect to come out of the gate a little quicker in
Atlanta, and I think the same thing will happen in D.C. So a little more optimistic view, I'm not trying to take the
13

guidance up meaningfully, but I expect we'll hire more than what I previously said. Harold, do you want to talk
about how that's taken into account in the expense guide?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, we've loaded everything into the expense book for 2022. We've got less of a turnover factor. I'll say it that
way. So, we expect our head count to increase more in 2022 than in 2021. The hiring just sheer hires we believe
will increase. I think the numbers like 10% or 15%, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And maybe final, just drilling down a bit, Harold. How much of the bump up? I know it's fairly modest, but
the bump up in expense outlook, how much of that tied to this wage pressure that we're hearing is basically
everywhere? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I'll – we believe well, first of all, the standard rate for our firm was about 3%. I think we ended up close to 4%, with
all the merit raises that are going into play this year. So yes, we're feeling it, but I don't think it's going to derail this
plan. I think congratulations to the Fed for realizing there is inflation though.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2022
Yeah, we think, well, first of all, there's likely some seasonality around interchange because of December, but we
don't think we'll see any significant pullback in any of those areas going into next year. A lot of the wealth
management is due to what's going on in overall or in the broader markets. But I don't think there's any big
pullbacks that we're looking at going into the first quarter, other than like I mentioned probably in the service
charge and interchange areas, where there is just probably less volume going into the first quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Okay. And...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
And Jennifer, if I could just say that, you're getting extraordinary growth in these wealth management businesses,
particularly the brokerage business, the trust business and so forth, and so much of that are tied to this revenue
producing thing that we talk about and try to be clear, it's not just relationship managers, it is the wealth managers
and brokers and those kinds of people. And so we have hired a great number of those kinds of folks, particularly
in our Carolina's markets. And so, that's really fueling a lot of that growth there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jennifer Demba Q

Terry, when can we expect Pinnacle to enter the Sunshine State?

[indiscernible] (00:45:59).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
...I thought we were headquartered in [indiscernible] (00:46:01). You know I don't know the answer to that. And,
you know this, we don't set targets saying, hey, I've got to get to this market by this day, it's all about the
opportunity. But I can – I don't mind to say we banged around with some groups. We ultimately decided we didn't
think they were the right things for us. And as you know, they would have been good salespeople, but we didn't
believe they could build a consequential bank for us. So, anyway, I'd just indicate that we're interested in some of
those markets and I would be [indiscernible] (00:46:38) if we don't find our way there over the reasonably near
future. But again, I don't have a specific date or a specific target to get there is just about when we find the right
group.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brock Vandervliet from UBS. Your line is now
open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Harold, is that with your deposit growth, it's not too much different
than many of the banks in the sector where it's up roughly a third or so since COVID started. You kind of get out
the telescope and think about deposit betas and such. How should we start to think about the stickiness, I guess,
for lack of a more technical term of those deposit balances as rates begin to move.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, that's a great question, Brock. We've been looking at growth in depositors, particularly large deposit
balances for quite some time, trying to anticipate what could happen in an upright environment. That said, the
relationship managers that we talked to about those depositors believe they're sticky. There will – there are some
– there is some money in all of that where they're waiting on an event to occur or something like that. But that just
happens in the day to day running of this bank. So, we believe they're sticky. As the [ph] datas (00:48:18) and
what we're projecting, we're looking at somewhere in the numbers around 40%. That was similar to the last cycle,
40% to 60%, dependent on whether or not you're talking total deposits or interest-bearing deposits. But it's –
we're looking forward to that occurring. We're coaching the sales force on an operating environment now. I think
Rob McCabe, Rick Callicutt, and Rob Garcia in Atlanta, they're all getting ready for upright environments and
talking to their, call it their relationship managers that work with large depositors on how we're going to respond to
that. So, we're just hopeful. We believe that more sooner than later, rate increase from the Fed is going to be
helpful to all of us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And flipping over to the other side of the balance sheet and securities. It – I think it added $446
million this quarter. It's been pretty steady. It doesn't – and I think you mentioned $500 million for Q1. It doesn't
sound like you're likely to accelerate that, just given that rates are up and you can earn more on that, the book
value focus seems to be playing into that. I just want to make sure I've got that correct.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah, I think you've got that correct. We'll pick our spots. If I had to say we had a target yield bogey with the bond
book, our new purchases is probably in the 250 range, maybe a little bit north of that with the same kind of
products that we've customarily acquired. So, that's probably where we're headed. We're likely to put some more
work – more money to work on the shorter end of the curve. We got a couple of products that we're looking at that
we think we're going to be able to execute on here in the first quarter and through the second quarter. But like you
might imagine, they won't move the needle a lot.

Hi. Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Maybe just sticking with the balance sheet composition as a follow-up to Brock's question. So, if we think about
the – maybe the size of the securities book, it feels like we're not going to see a big change [ph] from the
(00:50:52) 17% of average earning assets today, maybe up a little bit to 18% to 19%. But [ph] my gut is that it
(00:50:57) stays kind of below 20% of the balance sheet. And then, as a follow-on to that, on the liquidity side, as
you think about this mid double-digit growth in your GAAP NII, what kind of – how much of deployment from this
$4 billion in cash are you assuming kind of goes away and is deployed into [ph] one of the securities books
(00:51:21)? Just trying to think of the kind of size of the balance sheet within that GAAP NII guide.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. [indiscernible] (00:51:28). Right now, we believe we've got about $3 billion in cash that's just – that we wish
was deployed in a higher yielding asset, but hasn't pulled the trigger on because of the way the rate market is
responding currently, so on and so forth. I think you're accurate in your 18%, 20% kind of range. I don't think we'll
– we're not going to execute any big [ph] gulp (00:51:50) kind of strategy to divest – or to reduce the liquidity
profile into more longer term bond assets.
But we will monitor what's going on every day. The 10-years kind of spiked up. Not sure what it's going to do
today. But it does make things more interesting. We kind of like bonds that, call them, five, seven, eight years in
maturity that we can get, call it, 2.50% or more in yield. If we can find those bonds, then we'll tap into the market
in a very measured and modest way. But you're right, there's not like any kind of ultimatum put on my group to
say let's go push all these – all this money out into the bond market. That's not happening.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Catherine Mealor Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. So, then really this $3 billion in cash is going to be mostly going into the loan book. So, to your point, in that
it's a multiyear effort, maybe at the most $1 billion of that is deployed – kind of comes out this year, just really
depending on how deposit growth flows?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
That's right. And deposit growth is probably one of the more – the biggest uncertainties as to what happens with
the macro environment changing like it's going to change and how all that flows down to banks like us.

Okay, all right. And then, one last just on BHG, and you touched on this a little bit earlier. But how does a higher

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Well, they probably – they would tell you that they're not going to shrink, but they've widened throughout the
pandemic. So, we've been in this low rate environment now for several years and spreads have widened. So, I'm
not sure they're going to get any wider when we get to an up-rate environment. So – but where they might be like
10% kind of spreads, they might go to 9%. It's not going to be a big change if rates move north quickly.

M. Terry Turner A

Hey, Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
I'm just curious, just maybe to continue on the BHG path there, it looks like in the third quarter, you guys put on
about $75 million on your own balance sheet of BHG loans and that's about $263 million now in total. So, just kind
of wondering what – if you have the fourth quarter number or kind of how much is baked into the growth
expectations for 2022 in terms of how much of that you guys will hold yourselves on balance sheet.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
I think we're kind of in a $50 million range in the fourth quarter. And for the year, I think our planning assumption is
that we're – we'll be less in 2022 than 2021, call it around $150 million to $200 million.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, great. That's helpful. And then, the...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
[indiscernible] (00:55:58) Catherine's question about spreads, the one thing that I think is an advantage to BHG is
the funding platform through that auction network, for that spread to shrink, the BHG loans have to compete with
a more accelerating lending platform at some of these smaller, call it, community banks. And so, right now, BHG
represents to the smaller community banks an opportunity to grow their loan platform that they don't otherwise
have. So, for spreads to shrink, their loan growth outlook has to improve. And it may improve, but we don't think
it's going to improve significantly to a point that spreads are going to be impacted materially. How about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. That's good color. Okay, thanks. And then, maybe thinking about the interchange fees for a second, I know
you had some vendor incentives last quarter that maybe – that was going to come out. But then, obviously, you
still had a big quarter here. I guess I'm wondering, was there anything unusual that led other than – you
mentioned the month of December being active, but anything unusual that led that number higher? And then,
we've seen with some of the larger regional banks the push-back on overdraft fees. Are you guys experiencing
any of that at your size bank or do you think that will be a pressure point for you guys here in the quarters ahead?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I don't know of anything unusual in the fourth quarter interchange numbers. We're not feeling the pressure
on overdrafts. We had a lot of waivers during COVID. We pulled back on some of that post-COVID. And so, we
19

believe we're at somewhat of a standard run rate. We monitor what's going on with the large caps and what
they're doing with overdraft waiver and so on and so forth. We'll just have to see how all that plays out and how it
works its way down to us over the coming quarters and years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stephen Kendall Scouten Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. Okay. And then, maybe last thing for me. I'm just kind of curious around asset sensitivity. It's increased
modestly, I guess, over the last four quarters. Harold, you noted the floors and that those have been a great
benefit to you guys. But is there anything you guys are thinking about strategically to increase the rate sensitivity
more materially? And then, the 58% deposit beta, I think you mentioned in the presentation and 40% overall, why
wouldn't it be lower this cycle given all the liquidity we have? Can you kind of give me your thoughts there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. That would be absolutely where we're headed. And that's what brings in this whole coaching thing that Rob
and Rob and Rick are doing with their sales force and getting them prepared for a rising rate environment. So, we
hope we can beat the betas that we've kind of set out there and believe we have a great opportunity to do it
precisely because we have the liquidity out in the system and so does everybody else. So, I don't think – from the
large caps and the mid-caps, you'll see a significant boost in deposit rates from right out of the gate. So, we will
try to manage that accordingly.
As to boosting asset sensitivity kind of here in the near-term, I think it's going to be through our loan book. I think
loan funding has traditionally come to us with a heavier weight on floating rate assets. I think we'll still have some
deposit gathering going on here that'll likely go into cash. So, I think we've got a great opportunity here in the
near-term to still boost our asset sensitivity levels by some amount. That said, over the long-term, I think it's
important to get on the table. Our goal is to be neutral with some bias one way or the other based on what we
think the near-term prospects are. But we will not bet heavily one way or the other with our balance sheet.

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to go back to BHG again, another big
recourse reserve release this quarter. I think you had said on the last call that you expected it to end the year
around 5.25%. You're at 5%. They talked about getting down to 4.75% to 4.85% this year. Any updates there?
And then, if you can comment on the expense trajectory there, because it did look like another big ramp in
20

expense growth there, and just maybe if that incorporates any new verticals that were talked about at the Investor
Day? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think there is probably some room – more room in recourse reserve release here in 2022. I'm not sure if
they'll tap into it. But I think that 4.75% number is still kind of reasonable. I don't know if it'll get that low, but that's
kind of what their current thoughts are. Their expense growth, they are adding quite a bit of head count with –
particularly in their analytical groups. They believe that's kind of the – what drives the engine. So, they are seeing
quite a bit of that as well. But we still believe, at the end of the day, we're looking at 20% growth for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then, maybe just back to market expansions, you guys have had a very successful track
record. I have no doubt that you will be successful in the D.C. market as well. Florida was brought up earlier. But
as you look throughout the Southeast and then the Southwest, Texas is obviously a market that would seem to
kind of fit the profile that you guys have historically sought. Would that be an option at some point and maybe if
you can just remind us on where the geographic limitations might be in the – kind of the short to intermediate
term? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think on what our geographic thrust is, we call it the Southeast. Basically, what we're trying to say is
Memphis, draw a line up to D.C. and down to the southern tip of Florida, that's sort of the target. Again, we have –
we now have the [ph] SEC (01:02:34) participants from Texas. So, I guess somebody might call Texas a
Southeastern state. But right now, our thrust is there. Candidly, the reason that our thrust is there is we know the
bankers and the bankers that we've hired are bankers in those markets, and that's really what we do is try to
cultivate our known bankers. We know less in Texas, and therefore, the opportunities are smaller for us. I think
you're on the right point. It wouldn't surprise me if we draw the map at some point to include Texas. But right now,
the opportunities are so rich in the Southeastern markets. That's our first preference.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
All right. Well, maybe at some point, Harold can stir up the LA office too as you guys [ph] grow it (01:03:22).

David J. Bishop Q
Analyst, Seaport Research Partners
Hey. Good morning, gentlemen.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Bishop Q
Analyst, Seaport Research Partners
Hey, a quick question, Terry and Harold. Noticed the nice improvement, nice growth on the C&I, commercial and
industrial segment there. Just curious maybe what you're seeing and hearing on that front. Are you seeing any
sort of better line utilization up there? And obviously, the Omicron virus has dominated the news. But I noted the
narrative in terms of the credit costs. It sounds like you're expecting a further reduction in the allowance here. Is
that sort of informing your view on the positive economic outlook? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
M. Terry Turner A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think in terms of C&I loan demand, I honestly believe C&I loan demand is fairly tepid. We don't see a
meaningful increase in line utilization at this point. And I think, again, we deal with owner-managed businesses,
lower mid-market businesses. I think a lot of people are just sort of looking at the landscape saying, boy, there are
a lot of unknowns here, and typically, they don't do a lot of borrowing when there are so many unknowns.
So, I think if we can get a more solid footing for both the economy and the political landscape and all those kind of
things that influence optimism among business owners, that will be helpful and additive and produce greater loan
demand. But I do think C&I loan demand is not very strong. The growth that we achieve there, I think, is largely
dependent on our hiring model and the number of new hires that we've made and moving their books of business
and so forth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Bishop Q
Analyst, Seaport Research Partners
Got it. And then, just maybe a follow-up on the asset sensitivity and net interest margin. I think last quarter, you
said the core NIM outlook a little lower in the near-term, not materially down, flat to a few basis points, which
came to fruition this quarter. [ph] I think it was down 1 basis point (01:05:38). Looking in your crystal ball and just
first quarter 2022, what are you thinking now in terms of the core margin direction?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think we'll still experience some dilution in our margins. But again, I don't think it's going to be a big thing. I
think it'll come down maybe a few basis points, but nothing significant.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Bishop Q
Analyst, Seaport Research Partners

is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Martin Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. The – hey, Harold, maybe just one follow-up on the
last question on margin with regard to your guide and NII. The core margin, like in your outlook, when you kind of
look at the core margin, what do you consider the core margin today? I guess knowing with the liquidity levels,
PPP, I'm just wondering what you pull out of there when you're thinking about the core margin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Harold R. Carpenter A
Chief Financial Officer, Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.
Yeah. I think you're right. That's a valid question. But [ph] we're still analyzing the (01:06:43) impact of this liquidity
build. It has very little impact on net interest income, but a meaningful impact on net interest margin. So, I think it's
important to understand that. As to the PPP program, we think the PPP program is effectively in the rearview
mirror. And so, it'll be less impactful for sure. We'll have to probably keep looking at it as well for comparison
purposes to the last couple of years. And as far as discount accretion on mergers, that number has come down
quite a bit. And so, the GAAP margin and our core margin, the biggest difference is basically going to be with
respect to the liquidity and that number.
