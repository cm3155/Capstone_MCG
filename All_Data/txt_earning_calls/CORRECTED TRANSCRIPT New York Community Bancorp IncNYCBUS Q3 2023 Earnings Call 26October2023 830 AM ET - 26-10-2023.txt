Thomas Robert Cangemi
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Sal. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Earlier this month, we announced
solid operating results for the third quarter of the year. Our performance reflects our ongoing diversification efforts
on both sides of the balance sheet, arising from the combination of three legacy banks.
Among this quarter's highlights was good linked-quarter loan growth, stable deposit trends and a significantly
higher net interest margin. We also made further progress in improving our funding mix, as both wholesale
borrowings and brokered CDs declined, while noninterest bearing deposits remain approximately one-third of total
deposits, virtually unchanged from the previous quarter.
From a net income and earnings perspective, we reported net income available to common stockholders of $266
million or $0.36 per diluted share as adjusted [ph] for (00:02:34) merger-related expenses. Our EPS this quarter
was $0.02 better than consensus. One of the drivers this quarter was a much higher net interest margin. The NIM
came in at 3.27%, up 6 basis points compared to the prior quarter and well ahead of our guidance range of 2.95%
to 3.05%. The increase was driven by higher asset yields as we continue to benefit from the higher interest rate
environment and a higher average balance of non-interest-bearing deposits compared to last quarter.
We remain constructive on the net interest margin going forward, due to the continuing positive shift in our funding
mix and the impact of higher asset yields. Another driver was our loan growth. Total loans during the third quarter

were up modestly, as growth in the C&I portfolio led by our specialty finance businesses and in homebuilder
finance, offset declines in other businesses. Overall, the loan portfolio ended the quarter at $84 billion, up over
$700 million or 1% compared to the prior quarter. At September 30, total commercial loans represented 45% of
total loans, reflecting a significant diversification compared to where we stood a year ago.
Turning now to deposits. Our deposit trends in the third quarter were relatively stable. Total deposits were $82.7
billion, $5.8 billion lower compared to the $88.5 billion at June 30. The majority of the decline was due to a $4
billion decrease in custodial deposits related to the Signature transaction, which totaled $2 billion at the end of the
quarter compared to $6 billion last quarter. In addition, brokered deposits declined $1.2 billion to $8.1 billion
compared to the previous quarter. Excluding these two items, deposits were down less than 1% on a linked
quarter basis.
Additionally, our funding mix continues to improve as wholesale borrowings declined 12% compared to the
previous quarter. Overall, they are down 33% or nearly $7 billion since yearend 2022. In the fourth quarter, we
had approximately $3.1 billion of wholesale bonds at a weighted average rate of 4.03% that either a maturing or
can be [ph] called (00:04:42) by the FHLB.
Turning now to asset quality. While early stage delinquency declined significantly, total non-performing loans
increased $159 million or 68% to [ph] $319 million (00:04:54) compared to the prior quarter due to the increase in
the CRE portfolio. More specifically, the increase was related to two office-related loans, one of which was in
Syracuse, New York, totalling $28 million, and the other in Manhattan totaling $112 million. Despite the increase
in NPLs, our asset quality metrics remain strong as NPLs to total loans were 47 basis points compared to 28
basis points last quarter, while our net charge-offs were also up or near 3 basis points as average loans.
Also, as you can see on slide 9 to 12 in our investor presentation material, our asset quality metrics remains solid
and continues to rank among the best relative to the industry in our peers. The strong metrics reflect our
conservative underwriting standards, which have served us well over multiple business cycles.
Turning now to our guidance for the fourth quarter. We expect the NIM in the range of 3% to 3.10%, mortgage
gain on sale of $16 million to $20 million, and net return on MSR assets of 8% to 10%. Loan admin income of $15
million, annualized operating expense range of $2 billion to $2.1 billion, and a full year tax rate of 23%. Also,
during the quarter, we unveiled our modern new brand and logo combining the best elements of all three legacy
banks.
Our teammates are excited about this new branding and I'm excited as well. Even though it will be a new logo and
a brand, the meaning behind it does not change. We remain committed to helping our customers and teammates
thrive as we move to one bank, one brand, one culture as the new Flagstar.
Finally, I would like to say a special thank you to all of our teammates. Our results would not be possible without
their dedication and commitment to our client and our customers. With that, we would be happy to answer any
questions you may have. We'll do our very best to get all of you within the time remaining. But if we don't, please
feel free to call us later today or during the week.
Operator, please open the line for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of David Rochester with Compass
Point. Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Dave.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Hey, good morning, guys. Just on the margin guide, what's your assumption for custodial deposits baked into
that? And what does the average balance for those in the quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Right. So the big move is we talked about last quarter on the custodial deposits is really coming from the fund
banking loans. They're the ones that are paying down pretty quickly. So those are the deposits that we're holding.
As you may know, the FDIC has announced the sale of that portfolio. So that will transfer at the end of this month,
so in the next couple of days. So we're going to see that number drop dramatically when we hit November 1,
because the rest of the custodial deposits will be related to the multi-family and the CRE loans and those
paydowns are significantly less than on the fund banking side. So the average balance is around $4 billion for the
quarter, $2 billion at the end of the quarter, and then dropped dramatically once we get into November.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
So this margin guide really doesn't include much in the way of custodial deposits remaining?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
That's correct.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Hey. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Ebrahim. How are you?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good. So, Tom, maybe just start on asset quality means, again, you had pristine track record on asset quality.
When we think about, one, just address like the office portfolio, your expectation around the lost content for your
book relative to what we hear from the industry, how well-deserved your community is for that book. And then,
secondly, also talk about the health of the multi-family landlords in New York. Like, you're hearing a lot more
concern around the rent regulation limiting the ability to raise rents and that's going to squeeze these – the
landlords. So, if you can address the office and the health of the multi-family landlords?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I'll start with the latter first. So, obviously, the marketplace has changed significantly since the rent laws back in
2018 had changed. And we've been monitoring that very carefully. We've seen some significant success with our
client book. Given the fact that we have a long history, these are in-place families that have been doing this for
multiple decades, very [ph] confident in their (00:09:23) long-term business strategies. But they do a very strong
job of managing their book of business and the generational business for the most part.
With that being said, we have a very strong portfolio with low LTVs and we monitor it carefully and we're seeing
consistencies of payment, we're seeing the reaction to higher interest rates on the reset either SOFR option or a
fixed rate option, then having the capacity and the ability to continue to pay, and that's what we're seeing. So
we're not seeing any delinquency trends of any material at all in the multi-family space, which is a positive. Again,
rates have significantly risen over the past year or so and it does have an impact to the cash flow, but these are
well in tune, operators have been able to manage through that. But the reality of the activity has been very slow.
We haven't seen much activity at all, I would say since I've been here, this is my 26th, 27 year, going to my 27th
year now at the bank, this is the slowest activity I've ever seen when it comes to property transactions, the interest
as far as buying and selling. So it really is a relatively static or no activity whatsoever, and we'll monitor that very
carefully.
At the same time, rents are up to the highest point in the City of New York. So we're getting very strong rentals
and they're managing through an inflationary environment. So, we're very positive with respect to our portfolio.
But there's no question that [indiscernible] (00:10:39) changes had an impact and the activity of taking the units to
a free market unit has its different business model, and our team is monitoring the statistics as far as how that
impacts valuation, how it impacts overall cap rates, and it's been relatively stable even despite the significant rise
in interest rates.
In respect to the overall CRE portfolio, we have about $3.4 billion in total CRE, and about $1.5 billion
[indiscernible] (00:11:09) that's in Manhattan.

John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
$1.8 billion.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
About $1.8 billion in Manhattan. This is one specific loan in the Manhattan portfolio. I believe it's like an A- type of
credit. We're confident that we have value there, so there was no – I don't think there was a related charge-off to
that particular credit, but it's one loan. So, we have a very strong portfolio. We have statistics that we put out in
our slide presentation material. It was very clear on the overall strength of the portfolio, relatively low LTVs, strong
debt service coverage ratios, very strong sponsorships, but it's not a trend and we're monitoring it. No question
rates are much higher. We're still coming out of the pandemic. We're evaluating overall square footage in rentals
and as far as leases coming due and exits of certain large clientele. But it's been a relatively stable scenario. And
despite the negativity you're reading about, our portfolio is performing extremely well relevant to the marketplace.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's helpful. And maybe just one other one on expenses. I think in the past you've said you expect expenses to
stay flat next year versus this year. One, remind us in terms of where we are in realizing saving side to both the
acquisitions, how much more to go? And do you still feel good about expenses staying flat? It feels like you're
making a lot of investments. There's a lot going on at the bank. So I would appreciate an update there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So I'll start and pass the baton to John. The big picture is that I don't – our guide is pretty much the same it was
last quarter for 2023.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
...and we haven't given our 2024 guidance. And clearly, we are investing, as you indicated, into the infrastructure
to build out past the $100 billion now. We understand our obligations there. So we clearly are focusing on making
this company at the point of the $100 billion process to ensure that we have all of the requisite infrastructure. And
we spent a lot of money over the years to get this. So we understand the path there. At the same time, we're also
investing into the market regarding our new partner with the Signature transaction. So we are adding talent to the
pools of additional PCG team that also adds to the expense base. That's where you sort of ramp up in the second
and third quarter. But the reality is that we have a very strong focus here to make sure that we have a history. And
this is just a history of managing a very strong efficiency ratio, but also being cognizant of our obligations as a
$100 billion plus institution.
With that, I'll pass it to John.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. We haven't given specific guidance yet for 2024, but how we've talked about it is that there are both
headwinds and tailwinds into 2024 when you compare it to 2023. As Tom mentioned, we definitely have some
additional adds, both back office and through our PCG groups that are going to put pressure on the expense base
going up along with just the additional expenses for being over $100 billion.
And then the tailwinds of the system's conversions which we have the Flagstar systems conversion scheduled in
the first quarter. So we'll start to see some benefits from that. And then, we have the Signature conversion after
that. So those benefits will be later, towards the later end of the year. So that's kind of how we think about 2024
right now, but we'll give our guidance at the next quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Ebrahim, the only thing I'll add to John's comments, we're still unwinding the legacy Signature portfolio that we
don't own. So we do have costs associated with that that will be impacted favorably assuming that those assets
do plot the institution go elsewhere. So that's also – that also be impacted into next year as well assuming that...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. That's right. The FDIC has put out the MF and CRE portfolios for sale. We expect bids to be this quarter,
and we'll see what happens when that comes to pass.

Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris McGratty with KBW. Please go ahead.

Good morning, Chris.

Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. John, maybe just a question on the balance sheet to start, a lot of movements with the
deposits that you telegraphed. But can you help us with just overall size of earning assets near term, targeted
cash levels you're building the bond book? Just help on the moving pieces for the next couple of quarters?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Sure. Yeah. No. No problem. We have slowly started to build the securities portfolio, really just a liquidity shift
between cash and securities, government securities, very liquid, just to try to monetize some asset sensitivity here
and get closer to neutral. That's been our plan back since March 31 to get closer to neutral. And we have each
quarter. We're slightly asset sensitive right now and that'll continue to trend towards neutrality here in the next

quarter or so. So I think when you look at where we are in interest earning assets, the declines have basically
stopped from the cash side. This is about where we'll be within $1 billion or so from a cash and securities
perspective. So you may see cash drop a little bit, but that would be offset by incremental purchases on the
security side.
So I'd say that the large drops are behind us on the cash and the liquidity front, right? We've paid down a lot of
debt on the wholesale side and some brokerage side. That'll be more limited going forward. And then we'll look to
grow certain areas of the loan portfolio where it makes sense strategically for the company where we have the
best opportunity to bring in deposits related to those loans. So I would say, very limited change from the – if you
look at cash and securities combined going forward and then some – hopefully, some small growth on the loan
side where it makes sense strategically.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Just if can follow up, the – you had $107 million of earning assets in the quarter. Obviously, timing of
everything is related when you move stuff during the quarter. But just zeroing in on that fourth quarter earning
assets, it feels like it's going to be lower than those $107 million. But just any kind of fine-tuning [indiscernible]
(00:16:56)?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, but it's not – yeah, not significantly lower than the $107 million. We expect it to be right around that number,
because I really don't see us dropping much more on the securities in total in the cash side. So I expect that'll be
pretty stable here. And hopefully we'll be able to build that as our success on the deposit side starts to come
through.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then maybe just the last one on the loan and deposit, you retooled that a bit. How are you thinking
about that entering 2024 is little high?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, Chris, it's Tom. I would say that the strategy going forward here is relationship deposit story and all lines of
the businesses, right? We're a different company. We're focusing on new Flagstar. We're focusing on getting
ourselves to a commercial banking standard. We recognize that historically we've had a very high loan to deposit
ratio as a traditional thrift model. That's history. The goal here is to right-size institutions to be more in line to
commercial banking model. We had the Flagstar transaction and we had the opportunity to be participating in a
receivership transaction which really changed the model in respect to the funding mix. So the goal here is to bring
that level inside of 100. That's the goal here and continuing to focus on best practices in the industry. And that's a
more commercial bank model.
So I'm proud of the opportunity to diversify our lines and focus on the positive relationship lending. If there's no
deposit on the relationship, we'll probably not going to make the loan. It's just that that's coming from the top of
the house at the board level. It's very focused there that this is a great opportunity to take these three institutions
under the new Flagstar umbrella and focus on relationship banking. We see it transforming actively on the multi-

family CRE side. Throughout the past few years, we've had tremendous success with that model, and that's going
to be filtered to all of the lines of businesses. That's going to be the strategy going forward.

Yeah. Hi. Good morning. So we've hired in total now 59 group directors and 105 support staff. So, there was
tremendous opportunity over the last couple of quarters to hire. We're very excited about the team members that
we've brought on board. And this is truly a tremendous opportunity to fill a massive void in the marketplace for
service-oriented institutions. And we're really happy with the talent that we brought on board in order to do that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I'll just add a point to that. The stability of the legacy Signature teams are solid. We had tremendous strength
throughout the summer on stabilizing the team. That was the business risk when we announced the transaction.
So there's been stability and, as [ph] Eric (00:19:57) indicated, an opportunity as well.

franchise of close to 1,200 team members from the legacy Signature portfolio that's managing, of course, a $30
billion deposit, that has tremendous operating leverage for the franchise of which, I think it's probably close to
40% of their deposit base is at zero.

A
That's right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Janet Lee Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. And can you give us an update on the progress of bringing back Signature non-interest-bearing deposits
that have left during the third quarter and maybe 4Q-to-date? Has it accelerated versus the $285 million that you
brought in during the second quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
A
Yeah. We're really stable. I mean, we brought in nearly $300 million again in deposits. So they continue to flow
back. And that's in the face of obviously the most difficult deposit environment that we've seen in our careers for
sure. So we're very pleased with the traction that we're gaining. We had growth in both the West Coast banking
teams and the East Coast banking teams as well as the new FRB teams that we brought on board. So we're
seeing growth from all areas of our traditional banking teams.

Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I'll just add some comments there. I spent most of the summer meeting both PCGs as well as our new client base
and close to 1,000 hands I've shaken for over the summer. And it was amazing to see the connectivity between
the PCG teams and the client and the loyalty factor behind that. So we're very proud of the team. We're proud
that they're able to go through a significant adverse time in March and see an opportunity here on the new
Flagstar, and we're very pleased with the success on the stability of the base.

Accounts are still there, they may be cleaned out as far as some of the excess liquidity to the market, but they're
not leaving the institution when it comes to the actual relationship. But they [ph] did lose (00:22:28) some
significant deposits. So when we did the transaction in March, that institution was at a much higher base. And
when we stepped in, it's been stable, which is a very positive signal for what we expected. And as you can recall
from the original deal mechanics, we felt there would be further runoff just because of the unknown factor as we
came into a very tumultuous time.

Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. So just on purchase accounting accretion, if you could just remind us on 3Q for the NIM, how
much there was, what the split was between Flagstar and Signature? And based on your 4Q guide of NIM, what
you're expecting?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Sure, Bernard. If you look, we did add a slide, I don't know if you saw it, in the earnings presentation around the
purchase accounting accretion because we knew we were going to get some questions on that. So it was about
$100 million that came in in September. The split is about 70% Signature and about 30% from the Flagstar
transaction. From a forecasting perspective, we're expecting it to be a little bit lower than that in the fourth quarter.
Not substantially. We believe that we have another quarter or so at a pretty high run rate from the Signature
transaction giving how we're seeing some pay downs. We will see the Flagstar piece start to slow down here as
we get to the one-year mark in December. But, right now, that's where we kind of expected to be pretty close to
that level around $100 million.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Von Gizycki Q

Okay. Great. And then, just on deposits, I know in the past you guys have talked about the banking-as-a-service

you kind of think of how non-interest-bearing deposits could trend maybe going into next year?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I'll start off and then I'm going to defer it to Reggie, but I will tell you that the reality is that we have a lot of
interesting opportunities in front of us. We did mention about a year ago that we did successfully compete and
actually win the opportunity within the California unemployment fund. That should be coming on sometime early in
2024. That'll be a nice pickup for the institution. With that being said, there's so many different lines of businesses
as well as opportunities. I'd love to have Reggie Davis just share some thoughts on the deposit strategy because
we're really excited what we can do in the future. So, Reggie, if you don't mind.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Reginald E. Davis A
Senior Executive Vice President & President-Consumer & Corporate Banking, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Sure, Tom. So not a lot more to add around banking-as-a-service in addition to what Tom said. But, as you
know, that business kind of comes in from an opportunistic standpoint. So we've got a lot in the pipeline and we
feel really good about our prospects winning additional business. But we don't try to project out exactly where that
book is going to be. I think where we've had a lot of success this year is in our consumable, which – that that
tends to be a little bit more steady, a little bit more predictable. And I feel really good about where that retail
business is positioned. Particularly given the tough environment, the team has done a lot of really good work. Our
relationship banking model this year really proved its value, tremendous amount of stability in that book. We
actually brought both the branch teams together this year, combined the back office. We're now operating under
the same leadership structure, same sales and service model.
That model change went really well, no disruptions. We're in the process of introducing a more scaled and
consistent sales culture across the entire network of 380 branches. It's designed to create a great client
experience, and it will be uniquely Flagstar positioned with the brand that Tom talked about. And if you kind of
think about where we are, there's a lot of upside in that business. The legacy Flagstar branches are still only able
to open accounts in branch. That's 40% of our franchise, about 157 branches. Next year, we'll be able to have
online capabilities, so we know that will actually increase our net acquisition.
This year, for the first year, we began using targeted digital marketing in our NYCB footprint to drive new client
acquisition. That's gone well. We've introduced a new skinny down version of our AI-powered client relationship
tool, which is called next-gen sales in our NYCB branches. That's had tremendous impact. We see increases in
new account balances, all those validated. And then next year, we'll be fully operational across the entire footprint
with additional enhancements for that tool.
But we feel really good. The portfolio has performed well this year. Quarter-over-quarter, we're only down $500
million, which is less than 1.5%. Most of the year, we've had success with this high-touch model. If you look at our
weighted average cost, it's only up 177 basis points since January against the Fed funds increase of 525 basis
points. So we're really pleased with the retention in that portfolio.
And I think another good news story is, from a CD renewal perspective, we've been above the 80% retention rate
all year, which is kind of top of class from an industry perspective. We had 20% of our CD book renewed between
August and September. We had 81% retention rate on that. Average rate went from at [ph] 1.7% (00:27:52) at
maturity to less than 5%. So positioned well below the kind of market leaders in terms of rate. So we continue to
be really optimistic around deposit. It's one of the success stories we've got this year.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey, guys. Good morning. I was wondering, was any of the $62 million provision this quarter did have any specific
reserves in there for those two credits you singled out? And have you reappraised those two properties?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So both of those two properties as they go through the process of nonperforming were both recently
reappraised. So the charge-off on the Syracuse loan was based, of course, on that most recent appraisal. And
then if you look at the $62 million, the bulk of the provision was one to really restore the allowance for the charge-
offs that we took as well as some small, modest growth that we had, some CRE modeling changes through the
Moody's macroeconomic factor.
And then another – more qualitative like factor related to the office portfolio. That's kind of how it was broken apart
to get to that $62 million. But, yes, both of those loans have recent appraisals on them. And again, we're holding
them now, where we believe, especially on that Syracuse loan, the write-down we've taken, we're very
comfortable with where that is in the same process we use for decades when we take charge-offs.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. And then just a follow up, unrelated, and this may seem like a hard thing to imagine right now, but could
you consider doing additional sort of troubled bank acquisitions if they came along? And hopefully they don't, but
if there were some failed institutions in 2024, do you think it's conceivable that you could do another transaction?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Hey, Mark. It's Tom. I will tell you that we are laser-focused on building new Flagstar. We have a lot on our plate,
as you can imagine. March came along unexpectedly from pretty much everybody, and we were able to be
accommodative and work with the government to facilitate what we believe a very good transaction. We're busy,
right? We want to get our conversions done. We got to get our systems in order. We have a lot of integration that
we want to make sure we prioritize.
So I will tell you that we're very pleased where we are and we're building new Flagstar and it's unlikely that we'll
be participating in growth opportunities and the company's gone from $60 billion to $120-ish billion and that's a lot
of growth and we have a lot of work to do in front of us and the team is [indiscernible] (00:30:37) with Reggie, [ph]
Davis and Eric (00:30:41) and all the great team members we have here, we're busy. So we have the priority of
getting us to be that $100 billion institution where we feel very proud of the back office, the system conversion. A
lot of work ahead of us, Mark.

Morning, Brody.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning. Hey. I just wanted to follow up on those two office credits. I wanted to ask, what was the LTV
on those loans prior to the reappraisal, John, and where did the LTV go on reappraisal prior to you charging them
down?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, let me defer to John Adams. He's actually in my office. So, John, do you want to just address those two
credits.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Adams A
Director-Indirect Multi-Family Lending & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning. Both f those credits at the time of origination were 65% or less. They were originated quite some
time before the pandemic. The impact of the pandemic and obviously leasing activity and vacancies, both of those
credits at the time that we reappraised, obviously, Syracuse was more than 100%, but the larger asset in the city,
90%.

Syracuse had a significant tenant. This was a unique iconic building that blessed its major tenant. And we'll deal it
as we go along here. We were very active to get the appraisal up there. We took a much lower valuation and we'll
work through the workout process. Feel good about the fact that this is at a level that we can move this, we will be
happy, but we'll work with the existing borrower to see if he wants to try to work through the bank. If not, we will
have people that are willing to step in here.

Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. And I just wanted to get a sense for you, do you have an idea for what the lease roles look like for
the rest of the office portfolio? If it was a – if it was a tenant leaving that kind of caused the issue with the
Syracuse portfolio, just wanted to get a sense for what those lease roles look like?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Sorry, this is Tom, again. I would say big picture, we know we're going through that process, we talked about
Manhattan. We have about [ph] $1.8 billion at the Trump, $1.8 billion in Manhattan (00:33:02). Very cognizant of
what's coming due when it comes to refinancing and respect the coupons as well as the tenancy. We evaluate
that. Feel pretty good about the portfolio. But this is a an environment where you have to have an enhanced
monitoring.
The company is doing a lot of work to ensure that we're getting updated financial statements. This is that time of
year. From now until the end of the year, we get a lot of new financial statements. As John indicated, we updated
the macroeconomic backdrop towards the credit environment, in particular, CRE. But clearly, this is a unique
portfolio. Typically and historical basis, it was a sponsor-driven opportunity for the bank. Historically, we've had a
very strong mix, a very strong family that actually buy into the multi-family and CRE market opportunistically, tied
to the 1031 Exchange opportunity when it comes to tax deferrals. And we have a very strong overall average LTV
and a strong debt service coverage ratio. You're going to have one-offs from time to time. I will call this particular
one a one up. We don't see a trends yet, but we're monitoring it very carefully.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brody Preston Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And I'll just ask one more and then hop out. Just a clarifying one on the average earning asset guide. Was
that stable at $107 million for the fourth quarter? And if so, could you clarify the moving parts there for me, John,
just given the period end was quite a bit lower than that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So what we're looking at is from an average perspective, we expect that cash and securities will be pretty
flat. We don't expect significant declines in those two items. Now, once again, that depends, of course, on our
success in bringing in deposits in the quarter. And we do expect to have some loan growth, nothing substantial,
but just a little bit of loan growth here, which is why we think we can be pretty close to that. I don't think – like I
mentioned, we're not going to see the big declines we've seen in the past. There'll still be a little bit of a mix shift
between cash, securities and loans. We just don't expect it to be as big a drop as it was quarter over quarter. It's
going to be relatively consistent.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I would just add to that point, it's Tom, again, that strategically we put out a plan when we announced the
receivership transaction and how we see the balance sheet coming in at year end. Now, we're focusing on the
businesses. And the businesses will have some businesses actually seeing declines, in particular, multi-family,
CRE, the business is very slow, you'll see the offset of growth in the C&I portfolios. We're very, very optimistic
about the opportunity on overall interest rates when it comes to residential lending. We have Lee Smith on the
line, he can expand upon the opportunity there. It's a much different market when it comes to resi lending. So our

mortgage bank has been right-sized back in January, so we actually are making money in the line of business,
which is not common in financial services in today's environment, but clearly have other levers to pull. And
probably the augmentation of the balance sheet will continue.
You'll see more of a shift away from CRE and multi-family just because of the market. There's not a lot of activity
and our spreads about 300-basis point spread off the 5-year treasury and probably wider than where the
government is. And the government will be proactive with their balance sheet. We will be less proactive and we'll
be focusing on relationships for deposit gathering. So like I indicated, going back to the strategy, it's going to be
about relationship banking and all the lines of businesses and we've seen some good pickup on homebuilder
finance business, good pick up on the C&I business as far as really getting a seat at the table and getting deposit
flows tied to the businesses that we're banking on the corporate bank sponsorship side.
With that, I'm going to pass the baton over to Lee to get some update on mortgage and what we see the
opportunity in respect to the mortgage market. So Lee Smith?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Lee Matthew Smith A
Senior Executive Vice President & President-Mortgage, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, sure. Thanks, Tom. I think there's a number of opportunities. I think, first of all, just from an origination point
of view, if you look at Q3 versus Q2, the market was down 6% quarter-over-quarter and our mock mortgage locks
were down only 1.7% and we actually saw gain on sale margin expansion of about 8 basis points or 15% quarter-
over-quarter. And I think we've benefited from dislocation in the market. Certainly in the TPO channels, we've
seen a major player exit, we've seen others exit, we've been able to bring in some very strong accounts
executives. We've brought in some new clients and we're getting a greater share of wallet from existing
customers as well.
So we've benefited on the origination side, to Tom's point. We've right-sized our operation. From an infrastructure
point of view, we've taken about 65% of our infrastructure cost out from the high of 2021. And the mortgage
origination business, which includes the return on MSR, is profitable and we're very pleased about that in this
environment.
That dislocation is also spreading to the warehouse lending business. And so, as I mentioned, the market was
down 6%, but average outstandings from a warehouse point of view were up $600 million or 14%. And, again, as
we've seen dislocation and people exiting that space, we've been able to benefit from that as well.
And then I think, finally, and Tom has talked about deposits, when you look at the mortgage vertical and you look
at all the various ways that we're plugged in to the mortgage ecosystem from an origination, a servicing, a lending
point of view, and then you've got the cash and treasury management team that we acquired as part of the
Signature acquisition, we've got somewhere between $10 billion and $12 billion of deposits that are coming from
that mortgage vertical.
There's about $5.5 billion coming from the servicing or sub-servicing business and all the loans on the servicing
platform. And then there's another $4.25 million to $6.5 billion, $7 billion from that team that came over from
Signature. Some of those are escrow deposits, and so those balances typically move between [ph] $4.25 billion
and $6.75 billion (00:39:10). But this $10 billion to $12 billion of deposits on the balance sheet that are coming
from that mortgage vertical and the ecosystem that we're working with day in, day out and we think we can attract
more deposits over time from that ecosystem.

I want to add [ph] in lease business (00:39:30) is clearly the opportunity that we look at the [ph] hybrid arm
(00:39:32) market right now. We do have a tremendous opportunity as customers are looking away from the [ph]
30 or 15-year (00:39:38) mark and focusing on a shorter duration opportunity, which really is underwriting a very
low LTV is an opportunity for this bank to look at balance sheet opportunities and look at an asset class we're very
comfortable with [ph] on (00:39:50) putting on given the changes in interest rates, which will also be a potential for
organic growth for the company, especially tied to the opportunity with some of our new team members that have

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning. So, you spoke about NIM stepping down from 3.27% to about 3%, 3.10%. And the majority of
the custodial deposits going away and earning assets being relatively flat. So, it sounds like NII of roughly a little
bit over $800 million or so next quarter is what you're guiding to. So, A, do I have that right? And B, I think more
broadly, how are you thinking about the run rate for net interest income for next year? Is that $800 million plus
number a good starting point from which you can grow through 2024?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I'll start and I'll pass the baton to John, our CFO. I will tell you big picture, it seems like we've got to 3% a lot faster
than I expected from the transaction and the overall margin. So obviously, we're still asset sensitive. We're
pleased on the results thus far. Regarding the future guidance, we don't have future guidance out there in the
marketplace, but we are very optimistic with the diversification in our asset mix. We're not that same bank that we
were a year ago when it comes to legacy thrift models. We have diversification that has a lot of floating rate
coupons tied to higher spreads. We have unique businesses tied to the C&I marketplace. We have, as we
indicated, [indiscernible] (00:41:29) business that has an opportunity on a hybrid arm book of business as well.
So, when you look at future asset growth, it's going to be diversification within the portfolio, and rates have
significantly increased.
Just to give you some data points on the CRE multifamily portfolio, we have $18 billion coming due over the next
36 months. Next year alone, it's about $4.5 billion, multifamily coupon at 382 coming due and CRE at 575. You

bring that to the market, that's a powerful benefit for the asset yield. That goes consistently between $4 billion to
$7 billion each year that we know is coming due, and we'll deal with it as they come due. Now all those loans are
not going to stay with the bank. It's going back to our focus. It's going to be relationship banking.
And if the government steps in, the government can gladly step in for customers who don't want to have deposits.
But the reality is we're going to focus on making sure that customers get to the other side and we're going to work
with our customers very carefully on the relationship banking side. And there's no relationship. We're really not
interested in partnering with just loan activity that are coming off coupons, that are well below the market. So, we
have an opportunity to really price up that portfolio. And growth is not going to drive profitability in that book.
Now the other lines of businesses can grow very, very favorably here given the current spreads that we're seeing
in all lines of business and banking. Spreads have changed dramatically across the financial services spectrum
since March. As I indicated, we're 300 basis points better. We're not moving on that. It would have been very
proactive to have strong economic spread on the multifamily CRE side. But [ph] all spreads throughout (00:42:58)
all lines of business have clearly upped quite a bit given the interest rate environment.
So with that being said, I'll pass the baton to John to add more color on...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, just quickly on the fourth quarter, we're not going to see declines in the spot balances that we've seen,
right, on interest earning assets or on total assets. So, total assets is about $111 million, I'm sorry, $111 billion.
That we're not going to see the continued drops in that, that we've seen quarter – in the last couple of quarters
due to pay down on the cash. The average will still be down, just not down as much as it was when you look at
Q2 to Q3 is our expectation.
So, it's not going to be exactly the 107. We just believe that the rate of change on the average is starting to
decline as we're hitting our spot balances here. We don't think we'll drop much lower than this, this $111 billion
that we were as of 9/30. So, that's the only piece I want to make sure that I clarify.

Now the one other point I would say we're really focusing on creating this institution that we're going to be
agnostic to changes of interest rates. We really want to get away from being so significantly asset sensitive and
reliability sensitive, we were on the legacy thrift model, that was our Achilles heel. We had a significant history of
liability sensitivity. We're moving towards, as John indicated, neutrality, was still asset sensitive and it's rising rate
environment, current rate environment that will add to continued margin benefits. But ultimately, rates go up or
down. We want to have a very strong margin as we run these businesses through changes of interest rate. That's
the focus to build this institution going forward under the new Flagstar.

those loans would be 300 basis points to 400 basis points or so?

I mean right now, they're multifamily books for next year to [ph] 382 coming due and it's CRE 575 (00:44:42). So,
market is what right now about [ph] 300 of the five years (00:44:46) is probably close to close to [ph] 877
difference (00:44:48). So, that's a pretty big difference. We have different product mix, which we're proud that
we're offering to our customers to work with them. We have a structure that's synthetic, that kind of mimics what's
being done in the government market, which is a new product to the bank. We have the SOFR option on
repricing, which has been very positive for their refinancing opportunities. And they'll choose when they want to
[ph] lock in long (00:45:12).
Most of our customers feel that in the years ahead, there'll be lower rates. So, they're waiting on the sidelines
paying a much higher interest rate today, the ones that are staying with us, and the ones that are going away are
typically going to the government.

Manan Gosalia Q

Got it. Okay. And then just another question on expenses. It looks like there is high expenses associated with the
Flagstar conversion and Signature loan to your servicing that will come out at some point in the next year. Can
you size the expense benefits that come from that?

John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. We're going to provide our full 2024 guide at our next – at our conference call in January. But as we
mentioned, we've seen both headwinds and tailwinds for 2024 when compared to 2023. And those systems
integrations will provide us the benefit and some cost reductions as well as depending on what happens with the
rest of the FDIC receivership loans, the multifamily and the CRE loans, if those do end up transferring to a
purchaser in this fourth quarter, then we'll have some benefits also on the cost side from that extra servicing that
we no longer have.

John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So we – yeah, correct, we expect cash and securities, when you look at them combined, to be relatively flat
depending on the changes in the balance sheet, right? We are hoping to bring in deposits from multiple teams is
what Reggie was speaking about and [ph] Eric (00:47:21) on both the consumer and the private banking side. So,
any shortfall we can make up with either in the brokered CD market or in the wholesale borrowing market just to
ensure that we have the appropriate liquidity on the balance sheet for each quarter that we go through this
process.
So, we just – we don't expect significant changes and significant drops from the period-end balance. But we will
take a look and see what market conditions provide and how our deposit growth comes in, in the fourth quarter.

Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Casey, this is Tom. [ph] Just on that point (00:47:57), when you think about where we came out of March, we
were in a different position, right? We had a lot of liquidity. We had the ability to take a step back. We weren't
chasing deposits, weren't chasing rates the industry has. So, we've been very proactive on paying down brokered
deposits across brokers, also high-cost borrowing that came due as a strategy to get to 12/31. That's the public
strategy from the receivership transaction. Going forward, it's going to go back to an organic strategy focusing on
deposit initiatives on all of our lines of businesses.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. Understood. And then just one more on expenses. The guide for 2023 implies a pretty wide range of
anywhere from [ph] $510 million to $610 million (00:48:40) in the fourth quarter. I mean, I think most of us expect
kind of a flat number, but your guide does allow for some upward expense pressure in the fourth quarter. Just
wondering what would drive that, another $20 million or so?

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
Yeah. I would think that – given where we came out in the third quarter, the third quarter had higher expenses
compared to the second quarter, I wouldn't expect the run rate to be above that. So, that would fall [ph] as right
(00:49:08) really close to the middle of the guide. And I think there's opportunities to do slightly better than that in
the fourth quarter as well to get to more than mid to the low end of that guide. So, yes, the guide for the year,
when you only have a quarter left, I understand that it's pretty wide, but I would focus on the midpoint of the guide.

Matthew Breese Q

Tom, I was hoping you could touch on the wholesale borrowings coming due in the fourth quarter. I think they had
a near 4% rate. What's the anticipated strategy with those as they assumedly get calls?

Thomas Robert Cangemi A

I'll pass that to John. John?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Including the puts that we have, it's $3 billion at 4% for the rest of this quarter. Given where the portables
are of that amount, it's about $1.4 billion in portables. We expect they will be put. So, that $3 billion we would
expect to refi unless we have deposit growth to pay them off, we would expect to refi them in the market as we go
forward here or, like I said, if we have deposit growth, we'll pay them off.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And similar to the Signature custody deposits running off, we should not really anticipate that much
movement in cash balances from 3Q to 4Q. It feels like the $6 billion level is where you want to keep cash for
now.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. When you look at – I would look at the cash and the securities together, but I think that's right, around $6
billion makes sense depending on the level of deposit growth, what we are seeing, the type of deposits that come
in. We want to make sure that we stay liquid from an on balance sheet perspective with cash and security. So,
[ph] kind of I think (00:51:04) around $6 billion makes sense on the cash side depending on where our securities
end up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then just to clear up the prior discussion around average earning asset balances for the fourth quarter,
it sounds like maybe they will trend lower, just not at the same page we just saw. Is that an accurate statement?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Right. That's right. The spot balances are not going to move dramatically from the $110 million, but the average
will still trend down. It's just the rate of change is starting to slow, right?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
And when do you expect to start to see average earning asset growth again?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I think once we get through the fourth quarter and these – the custodial deposits are the biggest driver of this,
right? I mean, we went from $6 billion at the end of June to $2 billion now. And then we have – after that, once we
get to December, we're going to be very low in that number. So, I think once we hit our December period-end
balances, which will not be too dramatically different, we don't believe to the 9/30 piece, then we'll start to see the
average start to stabilize and start to grow depending on loan growth once you get into the first quarter of 2024.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Just going back to credit beyond the office loans, within the release, it showed that multifamily loans, I think
NPAs there are up to $60 million, just been steadily increasing. I was hoping you could talk about your broader
multifamily portfolio. How much is rent regulated? I think in the past, it's been $19 billion, of which $13 billion are
for buildings where units – rent regulated units are north of 50%. Starting to see any sort of cracks there? It just
feels like there's a pileup of issues from the 2019 rent [ph] loss (00:52:49).
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Now, let me start off and I'm going to pass the baton to John Adams, who runs that portfolio. The reality is that the
– it's one-off families [indiscernible] (00:52:58), maybe one or two families that one's going through a marital
dispute that's going through the court system and there's a handful of those credits tied to a relationship. It's a
handful of relationships. It's not systemic. It's not something we're seeing yet.

So, we're clearly monitoring. Rates are dramatically higher and our customers [ph] don't have (00:53:16) the
capacity to deal with the SOFR option and with fixed rate option tied to a derivative option that we offer to them.
So, it's been proactive. And if they want to go for long-term financing and they want to go to the government, the
government is open for business and most banks have widened their spreads given the economic backdrop [ph]
of what (00:53:53) we're seeing in credit spreads.
So, it's been a relatively strong book, like I said, a very powerful position regarding the consistency of
performance. We're not seeing trends. With that, I'll pass over to John to give some color. John?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John T. Adams A
Director-Indirect Multi-Family Lending & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Thanks, Tom. Yes, exactly what Tom said, some of those instances, they're really more family-related issues and
not really the performance of the assets themselves. There are some instances where a lot of the issues from
them not being able to pay timely because the tenants aren't paying. And those are typically in the more working
class neighborhoods in the rent regulated properties that, they know the system. They know how to drag on an
eviction process.
So, it's not really rapid. And for the rest of the portfolio, outside of those isolated instances, the market rents, like
Tom mentioned earlier are up, I think 4% month over month. And you just can't kill the New York multifamily
market. So, we're monitoring the rent regulated properties closely. But there's not really a lot of cracks in that
particular portfolio that is really raising anything for us to have any real concern over it right at this time.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. The follow-up question there is, Signature's commercial real estate, multifamily and then rent-regulated
multifamily portfolio is being bid out. And some of the news articles out there are citing this as a more difficult
portfolio to sell. When it sells – if it sells and depending on the price, does this come into play for your balance
sheet in any way, shape or form? Does it impact the level three asset pricing and your estimated fair value of your
own loan portfolio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, let me give you my big picture thoughts on that, right, we are cash flow lender [ph] for deeply (00:55:26)
discounted rental [indiscernible] (00:55:27). We've been doing this for long time. We are not mark-to-market. I
can't comment specifically on what's going to happen for the unknown on the portfolio, but ultimately my guess is
that the assets will trade. I think it will be a little bit more complicated given the rent regulated nuance to a portion
of that portfolio. In my view, that's something that's got interesting views in respect to the ongoing landlords and
the tenants and happy relationship going forward, whoever buys that portfolio. That's something that – that's a
nuance that we haven't seen before. We haven't seen such a large transaction in the market, but the non-rent
regulated portfolio will trade at a clearing price depending on interest rate and credit marks.
And I don't believe in my opinion it's going to impact mark-to-market in respect to institution that's been putting on
the portfolio, going to maturity and the ability to hold that portfolio as a cash flow lender. And as far as clearing
prices, at the end of the day, there's not a lot of trades going on, there's not a lot of activity for buying and selling.
These assets will go through the market eventually and we'll deal with the outcome of their activity and there'll be
probably some smart individual investors that will probably do financially well like pricing it accordingly. It gets a

little bit more complicated on the rent regulated portfolio just because of the community ties and the nuances
between landlord and tenant relationships.
We've done a tremendous job on really managing that process as a community institution, focusing on working
with the landlords, working with the tenant community groups and being part of that [ph] ambassador (00:56:59) in
between that. A new player coming in doesn't have that culture, that history, so making it challenging.
So, that seems a little bit complicated. But at the end of the day, my view is the assets will trade eventually and
we'll move on from that. I don't call it a mark-to-market per se if you're a cash flow lender. And we are a
discounted cash flow lender given that rent-regulated portfolio that's traditionally significantly below traditional
market [ph] record (00:57:22).

Just one point to that. We are building a corporate bank sponsorship division that actually participates on
originating and selling to the syndicate market, generating the opportunity for fees for the bank going forward with
more of a commercial bank [ph] flair 00:58:06) to that, using the derivative marketplaces. So, clearly moving
towards that commercial bank mentality, not just making a loan and holding loan, but making a loan and holding a
piece of the loan but selling a large amount of the exposure off to the secondary market. So, that's going to be the
strategy as we build up the commercial bank model.

Yeah. Tom, let me just – let me – I think that's an important point. When you ask about the size of the syndicated
book, we use syndications primarily to sell down positions. We're not out buying participations for the most part.
That is primarily an offensive play for us and allows us to participate to a larger extent with our most important

David Smith Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Good morning. Appreciate the clarification on the earning asset outlook. I think a lot of us were confused that
getting to flattish on average mark when the spot balance is more around one or two. But it sounds like you're just
saying that the decline will be smaller than the $4.2 billion that we saw on average assets from 2Q to 3Q. So,
something above $1 billion or $3 billion presumably for the fourth quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. Yeah, what we're talking about is the actual – start with the spot balance. We don't anticipate to be
dramatically smaller. A lot of the pay downs have already occurred. As I mentioned at the last question, cash
around $6 billion give or take where securities [ph] end (00:59:40). So, the drop in cash is – the significant drop in
cash has basically stopped here. So, this is about where we'll be. So, the average will continue to decline, as it
catches up to the spot balance. And then once we're – once that's been pretty consistent, which we believe will
start in the fourth quarter, then hopefully we can see some of the average balances start to grow after that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Smith Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research US LP
Okay. Got it. And then beyond the bulk of the remaining $2 billion of custodial deposits running off presumably in
a week or so, as you said, I appreciate that you're expecting and planning for some deposit growth across the
businesses. But anything else you can keep in mind in terms of seasonality of deposits or anything like that, that
might help influence the average balance in the fourth quarter compared to the 9/30 spot balance?

No. There's really not a seasonality. There's some movement within the month. But basically, any seasonality

Good morning. Following up on the multifamily lending and commercial real estate, just given where pricing is
these days, curious where debt service coverage ratios are shaping out, whether it's on a renewal or a reset, and
if you're seeing any borrowers who are having to put up additional cash to support the property.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I'll start the response and then I'll defer to John Adams. But I will tell you that it's been relatively strong given many
of the customers are able to look at their options and their option is a SOFR option or a fixed rate option, and we
work with them and have the capacity to continue to pay. The ones that are looking to get more dollars, I think it's

And the reality is that when they do have significant equity and they're looking for locking in [ph] loan (01:01:57),
which a lot of them are, they're not looking to [ph] lock in loan (01:01:59). They really believe rates will be lower in
the future. They're choosing to roll to the higher coupon in the market. And when they do go to the refinancing
market, it's us and or the agency market as being the opportunity. And like I indicated, we're focusing on
relationship deposit banking.
So, it's going to have compensating balances, which is going to be critical for our business model going forward.
And more importantly, if there's equity there and they're looking at economic spreads, they're much wider and the
government's probably slightly tighter than us. And that's an option to go along. But a lot of customers are waiting

coupon and today, it's seven plus, sure the debt service coverage isn't where it was typically when the loan was
originated, but there's still enough coverage for them to meet all their obligations, operating as well as debt
service. And obviously, we tracked that on an annual basis and if they are less than what we would expect, they
get risk graded accordingly, and they get reserved the way that they should be based on our model.
So, something that we do – definitely keep an eye on, but in answer to your question, if there's not enough to
refinance out, yeah, the debt service coverages have come down, but not to the point where they can't meet their
obligations.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I would say we haven't seen many customers that had to write a check to do a refinancing, yes. But rates are
much higher than they were a year ago. And as the customers come to us, our goal here is to get them to the
other side. It's a difficult environment coming from a much lower rate, let's say the mid-3s to now, let's say, mid-
7s, to almost 8 on a fixed rate. Now you can probably do something floating somewhere in [indiscernible]
(01:03:46) 50 basis points, 60 basis points below that and government's [indiscernible] (01:03:50) will be 50 basis
points inside of that. So, we're being proactive to get the customer to the other side, given the challenges because
of the significant changes of interest rates.

Okay. And then on the office portfolio, just curious here. John, you mentioned a qualitative factor for office.
Curious what's the reserve allocated to that portfolio just given the mix of criticized and classified?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, we don't split it out specifically. But it is something that has been growing, especially given the $62 million
provision that we booked this quarter. But like we talked about before, prior to this quarter, the performance has
been extremely strong. So, we continue to look at that. We continue to look at the SDRs and the LTVs and the
portfolio as well, as well as the deep dive we've been doing into the underlying leases in the portfolio. So we're
comfortable with where we are right now but we did start to see a bit of a build, an allowance build here this
quarter.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Peter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Good morning. Good morning, Tom. Will you guys have to go through the formal [ph] DFAS (01:05:08) exam next
year? I'm just wondering if you can quantify the expense component that needs to be realized as part of a [ph]
DFAS (01:05:17) bank.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, let me just start off and I'm going to pass that to John. We are going to go through a – always go through a
capital planning process and we've been doing [ph] DFAS (01:05:27) process prior to the change in the limit when
$50 billion became much higher. With that being said, we will go through that process – I believe we'll go through
that process in early 2024, and I don't believe it's a public process, but it's going to go through the process and
we're preparing for that. John, if you want to...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, that's right. I mean, we will continue to do what we have been doing and since we started building to get
ready for the old $50 billion threshold back in 2012 with preparing a capital plan, submitting a capital plan, going
through the process. We have a significant stress testing group that we've put in place a long time ago and have
added two to be ready for – the plan to be ready to be over $100 billion. So, yes, we'll be performing those. We'll
be performing that process in 2024. And then we'll probably be part of the next cycle when it comes to the public
process that Tom was mentioning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then can you just talk about maybe the outlook for provision expense? When I look at
the ACL ratio, it increased a little bit to 0.74%. But do you need to keep adding to reserves just given the change
to the composition of the loan portfolio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, there's no doubt that the loan portfolio composition has changed, and we're a much more diversified lender
now than we have been. And that ratio has consistently gone up since the acquisitions of both Flagstar and
Signature. But what it really comes down to under CECL is the macroeconomic factors and the performance of
the portfolio. So, depending on what the trend is here in those macroeconomic factors, we have seen them
decline but relatively stable decline in those types of factors. But if – depending on how that comes out and
depending on the growth in the portfolios, we could see the provisions move around a little bit here, but it really
depends on those macroeconomic factors and what we're seeing in the individual portfolios.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Got it. Thanks very much.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac with Janney Montgomery Scott.
Please go ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Good morning, Chris.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Hey. Thanks for taking all of our questions. Tom, just a quick one about the
enforcement of kind of new loan – new deposits with new loans. Can you write in your contracts higher interest
rates if the compensating balances go below certain threshold? Is that something that you can do in this era?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Robert Cangemi A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
No. What we have on our agreements, we do have a requirements to have operating accounts and there's no
question during the pandemic, it was critical. And it really gave us some good guidance on where the cash flows
are coming in given the unknown of the pandemic. We carried into that into our [ph] docs (01:08:23) that we have,
an expectation of an operating account regarding the cash flow of the, in particular, the properties that we have to
make sure that the cash flow is coming in.
But I think the reality is that we have long-standing relationships. We are going to prioritize the capital allocation
towards relationship banking in all businesses, and I think that's how we're going to be successful. There was a
significant shift about three years ago, and it's been very proactive on CAGR roles of significance when it comes
to the multifamily CRE portfolio. And I would say as far as what we saw running out of the bank is maybe 5%. The
95% will understand that we want to ensure that we have a strong depositor relationship. And as we move
forward, it'll be more towards this expectation of compensating balances. In certain many – in many instances,
that's also tied to lines of credit. And we're really working with the client to really ensure that we are a bank
partnership. We expect reciprocation when it comes to the business opportunity. If it doesn't happen, we're very
glad to allocate that capital to other lines of businesses and we have other avenues where historically we did not.

Q3 2023 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2023
Oh, yeah, thanks for the follow-up. Just a clarification, two quick modeling questions. The expenses, I think last
quarter, you said included in your guide was a potential for an FDIC assessment. I just wanted to verify that.
And then secondarily, do you happen to have the spot deposit cost and beta assumptions from here? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John J. Pinto A
Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. In that $2 billion to $2.1 billion, the FDIC assessment is in that guide. And then when you're looking at betas
quarter-over-quarter, they were relatively consistent in September. We're still under 40%, just under 40% both in
June and in September. And our spot interest-bearing basically our end of September, interest-bearing deposit
cost for the quarter was $337 million. And then really towards the end of September was $350 million.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. Thanks, John. Perfect.
