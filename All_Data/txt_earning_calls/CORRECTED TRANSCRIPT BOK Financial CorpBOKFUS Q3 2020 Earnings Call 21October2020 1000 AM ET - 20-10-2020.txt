Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
Steven Glen Bradshaw
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Thanks for joining us to discuss the third quarter 2020 financial results. This quarter was another in which our fee
businesses highlighted the effectiveness of our diversified revenue strategy as we eclipsed $150 million in net
income for the first time in the history of our company.
Shown on slide 4, third quarter net income was $154 million or $2.19 per diluted share. That represents EPS
growth of over 9% from the same quarter a year ago. A remarkable outcome given today's very different
economic environment. The key items that drove our success this quarter were a fourth consecutive record
revenue quarter from our Wealth Management business, another exceedingly strong production and margin
quarter from our Mortgage team. No credit loss provision was needed this quarter.
Net interest margin was stable due primarily to an increase in acceleration that we will detail momentarily with
additional support from highly disciplined deposit pricing and an increase in the effectiveness of floors in our
commercial loan book. And lastly, we have diligently controlled expenses from the outset of the business impact
brought about by COVID-19.
Turning to slide 5, while average loans were flat this quarter, average deposits were up over 6% linked quarter
and up nearly 35% from the same quarter a year ago due primarily to customers retaining higher balances in this
current economic environment.
Assets under management or in custody were up nearly 4% linked quarter and 2% year-over-year again topping
$80 billion. We attribute the growth to positive market movement along with better results in the quarter from
active sales and asset retention efforts. I'll provide some additional perspective on the results before the start of
the Q&A session. But now Stacy Kymes will review the loan portfolio and our credit metrics in more detail.
I'll turn the call over now to Stacy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
Thanks, Steve. Turning to slide 7, period-end loans were $23.8 billion, down 1.5% for the quarter. Small pockets
of growth in our healthcare book was offset by pay downs in energy and across our core commercial and
industrial loan book. Some of this was continued repayment of defensive draws and some of this was through the
organic decline in economic activity and purposeful deleveraging by our customers.
Looking specifically at energy loans, they contracted 6.5% for the quarter. Commodity prices while improving still
make new deals difficult to source in the current environment, that we remain optimistic about our ability to
enhance market share long-term. Energy borrowers continue to pay down debt to reduce leverage at this point in
the cycle. Despite these factors, we remain open for business and continue to support our customers in the
energy industry. This business is more than just lending activities as evidenced by the record energy derivatives
revenue this quarter as customers continue to aggressively manage their commodity risk.
Commercial real estate loan balances were up 3.1% from the previous quarter largely due to continued friction in
a permanent financing market slowing the level of pay down activity. Looking forward, our outlook for loan growth
for the rest of the year remains tempered. The speed and shape of the broader economic recovery will be the
determining factor in restarting loan growth. We are optimistic that once pre-COVID normalcy returns to the
economy, we are well-positioned in our commercial lending portfolio to grow loans.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
Turning to slide 8, we supply the look into the loan deferral status across BOKF's portfolio. As you can see, just
1.2% of total loans remain in deferral status of any type. At the peak, that figure was 7.5% of total loans. So we
are happy to say that more than 80% of the loans that were deferred have now moved back to regular payment
status. Of the loans that remain in deferral status, roughly half are in the commercial real estate portfolio. These
are being closely monitored, but short-term the credit quality has held in better than our original expectations.
Long-term outcomes will be dependent on the pace of economic recovery and the impact of any additional fiscal
stimulus.
Also on slide 8, we've again compiled a list of loan segments, we consider, more exposed to the economic impact
of the pandemic. This group of loans is highly diversified with over 550 loans for an average loan size of less than
$3 million. Clearly, the $596 million retail portion of this portfolio remains the most vulnerable today and we'll
continue monitoring these exposures closely in the coming months. While office and multifamily may see impacts
here, we believe our geographic footprint will help us in these segments in the long-term because of the strong
and migration over time.
Turning to slide 9, you can see that credit quality remains stable as witnessed by our lack of credit loss provision
this quarter. As we mentioned last quarter, we felt the material reserve build would be largely complete, assuming
our economic forecast is in line going forward. Looking at the underlying components, a $1.7 million provision
related to lending activities was offset by a decrease in the accrual for expected credit losses for mortgage
banking activities and allowance for credit losses from investment securities.
Changes in our reasonable and supportable forecasts of macroeconomic variables, primarily due to an improved
economic outlook related to the anticipated impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and other assumptions
resulted in a $12.8 million decrease in the provision for credit losses from lending activities. Changes in the loan
portfolio characteristics, including specific impairment and losses, loan balances and risk grading resulted in a
$14.5 million increase in the provision for credit losses from lending activities.
Net charge-offs of $22.4 million or 37 basis points annualized is slightly above last quarter. Excluding PPP loans,
net charge-offs were 41 basis points annualized. Year-to-date net charge-offs totaled $53.7 million or 30 basis
points annualized, well within our company's historical loss experience. The combined allowance for loan losses
totaled $448 million or 1.88% of outstanding loans at September 30 compared to $469 million or 1.94% of
outstanding loans last quarter. The combined allowance for credit losses attributed to energy was 4.3% of
outstanding energy loans at September 30.
Non-accruing energy loans decreased $34 million this quarter attributed almost entirely to a decrease in non-
accruing energy loans. Potential problem loans totaled $623 million at quarter-end, down slightly from $626
million at June 30. A decrease in potential problem energy loans was partially offset by an increase in general
business loans and commercial real estate loans.
Just a quick note on energy credit, that is currently the largest driver of overall asset quality for the company. The
second quarter of 2020 was an imperfect storm for the semi-annual borrowing base redetermination process.
Given the impacts to supply from OPEC plus and demand from COVID-19 all hit in the midst of this process, for
borrowers even had time to react to manage their response. The result was a higher level of negative credit
migration. While commodity prices rose in the third quarter to a level that we expect to improve the credit outlook,
we do not upgrade credit in a [ph] wholesale (00:09:01) manner solely based on commodity price changes. As we
go through the semi-annual redetermination process in the fourth quarter, we would expect positive credit
migration if prices remain stable at these levels.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
I'll now turn the call over to highlight our NIM dynamics, fee revenues and the important balance sheet items for
the quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Thanks, Stacy. With record net income, this quarter is clearly another fantastic one for the company. Pre-
provision net revenue topped $200 million for the second consecutive time, demonstrating the full earnings power
of the company. Net interest revenue strength, net interest margin defense outsized fee revenue and diligent
expense management, all contributed to our success this quarter.
As noted on slide 11, net interest income was $272 million diligent expense management all contributed to our
success this quarter.
As noted on slide 11, net interest income was $272 million, down just over $6 million from last quarter. PPP loan
fee recognition contributed $11 million this quarter versus $13 million last quarter. Additionally, due to loan payoffs
and adjustments for acquired loans, discount accretion was $13 million this quarter versus only $3 million last
quarter.
Net interest margin was 2.81% compared to 2.83% in the previous quarter. Lower loan yields in the neared zero
rate environment were offset primarily by the acceleration of discount accretion from CoBiz acquired loans, which
supported net interest margin by 11 basis points versus last quarter and it is expected to normalize next quarter.
Additional support was provided by an 8-basis-point reduction in interest-bearing deposit costs, down to 26 basis
points and an increased effectiveness of floors in our commercial loan book as average LIBOR continue to fall in
the current quarter.
Turning to slide 12, clearly earnings this quarter was bolstered dramatically by $223 million in revenues from our
fee businesses, as our Wealth Management and Mortgage teams have continued their momentum to post
outstanding quarters. Elevated margin in mortgage reflect the continued lack of industry capacity, given the strong
demand in the current low rate environment. Mortgage production revenue remains high, just slightly below the
prior quarter. Refinances accounted for 54% of total originated this quarter, down from 71%.
Our Wealth Management team put together a fourth consecutive record total revenue quarter predating the low
rate environment we find ourselves in today. This quarter with a host of complementary business units, we saw
incredible deposit growth of over 8% linked quarter, significant financial market-based investment management
fees and risk management revenues and great synergies with Commercial Banking through the insurance arm
acquired by CoBiz. Altogether, exceptional performance, and Scott can provide additional detail during the
question-and-answer session.
Brokerage and trading revenue increased $7.5 million with commissions increasing $3 million. We continue to see
elevated mortgage-backed security trading activity out of our Connecticut office. Derivative fees and commissions
increased $2.4 million primarily due to the increased hedging activity from our energy clients, a result of our
expertise in that lending vertical. Investment banking revenue increased $1.8 million primarily due to the
increased syndication fees.
As we look forward to 2021, the team is adjusting strategy to overcome the decline in fees from traditional cash
investments that are now paying close to zero, providing further optimism for continued growth. Fee revenue now
represents 45% of total revenue, up from 40% in the same quarter last year. This once again demonstrates an
5

important differentiating characteristic of BOK Financial. We have long had a diverse revenue mix that provides
an earnings buffer in economic downturns because of the countercyclical nature of some of these fee revenue
streams.
The net economic benefit of changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and related economic hedges
was $6.5 million during the quarter, including a $3.4 million increase in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights,
$1.5 million increase in the fair value of securities and derivative contracts held as an economic hedge, and $1.6
million related net interest revenue.
Turning to slide 13, expense management remains prudent with an increase of just under $6 million. We have
managed personnel costs by holding the line on adding new positions and challenged the need to fill open
positions. Together, these actions worked to decrease regular compensation about $2.6 million this quarter. While
this will moderate a bit as our branch network has now opened, we have revised our branch strategy to a hybrid
model.
This new model will continue to meet the needs of our client, but recognizes that the pandemic has accelerated
customer behavior adoption of technology, and we will need to – fewer staff in locations to meet future need. This
is a change we recognized early in the pandemic, and we were able to make real steps towards efficiency. In fact,
looking at head count, we have absorbed approximately 140 positions company-wide. We're almost 3% of our
personnel base since March, simply through attrition and increased efficiency.
Elsewhere in personnel expense, incentive compensation increased $5.6 million due to a $3.1 million increase in
cash-based incentive compensation resulting from higher fee revenues, and $5.9 million largely related to vesting
assumptions regarding the company's earnings per share growth relative to a defined peer group.
These increases were offset partially by a $3.5 million increase in deferred compensation. Looking at the $2.3
million increase in non-personnel expense, there were several offsetting components. Write-downs on a set of oil
and gas properties and a retail commercial real estate property, professional fees and data processing expense
were partially offset by decreases in occupancy and equipment expense and other expenses. In addition, the
second quarter included a charitable contribution to the BOKF Foundation of $3 million.
On slide 14, our liquidity position remains very strong, given the continued inflow of deposit balances. Our loan-to-
deposit ratio is now 68% compared to 71% at June 30, providing significant on balance sheet liquidity to meet
future customer needs. Our capital position levels remain strong as well, with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of
12.1%, an improvement from 11.4% last quarter, and well ahead of our internal operating range minimum.
On slide 15, I'll leave you with some general outlook for the near- and mid-term that might be helpful. Our loan
growth is expected to be soft in the near-term. However, as we put together our budget with the expectation of
economic recovery, we'll be looking for opportunities to grow loan once again in 2021.
Our available for sale securities portfolio, which is largely agency mortgage-backed securities yielded 2.11%
during the third quarter, given the sustained low rate environment, prepayments could reach approximately $750
million per quarter. We can currently reinvest those cash flows at rates around 70 basis points to 90 basis points.
As we noted, we have had success during the third quarter driving deposit costs down further. We're now below
the low point reached during the last near zero rate environment. We believe there is room to push a bit floor over
the next couple of quarters, though we feel we are nearing a bottom to deposit cost. The combination on the
6

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
normalization of elevated discount accretion, pressure on asset yields and less room to lower deposit cost will put
some pressure on net interest margin.
Our diverse portfolio of fee revenue stream should continue to provide some mitigating impact to overall revenue
pressure being felt in the spread businesses. We expect our brokerage and trading activity to continue at elevated
levels, given our ability to monetize every part of the fixed income space.
Our mortgage business should remain solid from continued low rates and housing demand, with perhaps some
normal seasonal slowdown in the fourth quarter. Our disciplined approach to controlling personnel and non-
personnel cost will continue. As noted earlier, we've made good progress through the pandemic.
We have no plans for a direct reduction of workforce or any corporate-wide program to cut existing capabilities or
products for our customers. We will have our look for all opportunities to gain efficiency through automation and
process improvement. Although there remains uncertainty in the economic environment, we continue to believe
the loan loss reserve building is behind us.
As I mentioned a moment ago, we feel good about our capital strength. We will maintain our quarterly cash
dividends and have plans to restart opportunistic share buybacks.
I'll now turn the call back over to Steve Bradshaw for closing commentary.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Glen Bradshaw
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Thank you. The differentiator earnings outcome that our strict credit discipline and heavily fee-based revenue
model produces during times of uncertainty, can't be overstated here. As you've seen our fee income streams
have produced over $600 million in revenue so far this year, and we believe that strength will continue as we have
never seen clients with a higher appreciation for advice than in today's uncertain economy. Business owners,
mortgage holders, wealth management clients, corporations, all are facing significant financial decisions as they
plan for 2021.
Our relationship driven business model is really in the sweet spot between high touch and high tech, it is perfectly
in touch with the needs of clients today. We continue to expand existing relationships and acquire new customers,
as we believe individuals and companies are clearly evaluating how well their financial partners did or did not help
during the last eight months. BOK Financial is uniquely positioned to win incremental market share, and that will
be our focus heading into 2021.
With that, we are pleased to take your questions. Operator?

Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I guess my first – my first question is for Stacy. If you do seek positive credit migration in the fall redetermination
process as you expect, would that actually lead to a release of reserves, or is that already in your CECL
expectations?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
There's so many different assumptions that go into how – I mean, part of that would be what do our updated
economic outlook look like, what other credit migration may be happening in other aspects of the portfolio. I think,
it's difficult at this point to try to have conjecture around what we think positive credit migration would do to
reserve levels as we think about the fourth quarter. I think generally speaking, we – if you think about the
allowance, you probably want to get into some level of post-COVID or vaccine environment where you have a lot
more transparency around what the environment is going to look like, because you think it'd be difficult to try to do
something there and then have the economic environment turn against you. I think we feel very good about where
we are today, obviously, but I think it would be early to summarize what could happen with the positive credit
migration and energy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. It helps. And then in terms of the brokerage and trading side, obviously, your fee income guidance
implies the fees are going to remain strong. And I think, Steven, you mentioned that brokerage is going to remain
high. I guess that's been kind of going straight up over the last couple of quarters. It's been very strong results.
What is it about brokerage and trading that keeps it high at this level going forward?

Scott Bradley Grauer Q
Executive Vice President-Wealth Management & Chief Executive Officer-BOK Financial Securities Inc., BOK Financial Corp.
Hi Ken. This is Scott Grauer. So let me let me take a stab at that. We're – when you think about our trading and
brokerage activity, while we get probably a lot of headline attention to our mortgage-backed securities piece,
8


BOK Financial Corp.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
which is a significant component. It's roughly a third of that revenue. That being said, our activity with mortgage
originators is really only about – it's 25% or so. We've had real strong activity in our downstream correspondent
financial institution business. Our activity to asset managers has been very strong and then our other component
pieces, we've had significant momentum building in our CMO activity from a products standpoint. We've had good
activity with our investment banking, our municipal underwriting, and as Stacy mentioned, our hedging activity has
been very strong. So it's been really across the board in all of our activities in the brokerage and trading piece.
And our asset values have rebounded, since the recovery in the equity markets, our recurring fee business, which
is roughly 50/50, even on the brokerage side, are back to pre-March levels. So it's strong across the board.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Zerbe Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
All right, great. And just one really quick last question. In terms of your expense guidance, you said it's going to be
roughly at the same level sort of last few quarters. If I got my numbers right, it looks like expenses are kind of
going up quite a bit over the last few quarters. Are you talking more in line with 3Q or in line sort of with the
average, which is lower than 3Q?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Given the kind of change in revenue mix more towards the fee side relative to the spread businesses, you're just
going to have a slightly higher expense base to support that revenue stream. So I think going forward, you'll see
it's similar to what we had in the third quarter here. Ken, we did have one item where we caught up, if you will, our
incentive compensation accruals because of our positioning around where we fall within the peer group. So we
needed to catch that accrual up, but also we didn't put any dollars into our community foundation. And so we may
do that in the fourth quarter. You may not have the catch up on the incentive comp component for the stock-
based compensation, but you may have a little bit higher contribution to our foundation. So all those things may
wash out and end up at an expense level similar to what you had in the third quarter.

So I wanted to ask about share buybacks. It sounds like you guys will be active in that headed into year-end,
stocks at 1 times tangible. You have a decent amount of excess capital. I mean, I'm looking back at where you
9

guys have repurchased stock in the past. And it's over $80 a share, the stock now sub-60. So how aggressive do
you think you'll be on the buyback front this quarter and into next year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President,
Chief Financial Officer &
Director, BOK Financial
Corp.
Yeah. Well, you're exactly right. Brady, when I look back, the three quarters preceding the last two where we
didn't buy any stock back, and we averaged about 350,000 shares at $78. So you would have to expect we would
be as aggressive if not more, given the current stock price and given the capital levels, we're stronger now than
they were back then. And we feel pretty comfortable with the credit side as Stacy mentioned. So I think you would
expect us to be at that level or more aggressive in the fourth quarter. And then we'll just see where we roll out in
2021. I don't want to make any – provide any guidance around what we would do in 2021. But certainly, I think
you'll see us back in the market.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then moving on to the margin, I mean, you talked about seeing some pressure on the margin,
obviously, with the accretable yield from CoBiz normalizing. That will push the margin down on its own. But
excluding any sort of movements from accretable yield, how much pressure would you expect on the net interest
margin going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, let me just take a few of the components. I really think our loan pricing is kind of adjusted. I mean, I don't
expect that to be – to go down any further. Also, our lending groups, Stacy, Norm Bagwell, others have been able
to get some floors in on about 10% to 15% or so of our portfolio, and that's supporting the margins. So I feel pretty
good about where our loan pricing is. I mentioned deposit costs. I think we can push those down a little bit more. I
don't know how far, I wouldn't commit that we could pass through 20 basis points, but we're at [ph] 26 (00:28:00)
average for the third quarter. The last month of the quarter was a little better than that. I think we can keep
pushing there some. I think, where you'll see the margin pressure is from our available for sale securities portfolio
where you've got, as you would expect, some pretty sizable cash flows from that portfolio. I mentioned, I think
$750 million a quarter that will come out of a portfolio yield of [ph] 2.11 (00:28:29) and roll into securities that we
reinvest between 70 basis points and 90 basis points. So you can kind of do the math around that and figure out
that you've got some roll down in net interest margin in the next few quarters so that maybe I'll leave it at that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, that's helpful. And then finally for me, I just wanted to ask about the expense base. I'm guessing at some
point all the success you're having on the fee income side will start to decline so maybe next year, as you start to
see fees not be as strong, are there continued opportunities you have on the expense base to help offset any
pressure on profitability? I know you mentioned, you've already allowed the workforce to be reduced by 3%. Do
you think there's more work to be done on the expense side next year?

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
Yeah. Brady, this is Steve Bradshaw. I'd say that that's an absolute focus for us and it became significant for us
really going all the way back to mid-March, when we returned to a near zero paid environment, we understand the
implications of that. We have a playbook from that not to – in the not-too-distant past when we had the same
scenario. And you're right, we've used attrition to bring that workforce down. We've done some targeted
reductions, where we've seen efficiencies, currently doing that in our branch network. There's other areas that
we're focused on as well. So that is going to be critical, I think, for us in 2021.
And the good work we've done has been a little bit masked because to Steven's point, when you see outsized
performance from mortgage, you see outsized performance from brokerage and trading. Those are both
commission-based compensation businesses. You're going to pay for that. And we're happy to pay for that. And
that's going to be reflected in personnel costs. When you strip that away and we've got a very positive trend line in
reducing some of our costs in that fashion, if we're going to continue that into 2021. So it's not like we're just
waking up today to address that. This is something that we've been working on as a management team for seven
months.

Stacy for you, back on slide 9. Can you talk a little bit about how granular the energy non-accruals are and also
some of the potential problem loans? Is it a handful of larger credits or is it more broad-based than that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
No, I mean, energy overall tends to queue to a higher average loan size. And so, there is probably a higher
average loan size embedded in both potential problem loans, to a lesser extent than non-accruals generally, by
the time they make it that far, you've had a couple of borrowing base reductions and they tend to be a little bit
smaller by the time they get to that point. But, we're very optimistic about kind of at this fall redetermination
season. We feel good about potential loss content embedded here. We fared exceptionally well, if you look at I
think year-to-date, we're – last five quarters we've kind of been in that 27-basis-point range and that feels very
good, particularly given what we've been through. But even without that, that would be a good number for us. So I
feel good about kind of where we are from a loss content perspective there. Doesn't mean there won't be more. I

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
certainly would expect there to be some level of additional loss content embedded there as we work through
those problems. But we feel good about the outlook for sure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Okay, that helps. And then Steven, maybe another way of getting back at Ken's earlier question, but what
would have to happen to drive a higher provision or to get you back into positive territory? It seems like loan
balances are maybe a little flattish in the near-term and we've got some credit improvement. But what would have
to happen, you guys, to go back to a positive provision?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, I think, you'd have to have an economic outlook that deteriorates more than – we have a base case, upside
case and a downside case. And I think you would have to have much more the downside case out in expectation
for next year or early part of next year that would throw you back into a scenario where you needed to provide for
expected losses in a scenario like that. Perhaps some more deterioration on the energy side, but we're not seeing
that at this stage. So I think it really drives more around the economic outlook, backing up and deteriorating
significantly from what we have in our estimates today.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then one last small one, I don't know if you touched on it, but do you have the mortgage
pipeline and maybe how that looks today?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
No, I don't have that in front of me. I've got what the origination activity was third quarter versus second. It was
just slightly lower, not much but a little bit lower. There's always some seasonality, even in these very low rates
that have driven a lot of origination activity. You still have a slowdown in the fourth quarter generally, that's what
we've seen in the past. That's why I noted that we think mortgage will stay relatively strong, but with some
seasonal kind of slowdown. The margins have held up very, very well. In fact, they were up 2 basis points, all the
way to [ph] 367 (00:34:48), I believe, for this quarter. I don't know if that will hold up forever, but certainly, we're
seeing still very good activity in the mortgage company during the fourth quarter here.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Hi, Brandon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Hey. So most of my questions have been answered, but I wanted to touch on loan growth. And I saw that there
was growth in the healthcare, senior housing, and senior care. And I was wondering if you could provide more
details on underlying trends of that, and expectations for fourth quarter and possibly even in 2021?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
Sure. So healthcare has been an obviously a strong focus for our company for a long time. We've got a fantastic
team that's focused there. The two really three areas that we focus on are our hospital systems, and that's
generally large, high-end credit hospital systems, medical and physicians practice groups and senior housing.
And we see opportunity for growth really, particularly in the latter two. We saw growth in hospital systems in the
first half of the year, as they worked to obtain additional liquidity to work through the pandemic. I think what we
would expect to see over the next year or so is that need lessens that there need for liquidity would lessen, and
so their need for credit would probably lessen as well or at least their draw downs. We see good opportunity
inside of our healthcare group, both the medical and physicians group as well as the senior housing group.
I think that what we've seen in the growth in the near-term has been, as we've talked about in the past, some of
the large REITs that have struggled, may divest of certain property sets, and so we have some clients who are
the operators of those properties, and maybe they sold them their REIT originally many years ago. They continue
to operate them. They know the facility. They know the health dynamics of that facility. So they're very
comfortable purchasing that facility out of the REIT. And so that's created some opportunities for growth from us
with existing clients, with existing properties that they operate. And so that's been part of the growth that we've
seen here in the third quarter. And we think, particularly once we get through the pandemic, that will continue to
be a very strong opportunity for growth for us, and we're very happy with our growth in our medical and physicians
practice group. We really – that was a big part of the acquisition from CoBiz for us on the healthcare front, and
they really exceeded expectations and continued to have high expectations from that team as we move forward.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brandon King Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Awesome. And other than healthcare, are there any other areas of growth that you could be looking to capitalize
on going into next year? I know loan demand is pretty soft right now, but are there any particular areas outside of
healthcare that you could be looking to take any market share opportunity there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-
Corporate Banking, BOK
Financial Corp.
Look, I think that from our perspective growth will be tempered until such time is people are very comfortable in
the economic environment. And I think that probably is into a widely available vaccine. But I will tell you, I think
that the response that we've seen from our customer base around our customer service and responsiveness,
particularly around PPP, I think our opportunities to grow in all aspects of our lending, once the economy begins
to grow. I mean, if we were growing loans in a big way right now, you guys would probably be questioning and
13

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
challenging how we were doing that and where that growth was coming from. But I think when the economy turns,
we're exceptionally well-positioned, because our customers have realized that having a trusted advisor and
having a person they can talk to, when they need credit and when they need to work through an issue is worth a
lot to them. And so, I'm very optimistic about our growth prospects, once we get to the kind of proverbial other
side of this pandemic.

Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks, guys. Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A

Good morning.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gary Peter Tenner Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
I wanted to ask a question on energy, and I appreciate the positive comments regarding the upcoming
redetermination season. But I was curious in terms of borrowers that may have had shortfalls after the spring
redetermination, how successful have they been in correcting those? Or is really maybe some increase in the
borrowing base in the fall going to be the more positive driver of that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, I mean it's hard to answer that because we've probably only been through about 15% to 20% of the
redeterminations at this point. And so in many cases, the last time we saw them was in the spring when the prices
were significantly lower. In the meantime, they've done things to manage their business, reduce costs. In some
cases, they've shut in wells, in the early stages that they'll bring back online. So I think it's a little bit premature to
answer that with a lot of clarity until we've been through this fall redetermination cycle. But based on the credits
that we have seen through that process, I think we're optimistic that between a positive price movement and
actions of the borrower that we're going to work through this in a very positive manner. And we don't see lost
content in that portfolio, that's inconsistent with what you've seen from us in the past.

Okay, thank you. And then just on PPP, unless I missed it in the press release anywhere. Can you tell us what the
fees were – that were recognized in the third quarter?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yes, Gary. This is Steven. The fees were $11.3 million that we recognized in the third quarter for PPP.

Please proceed with your questions.

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.

Hi, Peter.
[indiscernible] (00:41:30)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Obviously, credit is a good story. I was just wondering if you could give a little bit more color on the retail side that
you guys called out that you are watching a little bit more closely.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Stacy C. Kymes A
Executive Vice President-Corporate Banking, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. I'd certainly invite Marc to provide color here as well. Today, we're not seeing real big issues there. We're
calling in it out as a risk area because it's intuitive, and we see that from that perspective. But I think in my
comments, I mentioned that it's held up better than we would have expected, knowing what we know now and
given the depth of the pandemic in various markets. So, we're not necessarily seeing credit migration there today
as much as we are calling it out as a potential risk area. In fact, as we dig through that and as you can imagine,
15


BOK Financial Corp.
(BOKF) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2020 Earnings Call 21-Oct-2020
we've spent a lot of time in the last 90 days doing that and we actually feel much better about it than we did when
this all kind of started and we began to kind of call out some of these higher risk areas.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marc C. Maun A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah. This is Marc. What I'd only add is that from a loan deferral standpoint, we've had two-thirds of our
consumer loans and mortgage loan exit from that deferral program. So – and they tend to have a little longer
request and a little longer ability than most. So, we've had very good success in having those migrate back to
regular payments.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Got it. And then if I can just confirm on the provision expense outlook, Steven. So the way to think about it is kind
of a zero provision for the next several quarters, assuming no further deterioration in the economy?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven E. Nell A
Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Well, that's kind of what we see. I mean, I – we've made the statement that we feel like the reserve build is behind
us. We made that statement last quarter that if the economic environment stayed relatively stable, which it did, in
fact it improved a little bit that we've felt like we wouldn't have to build a reserve anymore. That's kind of the
stance we have. Now, who knows what will change. And I answered the question earlier in this call that if the
economic environment and outlook deteriorate significantly, then yeah we got to go back and run our models and
determine if there's more expected loss there. But today, we're not seeing that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just my final question for Steve. I was just wondering if you can give an update on what your thoughts
are of M&A, bank M&A in this environment?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Glen Bradshaw A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, BOK Financial Corp.
Yeah, Peter. I don't think our stance really changes there. We're always interested in quality organizations,
especially areas that we can expand within our existing footprint. As you know, we like the market that we're in
very much. We've got some good growth markets where we don't have substantial market share and we could
benefit from extra scale.
I think realistically in this environment high-quality banks are not as likely to be sellers with the uncertain credit
outlook, with the low rates and maybe [ph] calling (00:44:49) margins. If you were an owner of a good quality
bank, you probably don't see that as the greatest opportunity to maximize the value of your bank. You're probably
going to see more scratch and dent type transactions. And while we look at those from time to time, we've
typically not gone down that route because our belief – and I say this with confidence and not arrogance is that I'd
rather have the management team focused on growing our own organization, which we've had great success
doing and trying to turn around a bad situation in an uncertain environment. So we remain interested and focused
on that as we think about going forward, but I think that the opportunity that we have will probably be limited here
in near-term.
