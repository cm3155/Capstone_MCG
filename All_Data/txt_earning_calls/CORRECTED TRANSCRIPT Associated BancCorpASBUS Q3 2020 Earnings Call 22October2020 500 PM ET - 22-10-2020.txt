Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
Philip B. Flynn
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Thank you, and welcome to our third quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are Chris Niles, our Chief
Financial Officer; and Pat Ahern, our Chief Credit Officer. Those love saying that this has been a challenging and
unusual year; we pivoted in March in response to the pandemic and have been retooling our delivery channels
since to best meet our customers' needs. We deployed ourselves to seamlessly interact through virtual channels
and I've seen an accelerating shift to mobile and online banking. With a likely very low interest rate environment
facing us for an extended period; it became critical to respond in areas we can control. Let's start with the actions
we took during the third quarter.
On slide 2, we have detailed our optimization efforts and the restructuring of our securities and real estate lending
subsidiaries. During the third quarter, we announced the sale and planned consolidation of 22 of our branches.
We also announced the strategic streamlining of several corporate, managerial and back office functions. As a
result of these actions, we incurred $16 million of pre-tax charges in Q3, but we expect these changes to drive a
$40 million per year reduction in our run rate expenses as we move into this quarter and 2021.
We also deployed about half of our excess liquidity position to repay $950 million of FHLB advances. This
prepayment resulted in a $45 million Q3 pre-tax expense. However, we expect this to improve annualized net
interest income by $20 million beginning in Q4 2020 continuing through 2021 with diminishing but continuing
savings through 2022 and into 2023. Finally, we were able to unlock capital losses through the restructuring of our
securities and real estate lending subsidiaries, and this resulted in a $49 million after tax benefit during the
quarter.
Turning to slide 3, we've highlighted the impact of our Q3 initiatives on our pre-tax pre-provision income. Adjusting
for the $60 million of restructuring and prepayment costs, third quarter PTPP would have been $90 million.
On slide 4, we've provided a walk forward of EPS, which breaks down the various initiatives executed during the
quarter. You'll notice when tax affected the one-time costs of our efficiency initiatives were more than covered by
the tax benefits we realized from the reorganization of our subsidiaries. If you were to exclude both the
restructuring charges and the tax benefits from our EPS for the third quarter, the adjusted $0.24 result is within
$0.02 of our reported GAAP EPS of $0.26. So in effect, the items largely offset each other. The actions this
quarter were net additive to our tangible book value.
Turning to slide 5, average loan balance trends are shown. Total average loans came in at $25 billion, down
slightly from the prior quarters' average. Commercial real estate grew $312 million driven by the continuing
funding of construction loans. And at September 30, we still had $1.9 billion of unfunded commercial real estate
commitments. Commercial and business lending on the other hand declined by $271 million on average as our
general commercial customers largely use their increased excess liquidity balances to pay-down open lines of
credit.
Turning to slide 6, we highlight changes in the end of period loan balances. Period end loans were up $171 million
or 1% for the quarter driven again by strong growth in commercial real estate lending, which was up $298 million.
Mortgage activity remains strong which was reflected in our elevated mortgage warehouse lending balances at
quarter end. Power and utilities lending along with commercial real estate, construction and industrial loans have
continued to grow throughout 2020.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
I'll also call out oil and gas, which declined nearly a $100 million during Q3 and now represents only 1.3% of our
total loan portfolio. Consumer lending balances came down during the quarter driven by refinancing activity and
our decision to sell $70 million of prepayments susceptible mortgages.
Now, let me provide an update on our deferral programs. On slide 7, you can see our commercial deferrals have
continued to steadily decline. As of October 19, we have approximately $227 million of active commercial loan
deferrals down 73% from June. Our commercial deferrals have largely rolled off their initial 90-day terms and the
remaining deferrals are primarily related to COVID-impacted portfolios. Commercial real estate loan deferrals
were $182 million of that $227 million and are primarily related to hotel and retail borrowers.
Commercial and business lending deferrals have declined to just $45 million at October 19 and they now
comprise less than 1% of the commercial and business loan book. Taken together, the $227 million of active
commercial and commercial real estate deferrals at October 19 make up about 1.4% of our total commercial
loans outstanding.
Our consumer related COVID relief efforts are highlighted on slide 8. In the beginning of the pandemic, we
granted deferrals to virtually any customers who ask for assistance. The deferrals granted were for six months.
So, the bulk of those deferrals began to expire during September. At October 19, we had $269 million of active
deferrals down 63% from June.
These loans now represent approximately 3% of outstanding consumer loan balances. It's important to note
however that of the remaining $269 million of active deferrals, $263 million of that is still on their first deferral
period. The bulk of those deferrals will expire during the balance of October and we expect most will not require
additional assistance. So of those loans that have come off deferral in the consumer book at this point only $6
million have asked for additional assistance.
Among consumers whose deferrals have ended, 97% are current or less than 30 days past due. The trends we're
seeing is deferrals roll off continue to be positive and we feel confident many of these borrowers will go back to
their pre-COVID performance.
On slide 9, we've provided an allowance update. We utilized the Moody's September 2020 baseline forecast for
our CECL forward-looking assumptions. The baseline forecast assumes additional stimulus, continuing low rates,
[ph] and a COVID (00:09:05) vaccine that becomes widely available in Q2 of 2021.
For Q3 of 2020, our net allowance build was only $13 million down from $35 million in the prior quarter. I'll direct
you to the top right chart where we illustrate the ACLL trend during 2020. You can see our net reserve build has
tapered off throughout the year. This reflects the overall stability of our loan portfolio and our real time outlook for
all our credit exposures at quarter end. As you can see from the lower table on this page, during Q3, we actually
released reserves in four lending categories and added reserves in three. The largest net build was in our
commercial real estate investor portfolio where we added to our reserves related to shopping malls and other
retailer exposures. Reserves on our oil and gas portfolio declined $33 million as we continued to manage that
portfolio down. As of September 30, our total allowance was $442 million and covered 1.8% of total loans.
Credit metrics are presented on slide 10. As a reminder, these metrics reflect our real time risk rating and credit
evaluations with the expectation that substantially all the active deferral activity will come to some conclusion or
remediation this quarter. Potential problem loans decreased $14 million, primarily driven by the migration of
COVID affected loans to non-accrual. Overall non-accrual loans increased $60 million driven primarily by the
migration of two commercial real estate mall-oriented REITs and our only sand fracking company into non-

accrual. Loans included in our key COVID commercial exposures made up 37% of non-accrual loans at the end
of Q3. This inflow was partially offset by non-accrual oil and gas loans, which declined $42 million due to charge-
offs, note sales, and payoffs. Charge-offs for the quarter were $30 million outside of oil and gas and net charge-
offs were again less than $10 million for the quarter. Reserves on the remaining oil and gas book remain over
15%.
Turning to slide 11, average deposits were $26.8 billion, up nearly $700 million or 3% over the second quarter.
Average deposit growth again came from low cost savings and checking accounts this quarter. Liquidity remains
high and our deposit mix continues to improve. Low cost deposits accounted for nearly 63% of our balances at
the end of the third quarter.
Turning to slide 12, third quarter net interest income was $182 million with a net interest margin of 2.31%. We
previously guided that net interest margin would bottom out during Q3 and begin to pick up in Q4. And as we
expected, margin hit bottom in July and August and then rebounded up to 2.35% in September. Asset yields
stabilized during the third quarter, while our liability costs trended downward. We continue to expect to see margin
expansion further into Q4 and into 2021. We expect spreads to widen on our LIBOR based commercial loans as
we continue to implement new LIBOR floors into our new and renewing loans. This will happen over time or in
conjunction with other repricing or credit actions including the anticipated migration to SOFR and other indices
later in 2021.
On the liability side, our time deposit levels have both been declining and repricing lower. When CDs renew or roll
over today, they're generally repricing from approximately 1.2% to below 15 basis points. We expect this repricing
to provide margin lift going into 2021. Additionally, we'll see a full quarter impact during Q4 from the prepayment
of our FHLB advances. And we expect this will provide a $5 million benefit to net interest margin in the fourth
quarter and about a $20 million improvement in 2021.
Turning to slide 14, second quarter non-interest income came in at $76 million, non-interest income was lower in
Q3 than Q2. However, this was driven by the large gain from the sale of associated benefits and risk consulting in
Q2 and of course the lack of revenue from ABRC going forward. Service charges and deposit account fees came
in at $14 million, an increase of nearly $3 million quarter-over-quarter, card based fees increased 15% from the
second quarter up to $10 million. So, the combination of COVID relief, winding down as well as more normalized
economic activity is driving these fee lines.
Our mortgage banking activity remains strong this quarter with nearly $600 million of mortgages sold to the
agencies, generating $13 million in net fee revenue. After $17 million of MSR impairment in the first half of the
year, impairment for the third quarter was just over $1 million. We expect positive fee trends heading into Q4.
On slide 14, we highlight our expenses and third quarter came in at $228 million, including $60 million of
restructuring costs previously mentioned. Core expenses continued to trend lower largely driven by the reduction
of expense following the sale of ABRC. We expect the expense initiatives executed in Q3 to provide further
savings as we move into 2021. And as you can see from the lower right chart on an adjusted or run rate basis,
our expenses to average assets ratio is already trending below 2%.
As shown on slide 15, our regulatory capital levels remain strong. At the end of Q3, our regulatory capital levels
were at or above where we ended the year for 2019, and our tangible common equity ratio increased 25 basis
points to 7.5%. Tangible book value per share also increased to $16.37 per share, up from $16.21 in the prior
quarter, reflecting the net added benefit to shareholders of the actions we took during the quarter.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
On slide 16, we are updating select items for the remainder of 2020 and reiterating our expense guidance for
2021. We expect a net interest margin of 2.5% or slightly higher in the fourth quarter. We expect fee revenue to
continue on a positive trend through the end of 2020. Expenses for Q4 are expected to come in at $175 million
including about $3 million of remaining restructuring costs. We reiterate our full-year 2021 expenses are expected
to be approximately $685 million, the full-year 2020 tax rate will be in the low to mid-single digits, and we expect
the full-year 2021 tax rate to be between 15% and 17%.
Thank you. With that, we'd be happy to answer your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will conduct our question-and-answer session.
[Operator Instructions] One moment please while we pole for questions. Our first question comes from Michael
Young with Truist Securities. Please state your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities
Hey, thanks for taking the question. Wanted to ask about loan growth. You mentioned commercial construction
pipeline – I think you said $1.9 billion yet to be funded. So it sounds like that's a pretty nice tailwind or potential
bridge to return to stronger loan growth. Is that the right way to think about that or there's some other offsets that
that we should be thinking of in some of the other commercial categories.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah, thanks, Michael. So, yes, certainly commercial real estate as you've seen throughout the year will continue
to provide loan growth based upon the backlog we have, and there is some amount of new business being done
in that area as well. Our specialty areas, our utilities, the mortgage warehouse business continue to show good
growth and we expect certainly the power and utilities area to keep growing. Mortgage warehouse will depend
upon refinance activity. The mortgage business still has some tailwind and we may choose to retain some of our
mortgage production going forward. General commercial lending probably somewhat slow, we don't have great
visibility into that line item into next year yet, but we expect to have more information on that as we get through
the fourth quarter and get to the January call. So, there are certain areas that continue to show good growth.
There are areas that continue to have the backlog like CRE that will fund up. But general activity in the
commercial lending space need to show some more growth going forward, and we'll see what happens as we go
along.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities
Okay. And just maybe on a core basis as we're thinking about the margin for next year is really kind of loan
growth the main driving factor to upside from kind of what you've already talked about in terms of just the funding
costs coming down?

So, we expect our liabilities to continue to [ph] grind (00:19:25) lower. We took the actions on the FHLB
prepayment, which is a significant improvement to NII next year. We are getting decent traction on closing floors
on our LIBOR based loans, which is the bulk of our loans. We'll continue to work on that. So, the combination of
[ph] grinding (00:19:45) liability cost down, the FHLB pre-payment, LIBOR floors, and then transitioning to new
indices should provide stable to growing NIM as we look forward. But we'll have better guidance for you in
January on that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities
Okay. And if I could just sneak-in one last one, just on the commercial deferrals, I understand obviously those
have come down a good bit. But I guess are there some that have been modified, is there a large portion that's
maybe paying interest only or some other modification has been made that's maybe not captured in that deferral
number?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So, we're down to 1.4% of the total commercial and commercial [Technical Difficulty] (00:20:29) that have
requested some additional deferral. Pat, do you have a little more color on that for Michael?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. I would say on the commercial book, it's really case-by-case how we're looking at those. There's definitely a
mix where we've got clients that have moved to maybe an interest-only. We have some hotel – the hotel industry
obviously is going to need some more time. So those modifications are a little more customized to kind of bridge
them for at least the next year plus. So there's a lot of nuances that kind of go with each credit from that
standpoint.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities
Is there an amount that's just been modified? I mean would it be – would it closely match kind of that initial $800
million or is it more like $600 million. I don't know if there's any way to kind of ballpark that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, the modified loans, Pat, correct me if I'm wrong are included in the $227 million that you see, Michael.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Michael Young Q
Analyst, Truist Securities
Right. Okay.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
The bulk of those have rolled off and don't need any further assistance or modification.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. First one, hopefully, it's a pretty basic one. I'm just – given
all the moving parts I just want to make sure I understand sort of what you guys think the run rate cost base is in
the third quarter. So, I'm just trying to square with on slide 14 with the commentary in the text. So if we just take
the $109 million and $69 million that would give us somewhere around $178 million in core expenses. So you
have the $15 million of restructuring costs, which I think is the FHLB as well as the real estate. Where exactly do
the $10 million of severance costs. Where do we see that those...
[indiscernible] (00:22:32)
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
That $10 million is embedded in that $109 million. So you can take it out of there too, Scott.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. Okay. Perfect. So then we're talking about a core number of somewhere in like $167 million range. Is that a
fair way – fair approximation?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
For that quarter, yes.

[indiscernible] (00:22:59) moving parts really.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah. And then more just a top level one on how this credit cycle kind of plays out. It seems like every 90 days we
sort of push out the time so we see more accelerated loss migration I guess with the benefit of a at least a bit
more clarity of vis-à-vis say 90 days ago. Phil maybe how are you thinking about when we should expect losses
to begin to accelerate at some point in 2021? Is that like a mid or even later 2021 event or how are you guys
preparing for things?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
It's always hard to tell. You can see that our reserve build is moderating to being pretty flattish at this point.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
I think so much depends on is there more stimulus, what's the economy look like as we get into next year. But
there's a – from here there's probably putting aside oil and gas. But from here you've probably a couple three
quarters out before you kind of push this lump of troubled credits through the pipeline and see what comes out.
So I think there's a lag to go. And of course we saw in our oil and gas that we've done I think a good job of
winding that down and getting that behind us. So we still have the fall redetermination period to come. We're
about a third of the way through that without any issues. But we're still holding significant reserves in the event
that we have on additional troubled credits there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Good afternoon, guys. On your capital slide you typically prioritize your usage for excess capital. I didn't see it
this quarter. I was wondering if you could kind of run through how you're thinking about excess capital specifically
the buyback just given where the share price is relative to tangible book value.

Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. So that – leaving out the chart question that we haven't changed our level of priorities, but it is more than
fair to say when we're trading at a discount to book, which frankly we don't understand why we are given all of our
actions and given our outlook. But when we're trading at that type of level share buybacks certainly become
interesting to us. It's probably still a little bit early, but as we get into next year, Terry, clearly as we sit with
growing capital and depending on where we're trading at, share buybacks become of great interest.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks. And then just as a follow-up, the $1 billion plus of retail and shopping centers. How much of that is just
what I call typical – your typical mall, which has- may have been struggling pre-COVID. And if we just haven't
seen charge-offs at all just for the whole bank, what are your thoughts there in terms of when the deferrals run
out. What's the most susceptible? Is it that traditional mall, and if so how big is the portfolio and do you have any
kind of stats, average LTV or something like that to give us some color on the portfolio?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. Pat, do you want to give some color on the mall-based stuff...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Patrick E. Ahern A
Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. In general, the stuff that we're seeing that continues to struggle is all going to be in closed mall kind of
space where you just with the social distancing et cetera people are struggling to get into. Our – majority of our
retailers are in that what I'll call neighborhood strip center mall, net lease space. And those have all seen rent
collections come back almost to normal levels 85% 90%. Lot of those have come off deferral. So we feel pretty
good about them. There's still a handful that we're dealing with. And then in terms of we really only have a handful
one or two maybe other in closed mall exposures to public REIT that have been so far those remaining ones have
been performing well other than the two Phil mentioned earlier the non-accrual. So, right now, we feel pretty – we
have a pretty good trajectory on the retail client base.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Can you talk a little bit about the timing of the expense reductions for the branch optimization project? How we
should roll that in?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. So, the consolidations internal will be done this quarter. The sales in Peoria and of two branches in
Southwest Wisconsin will complete this quarter. We expect them to complete this quarter. And the remaining one
branch, which we're selling to a third-party will close sometime in the first quarter. So, you should expect to see
everything clean starting January 1 with a very minor exception of one branch.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Yeah. And so, the message is similar to your commentary on net interest income with the $5 million. You're
saying it could be as simple as just putting an extra $10 million, taking $10 million out of expenses for Q1, is that
fair?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, Chris, what's the – I think we have all the charges through in the fourth quarter right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Correct. Yes. So as you said 2021 should be a clean from January 1. So, Jon, I think you're thinking it as the right
way.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, okay. Good. Thank you for that. Any comments on a service charge rebound, the magnitude of what you
expect or is that just, I know there's a bit of a bounce back but any commentary there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So, we expect to see continued growth there as you know at the start of the pandemic, we gave quite a bit
of relief to customers. That is now completely rolled off as we get into Q4. And rightly or wrongly economic activity
has picked up particularly in the Wisconsin footprint, and so we're seeing more activity there as well. So in our
guidance that we expect to see fee income continuing to grow into the fourth quarter is based on those factors.

Okay. And then one more and maybe not an easy question, but you've had some really good deposit growth in
the last few quarters, and do you all think about how much of this might be permanent versus temporary if things
return to normal?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Chris, do you have a view on that you want to express?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah. So, Jon, I think if you'd asked us a couple of quarters ago certainly we would have said – we saw it all
surge. As we sit here moving into October and the balances have stayed through the entire third quarter, they're
staying as we sit, as we move into the fourth quarter, we're starting to feel [indiscernible] (00:30:49) lot stickier
which is part of the reason we are comfortable repaying the $950 million of federal home loan bank advances
because we think a good portion of this is sticky and the dollars that were still continues to see come in we think
will continue to be sticky as we move forward. So as we sit here today, it feels a lot stickier than we would have
expected and it feels like we have room to move things around.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. All right. Thanks for the help guys.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris McGratty with KBW. Please state your question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi. This is actually Kelly Motta in for Chris. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess you talked a lot about what
you've done on the funding side with prepaying that FHLB borrowings, and [ph] you're still repricing these lower
(00:31:41). Just wondering if you can give us color on reinvestment yields of securities and how new loan yields
compared to what you have on book right now?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Okay. Chris, you want to handle that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher J. Del Moral-Niles A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Associated Banc-Corp
Sure. So on the reinvestment securities I think one of the things to keep in mind is we're not aggressively growing
the balances. And so, what you're seeing here is essentially relatively stable levels to what you'll see reported for
this third quarter averages and not a lot of net movement because of incremental significant investment activity.
So, I don't expect you to see the continuing drift downward because there just isn't a lot of net new that we're
expecting to put into that portfolio.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 22-Oct-2020
On the commercial loans, I think we showed the trends on the slides. And again, we've tried to highlight monthly
trends. So, if you take a look at the slide page 12, you'll notice that commercial loan yields actually bottomed in
June. As for the commercial and business lending, and we've been working with the business on spreads and
floors in order to sort of bounce that back up a few basis points and hold that line above 250 basis points on the
commercial booking as a whole over the last several quarters. And that seems to have gone successfully and that
reflects the activity we're doing on new. You can also see the commercial real estate has held steady. And again
what we're holding in portfolio is holding steady on the residential book as well. So, I think those month-to-month
trend line give you a good indication as to where the new volume coming in.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Great. Thank you. And then last question for me on tax rate with potentially tax rate is going up again from
Washington. Is there any differences on how we should think about it or is kind of looking at it what happened in
2018, so kind of a valid proxy? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Well, okay, your guess on what happens is as good as ours. But our best guess right now is that we've got tax
rates in that 15% to 17%-ish range. But that can all change.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kelly Motta Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Philip B. Flynn A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Associated Banc-Corp
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
