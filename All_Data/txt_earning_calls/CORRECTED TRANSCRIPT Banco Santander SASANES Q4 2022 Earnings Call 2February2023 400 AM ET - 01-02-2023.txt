I'm joined here today by our Executive Chair, Ms. Ana Botín; and our CEO, Mr. Héctor Grisi. Following their
presentations, we will open the floor for any and all questions you may have in the Q&A session.
Before I hand over the floor to Ms. Botín, let me remind you that, on February 28, Santander Investor Day will
take place in London, where our top management team will present the group's strategy and mid-term outlook
and plans. You can find all relevant information on how to register on our corporate website in case you have not
done so already. We look forward to your participation.
And, with this, I will hand over to Ms. Botín. Ana, the floor is yours.

Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea
Group Executive Chair, Banco Santander SA
So, thank you, Begoña, and good morning to everybody. Thanks for joining us. So 2022 was marked by the tragic
return of war to Europe. It has not been an easy year and, certainly, very different to what we all expected 12
months ago.
Clearly, this has impacted, in a big way, the economic and macroenvironment. I believe we're in a new era that
these conditions of high inflation and higher rates will be here for a while. Central Bank is, of course, tightening
monetary policy, increased rates. Remember, we had six years of negative rates in Europe and quite a few years
in the US.
The result of all of this is that we have a lot more uncertainty, and Santander has shown, with the results we
published today, that we're well-prepared to deal with this. We're actually quite accustomed to dealing in
inflationary environments for many years, including the last ones, of course, in Latin America. We delivered record
results – and I want to stress – and achieved our 2022 commitments that we set before the war in Ukraine
started. This is thanks to our customer focus, our scale, both in market and global. And this is what's driving the
profitable growth that you have seen.
We actually increased loans by and deposits by nearly €140 billion. We welcomed 7 million new customers to the
bank. We increased revenues and profits by double-digit. This is a record profit. And I want to stress also that
most of this increase is driven by the improvements in the operational model that we have been executing. And
profitability, of course, increased again with a RoTE of 13.4% and a strong EPS growth of 23% in the year.
Last but not least, we continue to strengthen the balance sheet, not just capital but our overall balance sheet. So
let me give you some details of that. If you look at the income statement, you can see continued progress in the
execution of our strategy reflected in the revenue growth. I said already that this is a lot to do with more
customers and more volumes.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 02-Feb-2023
There is also some impact from higher rates, especially in Europe and North America. And as you've seen in Q4,
this will continue into the new year. Net interest income rose 16%, improving quarter-on-quarter. We increased
fee income; very importantly, fee income supported by our global businesses, i.e., by our global scale businesses,
by payments and increasing network benefits across our geographies.
We managed to grow our costs below inflation in all regions, improving the efficiency ratio. And the focus on
improving operational performance led to a record net operating income of €28 billion. This is equivalent to 2.7%
of loans.
We are proud of the sustainability and the low volatility of our results across the cycle. This is something, which is
not new, but it's really important to highlight why this happens. This happens because 95% of total revenues is net
interest income on fees. This compares with 80% in our global peers. And this is incredibly important because of
the sustainability of our results and the quality of our results.
We really believe that, again, in challenging times our model is better and the cost of risk ended the year at just
under 1% as per our target, which we set in January of last year. And this all results, of course, in the record
profits – attributable profit of €9.6 billion.
Héctor Grisi, who is here with me, our new CEO, will give you more details about all this later.
So I want to now focus on our shareholders. The increased profitability – and this is not new. This has happened
year after year, with the exception of COVID, allowed us to increase shareholder value creation. Our RoTE of
13.4% was exceeding our year-end target, exceeding our European peers profitability. And as I said, this is on the
back of both strong profit growth but also the reduced number of shares following the buybacks of about 5%.
Our earnings per share grew 23%, which again is ahead of our peers. We delivered 6% growth in shareholder
value creation, even with a negative impact this year from interest rates, which affected the balance sheet. And, of
course, part of this has already begun to reverse in January. If we exclude this temporary impact, growth would
have been close to 10%.
We expect a 16% increase in cash DPS against 2022 results. In the next few weeks, we will announce the
second dividend, which will include again cash and buybacks. And at current prices, share buybacks, we believe,
are still one of the most effective ways to generate shareholder value. In the last two years, as I said, we've
repurchased 5% of outstanding shares. This doesn't include the one we will be announcing soon, and the return
on investment is about 18% for our shareholders.
So just looking at our balance sheet, and I think here it's important to give the message that we – this is a holistic
management of the balance sheet. Capital, of course, is important, but so is credit and liquidity. And the overall
risk profile, including credit, remains medium low. It has, once again, proven to be predictable based on our
diversification and the control we have over our portfolios, delivering on the guidance we set 12 months ago. And
the NPL ratio improved, cost of risk in line with target.
Liquidity, extremely important for us. We have a very conservative position. It's not just that the balance sheet
remains funded by very high quality liabilities based on stable customer retail deposits in core markets where
we're market leaders or top three, it's also that our liquidity ratios remain well above requirements, and this is
even after the TLTRO accelerated repayments. As you can see, the LCR ratio stood at 152% in December.

And last but not least, we again delivered on what we said at the beginning of this year of having our CET1 above
12% every quarter. Our capital performance this year was better than many of our peers. Our capital levels have
again shown the strength of our model. They were the – maybe amongst the least volatile in the latest European
banking stress test.
Very importantly, we have continued to be very disciplined in how we allocate our capital and we have reached
the target we set the year ago of keeping profitability of 80% of RWAs above cost of equity. This compares with
70% last year and improved the front book RoRWA – this is really important – to 2.6%. The back book is at
1.77%. So if you ask me what is the biggest progress we've made this year is really leveraging what is unique
about Santander, which is that we have both in-market scale and global scale in large markets with growth
potential. And again, these numbers show the success and the strength of our model and our strategy.
Firstly, now in-market scale in each of our core markets, here you have it run by lending. It's a strong competitive
advantage. We're among the top three lenders in 9 out of our 10 core markets. In the US, we have an at-scale US
auto business that benefits from the network, Santander network, in terms of OEM relationships.
And compared to our local peers, we are already leaders in profitability in 4 out of these 10 markets and
[indiscernible] (00:09:19) in Brazil, we've been number one in profitability in two of the last four years. But really,
where the biggest opportunity lies is in that our global reach on a global scale, and divisions like CIB, corporate
investment banking, our wealth management.
I'll tell you about this now in a few minutes. And further, leveraging our auto and payments capabilities generates
a differential revenue and growth – profitable growth opportunities. And these four segments – and this is
important – today represent more than 30% of total group revenue; in 2022, 30%, these four divisions, of total
group revenue, and over 50% of the profit. Much of which would not be possible without this collaboration and
network that Santander provides. We will explain more about this in Investor Day.
But just to share with you what we've done this year, because we've been working on this not just in 2022 but
before that. So, again, this in-market scale in each of our geographies has proven that it's a key competitive
advantage. Héctor will cover that in more detail and we're still working on that, by the way, but our global scale is
already providing us with this value-added network, which is unique, a unique combination, and let me just share
some examples.
The best example this year, as I say, the proof is in the pudding, is Santander Corporate Investment Banking. We
are leaders in Latin America. We've built a strong franchise in Europe and we're strengthening our position in the
US.
We're recognized as global leaders and have been in the top three over the last 10 years in businesses related to
energy transition and infrastructure, both of which are expected to grow in a significant way in the next few years.
Here, we have got not just in our footprint but globally. We've created a global network for CIB customers that
generates revenue that local countries cannot generate alone, and this cross-border collaboration revenue, not
achievable by local banks and which we measure – we've measured for several years – was €3.4 billion in 2022
and represents 50% of CIB total revenue and is growing at 33% last year.
Again, this is a differential performance versus our peers. There's no other bank that has this combination of
being very strong in-market and very strong in certain verticals globally. So we've outperformed peers, as you can
see, in revenue and profit growth, efficiency and profitability.

The other global division that has made huge progress the last few years is Wealth Management. This is a very
high return business. We're executing on – same as we've done for CIB for the last few years on our global
platform plans. And again, already we have a better efficiency ratio compared to peers. What we are doing in
terms of private banking services to our customers that purely local banks cannot provide by connecting the
service to our private banking customers we brought in more than €51 billion of AUMs.
And again, 2022 was not an easy year for this business. Our revenue growth and our profitability outperformed
both in private banking and asset management. And last one would be insurance, where we have achieved gross
written premiums, growth of almost double our peers.
We have two other network businesses that are really increasingly being used by the countries. And just very
briefly to say that even though this is not a global division, we are actually a worldwide leader in auto financing.
We are clearly number one in Europe in terms of both volumes and profitability. We've built – we are building
proprietary platforms with a competitive edge leasing, subscription, buy-now-pay-later, digital tools for our OEM
partners. And our US auto business is already benefiting from this competitive edge.
We've started to replicate this model in South America, building common tech to deploy leasing activities and
other products. This is not the only network effect, but let me just focus on the global relationships with OEMs,
and our knowledge of this business means that, for example, in Chile and Mexico we went from no presence to
about 15 market share in just three years. And in Mexico – congratulations, Héctor, by the way, we broke even in
March 2022.
But the key number is that, today, around 40% of our business in the Americas is related to our OEMs
partnerships in Europe. This business would not be available to local auto finance companies.
In payments, we manage 97 million cards globally. This would make us one of the top banks or the top three or
top four banks in the world by number of cards. And, of course, customers that have a card tend to do more
business with the bank.
We're expanding our merchant capabilities, again, our acquiring business, Getnet was ranked among the top
three merchant acquirers in Latin America. Getnet, again, has rapidly grown in Mexico. As we left our third party
provider, we moved from a market share of 14% in 2020 to 20% in 2022.
And as you know, this is a key product to engage our customers and be able to do more business in the bank.
We're currently number two by total payment volume. Again, we would not have been able to do this in Mexico
without our network and the Santander value-added as a group.
Very importantly – and there is no immediate effect, but that's going to be seen in the next few years. We are
bringing all of our customer payments globally into a single cloud-based modern payments platform, which will
deliver, in future years, many more benefits. We're executing on this plan and it will generate savings already
these two years, as well as having a much more modern, agile platform.
So again, all of this is supported by our tech investments as a group, which are – many of them you're seeing in
the numbers that we deliver at a high level. Much more on this and how we're going to continue delivering not just
great results for customers but for shareholders, we will cover that at the Investor Day.

So let me just end with saying that the strong position of our local banks and the progress we've made serving our
customers is seen in the growth in customer numbers. We now – we've grown 7 million up to 160 million
customers. That's an 8% increase. We're making strong and very clear advances in the digital space, which is
accelerating. Our digital customers already reached 51 million. Digital transactions are at 80% of the total –
exceeding both our customer and digital activity levels.
We're improving customer experience. And very importantly, we're delivering these results in the right way. We've
taken a very important step to integrate further our environmental, social governance issues into the day-to-day.
We created a green and energy transition finance team, which reports to the CEO, to the CIB and the [ph] CEO
(00:16:39) to embed consistent practices in green finance across all our business units, including how we help our
retail customers, not just our big customers transition. We see a huge opportunity here, as well as a huge
responsibility to support the transition of our customers to a green economy.
You have here the targets. We're ahead of our targets. We committed to do €120 billion of green finance. We are
at €91 billion. We remain a global leader in renewables financing, number two in the world by deals and volumes.
We're moving forward in our net zero ambition. We have three new interim targets to decarbonize our portfolios.
Importantly, we're now accelerating this in consumer. We did €5 billion mainly electric vehicles, but also bicycles
and others. And in wealth management, we're also making progress. We had achieved €53 billion of our
commitment of €100 billion AUMs in socially responsible investment.
None of this would be possible without the work we are doing with our teams and our culture. It's something,
which is maybe not evident in the numbers, but it is behind the numbers. And to me, it's at the core of our
success. And I'm very excited about what Héctor brings to the table here. No pressure. It's our ability to build a
culture of teamwork, attract and retain the best team members, and of course, work as one Santander, but very
importantly also, our work to have financial inclusion.
And again, you can see the results of these efforts both internally and externally. We have highly engaged
employees, well within the top 10 of the financial sector. We measure this. We are very proud of the progress in
gender equality. By the way, we're named again number one bank in the world and number two company globally
in terms of diversity, gender diversity last – I think two days ago by Bloomberg and really closing the gap to zero
hopefully soon on the pay gap. We have many more woman in top management roles. We set ourselves at 50%
increase for [ph] 20 to 30 (00:18:55) a couple of years ago by 30 – sorry, by 2025 to be at 30%. We're very proud
to be at 29% this year.
Financial inclusion is a hugely important goal for us. It's also good for the country, it's good for the economy, and
of course, will help us down the road. But we reached the 10 million financial inclusion – actually three years
ahead. We set it for 2025. And we've been named the World (sic) [World's] (00:19:21) Best Bank for Financial
Inclusion by Euromoney. And of course, we continue to be a benchmark in the sector with woman representing
40% of the group's board of directors. We believe strongly that diversity is not just the right thing, but leads to
better business outcomes and better decisions.
So I would like to leave it here. And then, Héctor will now go into more detail into the group's performance.

Héctor Grisi Checa
Chief Executive Officer, Santander Holdings USA, Inc.
Thank you, Ana. As you say, no pressure. So good morning to everyone. Let's go back into the income statement
for a little bit. As usual, we are showing the growth rates both in euros and cost in euros, okay? As you can see,

there was a positive impact from exchange rates from around 5 to 6 percentile points. These are partially offset by
FX hedge and the corporate center, okay? We're including gains on financial transactions here as well.
In constant euros, revenue grew at a faster pace than previous quarter, as you can see, and cost faced
inflationary pressures but continued to increase below the rate of inflation. Thanks to this performance, net
operating income exceeded €28 billion, which is, as the Chair said, a new record. In loan loss provisions, there
are different forces impacting the [ph] year-end (00:20:40) performance. There were COVID-19-related LLPs
releases in 2021, an additional LLPs in 2022 relating mainly toward the macro assumptions and some of the
normalization that we had had. I'll explain this later in much more detail.
This year also registered higher charges related to regulatory funds, new resolution schemes and lower minority
interest and tax burden. Q4 was impacted mainly by the Deposit Guarantee Fund, the Bank Levy charges of
approximately €300 million after tax and €127 million because of the AML settlement we did with the UK
authorities. All in all, it's a record year in NII, revenue, pre-provision profit and profit supported by our geographic
business diversification. As I said, diversification is resilience.
During the year in all regions, as you can see, we increased volumes specifically deposits, okay, quite strongly
and also revenue, while we reduced cost in real terms and maintained our credit quality under control.
Regarding profit and profitability, South and North America ended 2022 with outstanding profitability levels. There
was a notable recovery in profit and RoTE in Europe. DCB, with its strong presence in Europe, improved its
profitability and profit, showing the benefits of consistent execution of our strategy.
In CIB and Wealth Management, we also produced excellent performance with profit growth of 31% and 15%
respectively. In addition, revenue growth in our payments businesses like PagoNxt and cards increased at high
double digits and above the target. Our diversification and scale are key to improving results and profitability as
well as being essential for stability.
I will go now through the main P&L items in much more detail. As you can see in this chart, starting with the
quarterly trends in constant euros, a strong revenue improvement quarter-on-quarter supported mainly by all
regions and global businesses. The last quarter of this year was €1.4 billion higher than in Q4 2021, boosted
mainly by NII, €1.2 billion, exactly. Looking at Q4 versus Q3 in detail, NII maintained a consistent upward trend.
Q4 increased 6% versus Q3, mainly driven by Europe, 13%, mainly Spain, with a 25% growth. And another
strong quarter in North America after record NII in Q3. South America also rose 6% due to Argentina and Brazil
1% while Chile continued to be impacted by the negative sensitivity to interest rate rises and the lower inflation.
As you can see also, our net fee income continued to recover with positive trends, mainly South America DCB
and in the global businesses. Trading income increased last quarter, driven mainly by the Spain and the corporate
center, the FX hedge and, as you can see in the chart, as the chart has already mentioned, this is in line with a
very small portion of our total revenue. Finally, other income decreased in Q4, affected by Deposit Guarantee
Fund charges that I already explained and detailed.
Moving on to the full year, NII rose 16% in constant euros. NII rose 9% in Europe, plus 19%; North America, 7%;
and South America at 6%. If we look at the main drivers of the NII and NIM improvement, we have a broad-based
growth in loans and deposits. Loans were up on all regions, low single digits in Europe and high single digits in
North America and DCB with double digits in South America.

The global business has grown also, of note, CIB plus 11%. Likewise, deposits also increased strongly in all the
regions. Interest rate hikes mainly benefited the UK, Poland and Mexico and are not yet fully reflected as you
have seen in Spain, Portugal and the US. But Brazil, Chile and DCB are still affected by the negative sensitivity to
the interest rate rises.
The group net interest margin increased to 2.5 – 2.53% from 2.41% in the fiscal year 2021, is mainly supported by
our cost of deposit management. Given that there was no economic benefit in maintaining most of our TLTRO
positions following the changing conditions announced in October, we were able to accelerate TLTRO
repayments and have repaid €61 billion to date mainly in Banco Santander which has repaid €56 billion out of the
€61 billion in total that we had. We expect this positive NII performance to continue in 2023 as we still have room
for improvement as interest rate increases have not yet been fully passed in some of the countries. We are also
rebuilding our ALCO positions from their current low exposure, mainly in Spain and we are taking advantage of
the higher yields by doing that. The rise of interest rates would generate an increase in NII over a 12-month
period of around €2 billion to €2.5 billion considering the forward curves that we have in the interest.
On fee income, we have positive performance in all regions. Europe is up 3%, North America 6% and South
America around 11%. DCB also up by 3%. This performance was supported mainly by greater activity in high
value added products and services, as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide.
Let's move on to cost. The sharp increase in inflation led to an overall increase in cost. However, in real terms,
cost fell by 5% as we continued to improve productivity and cross-border collaboration. Our efficiency ratio is one
of the best in the sector, 45.8%. We improved this year and we were able to end 2022 close to our target despite
inflationary pressures and [indiscernible] (00:27:39) some regions between its impact on cost, almost – which is
almost automatic, mainly in Latin America and the uplift to revenue from higher interest rates, which will continue
to feed through the coming quarters.
Structural changes in our operating model are driving new productivity gains. An example of this is Europe, which
have better efficiency ratio and where we have significantly reduced cost base over the last few years. Also, we
are working on transformation, simplification and on reducing the cost to serve while maintaining service quality.
For example, in Spain, the cost to serve per customer fell around 7%.
Turning to the risk performance, LLPs grew year-on-year due to first, COVID-19-related provisions released in
2021, as I previously said; the additional €1.4 billion of macro provisions in 2022, mainly Spain, the US and the
UK, part of which [indiscernible] (00:28:44) already considered.
Brazil and Poland – and Q4 was also impacted by the normalization that we had in the US and a one-off that we
had in CIB in Brazil.
In terms of cost of risk, we're not seeing significant deterioration. We have improvements in Brazil to 0.61% and
Mexico 1.95%. Normalization continued in the UK and the US from extremely low levels in 2021 and Poland was
impacted by the mortgages. In Brazil, quarterly cost of risk peaked in the year in Q2, having declined in Q3 and
Q4, excluding the one-off. The full year also will have been in line with our previous estimate.
In summary, in an uncertain environment, we met our 2022 cost of risk target, and we have taken measures over
the last few years to improve the risk profile. Moreover, there is no significant worsening of the variables that have
the greatest impact on credit deterioration in the countries where we operate, mainly unemployment.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 02-Feb-2023
This performance was supported by a high quality of our portfolio. The NPL ratio was 3.08%, better year-on-year,
with improvements mainly in Europe and DCB. It fell 145 basis points in Spain year-on-year, in part due to the
portfolio sales we executed. Total loan loss reserves stood at around €23 billion, and portfolio distribution by
stage remained mostly stable. On the right-hand side, there is a brief overview of our loan portfolio structure. 65%
of the total portfolio, as you can see, is secured, mostly with real estate collateral. 80% of loans are mostly
concentrated in mature markets. In developing markets, Brazil accounts for just 9% of the group total exposure.
And if you see it by segment, our mortgages have low average LTVs. The consumer lending portfolio is very well
collateralized short term and has high returns. The SME and corporate portfolio is covered with around 50%
warranties. Lastly, two-thirds of the CIB portfolio is investment grade, in other words, a very high quality portfolio.
It's important to address that the loan portfolio has a medium/low risk profile and is very predictable. The main
economic variables that most affect our business are expected to remain resilient across – along all the footprint.
This, coupled with a group focus in recent years on balance sheet strength, has allowed us to improve our credit
risk profile and face the current environment with really great confidence.
Let's look at the main countries. In Spain, we have significantly reduced the average LTV of the mortgage
portfolio, is around 62%. Our corporate portfolio improved its rating and the ICO, ICO portfolio performed better
than expected. The macro environment also is better than previous – than in previous crisis and employment, as
our Chair said, is more – much more resilient. In the UK, 12% of the portfolio is floating. The simple average LTV
for mortgages is around 40% and less than 5% of the portfolio has LTVs below 80%. New business vintage
delinquency rates are stable and without any sign of deterioration. And from a macro perspective, the UK has a
very low unemployment rate. We are also very positive in Brazil and the US as we are very well positioned to face
the context of the normalization that we've been having.
Let's go in detail to Brazil, okay? We have, as you can – as you have seen, a very different economic
environment. We have demonstrated, first of all, that our risk management capabilities are strong enough to face
a very challenging scenario. Our cost of risk in Brazil has remained below 5% over the past seven years and on
average closer to 4% with greater stability than our local peers. Additionally, during these last years, and lately
starting last quarter of 2021, we have taken a cautionary actions in order to improve the structure of the portfolio.
Let me explain it in detail. We have been very more selective in origination to increase exposure, basically to
lower risk, collateralized portfolio like mortgages, agro or payrolls. As you can see in the graph on the bottom left
side, we have increased secured loans by weighting by more than 10 percentage points. We have also enhanced
the profile of our customers. The weight of the new vintages with best ratings has increased from 79% to 84%.
This has been reflected in 90-day delinquency ratio, which has improved from 4% in the old vintages to 2% in the
new ones. Finally, in the right side of the slide, you can see what the cost of risk increase in the last two year was,
mainly driven by personal and auto loans portfolio, which has recently improved very much in the trends. All in all,
given our risk management, the enhanced portfolio mix and the new lending profile, we don't expect a
deterioration of the cost of risk on a like-for-like basis in 2023 in Brazil.
Now let's go and focus on the US. With regard to credit, in 2022, performance was better than initially expected.
As you know, much of Santander US provisions come out of our auto businesses where the anticipated credit
normalization began later than we would have thought, but is now materializing.
While looking at the slide a key variable for 2023 performance will be loan loss provisions performance in auto
credit. Here we see in detail. First, the normalization of credit performance will continue through – throughout
2023 and increased cost of risk driven by two years of loan losses due to COVID stimulus and the pandemic-
related factors. Number two, the portfolio mix shift towards better quality. The percentage of the prime FICOs in

the loan portfolio has increased since 2016 from 14% to 41%. The higher mix of prime loans implies better credit
profile and decreases the cost of risk. It is important to note the significant progress made in establishing a full
spectrum auto business funded by our consumer deposits. Currently, 30% of the portfolio is retail funded versus
17% in 2019. As the risk profile normalizes in the US, European regulation is more demanding with regard to
classification by stages thereby requiring greater provisions. All combined, we expect cost of risk to increase in
2023 but remain below pre-pandemic levels of 2.85% in – that we had in – of 2.85% in 2019 as the improved
portfolio mix will support the asset quality.
Now, let's discuss capital. We are very comfortable with our capital position. We are in line with our target to be
above 12% and, once again, the numbers show the strength of our organic capital generation. During the year,
there was 138 basis points of gross organic generation, of which 62 basis points were assigned to shareholder
remuneration. This increase was partly offset by impacts from markets and models, which have embedded a
culture across organization that puts capital efficiency at the heart of all decisions and from key strategies at
board level to the day-to-day origination process. As a result, we have an enhanced portfolio management and
increased our balance sheet rotation. Levers that have been implemented are securitization, asset sales or risk
transfer through credit protection and also use of guarantees.
The group return on risk-weighted assets of 1.8% was boosted by higher margins, spend discipline and efficient
capital deployment and front book return on risk-weighted assets was 2.6%, with all regions meeting or improving
their profitability targets. RWAs with positive [indiscernible] (00:37:51) increased from 70% to 80%, with key
improvements in the company segments in Spain, the UK and the US mainly in 2022. Thank you.

Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea
Group Executive Chair, Banco Santander SA
Thank you. Thank you very much, Héctor. And let me – now allow me to sum up before we go to the Q&A and
just to briefly summarize our results for 2022 and our targets that we are setting for 2023. As I said, 2022 was a
year that again surprised us and was unexpected on many fronts. We faced many things and I want to emphasize
this, out of our control, but we did deliver with our focus on what we do control and the proven success of our
strategy and business model and focus on execution enabled us to deliver these excellent results. We continued
to grow customers and met all our targets; improve customer experience, you can see this in the growth in
revenues and profits; we continued to improve our businesses and operating model and profitability as we
invested for the future. We continued to deliver strong risk performance and capital generation. And again, all of
this is reflected in greater shareholder remuneration and value creation.
I'm not going to dwell on this, but I just want to reiterate that when we set the 2019 medium term plans, we were
not counting with COVID, we were not counting with the war in Europe and we have delivered in spite of that on
every single one of our targets and almost delivered on efficiency in spite of the high inflation. And this is really
important because we have done this at a time – at the same time as we've strengthened our business and
operating model and our cultural transformation. So again, I want to stress that we have not just delivered in the
medium term plan in 2022, we have set the foundations to allow us to grow profitably into the future and deliver
for our shareholders' increasing returns.
As we look ahead, we are confident that all of this places us in a very unique situation vis-à-vis our peers. We are
confident we can continue to increase profitability and that this will be done at the same time as we drive growth,
double-digit revenue growth again supported by both greater activity and the change in our model, more
customers and also the higher interest rate environment. We have significant tailwinds in Europe. With the current
curve, this is a significant amount, over €2 billion. Maybe Héctor wants to give some more details later. Further

improvement in our efficiency ratio, we do expect cost of risk to tick up during the year, in part driven by the
normalization of provisions in the US that Héctor covered and you can see in the slide he shared.
Again, based on current economic consensus, we are seeing the cost of risk remaining below 1.2% in 2023, but
very importantly, we are confident that revenue growth will continue to outpace growth in provisions and costs.
And of course, this is what leads us to a projection of and a guidance we're giving on return on tangible equity
above 15% already in 2023.
Last but not least, I've said it before. I am absolutely and we are absolutely convinced that it's our purpose and
how we want to be different, that it's going to enable Santander to deliver today and into the future. This has been
our guide since 2015 and it's still our guide. It's part of our culture. It defines how we do business and again, will
allow us to continue progressing together as a team. We are here to help people and businesses prosper. Our
aim is to be the best open financial services platform by acting responsibly and earning the lasting loyalty of our
people, customers, shareholders and communities. And this is what will drive future growth and customer loyalty,
increase profitability and drive greater shareholder remuneration and value creation.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you, everyone. [Operator Instructions] And we already have our first question coming from
Francisco Riquel from Alantra. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Francisco Riquel Q
Analyst, Alantra Equities Sociedad de Valores SA
Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions and congratulations for the results. Two for me. First, on
cost of risk. In Brazil, I wonder if you can comment the coverage ratio that you have now, provision for the one-off
NPL in CIB that you mention and what is the calendar of provisions left for this single name in 2023? And in this
context, if you can give guidance on the cost of risk that we should expect for Brazil with and without this one-off
just to assess the underlying trends in asset quality.
Second in cost of risk is the US business. You're guiding for a net charge-off in 2023 below pre-COVID levels.
Other listed peers in consumer finance there in the US are already above pre-COVID in 2022. So, I wonder if you
can reassure us why SCUSA will outperform in this cycle, how much are internal reasons because of the de-
risking and how much is because you are more optimistic in the macro and interest rates? And last question is on
capital. If you can please update on the regulatory headwinds left for 2023. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chair, Banco Santander SA
Okay. Let me take that first and then Héctor, you might want to complement this. So, on Brazil cost of risk, first,
we do not comment on single customer names. The provisions we've made in 2022 are, we believe, prudent and
12

follow both our internal and auditor's guidance. We believe we're covered sufficiently for now. What's important is
that we are guiding for cost of risk for the group to be below 1.2%. And excluding the one-off in 2022, we are
expecting cost of risk in Brazil to be stable.
I would let Héctor maybe or José in terms of coverage and other trends in Brazil. In the US and again, I will pass
over to Héctor also. But I just want to stress something which is really important. Since 2016, we have de-risked
our consumer business in the US. We have worked together with the group, and we have worked together with
our retail bank.
So, two very important data points is because thanks to this combination where we see our business in the US to
be very different from our retail peers, we are now at 41% of our auto business being prime, 41%. It was 14% in
2016. That's one of the big reasons why, yes, we expect normalization, but not to the previous levels.
By the way, 30% of our business in the US is now retail funded because we do have retail deposits and
leveraging on OEM relationships. We won Mitsubishi and others – actually Mitsubishi only in the US recently. So
this is really important. And [ph] not an (00:45:33) important point, as in Héctor's slide, you can see this, is we sold
the riskier portfolio we had in SCUSA, which was Bluestem. We've done many more things to simplify the
business the last few years, but these are the two bigger points. Again, I don't know if Héctor would like to add
something.
On capital, our guidance is very clear. We expect to continue to build capital. I believe Héctor mentioned, we do
not have any significant regulatory headwinds in 2023, but please comment on that again. I think on capital what's
important is, we have been building capital for the last seven years. We raised the big amount of capital when I
arrived in 2015. We reached the level of capital of 12% last year. We said we'll be above 12% every quarter. We
are now in line with peers and what's important, we've shown again this year it's less volatile than other peers. So
Héctor or José, would you like to add on – Héctor, on cost of risk in Brazil? Anything else on coverage on the US?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer, Santander Holdings USA, Inc.
Cost of risk, I mean, in Brazil – in terms of Brazil, Ana, as you have said, I mean, it's quite clear, we have changed
a little bit the mix. What we're doing, we took the decisions where we needed to take them and I see it very stable.
And that's exactly the guidance we're giving [indiscernible] (00:46:49). And in terms of the coverage, as we – as I
have said, we have €1.4 billion of overlays that we did both in the US and Brazil to cover those. So I will feel very
comfortable with what we have done and with the amount of reserves and provisions that we have in both of
them.
In terms of the US, you have explained it perfectly well. The change of mix basically changes the outlook of what
we used to have before. So, we don't believe that the cost of risk is going to go back to 2019 levels. And actually
what we have seen is that trend is a little bit positive than we expected at the beginning. And in terms of the
capital, I don't know, José, do you like to comment, but what I have seen is...

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Exactly. We don't expect any significant supervisory charges in 2023. The charges in 2022 were very much in line
with our expected 25 basis points or so for the year as a whole. In this quarter is where we had a impact of the
new models, mortgages Spain and SME Spain. And again, most models or all significant models have already

been updated. So we don't expect any significant charges going forward. And in terms of coverage, provisions,
etcetera, €1.4 billion macro provisions we made in 2022 for the group as a whole, we believe are sufficiently
prudent to support the guidance of a cost of risk of below 1.2% for next year.

Thank you, all. Can we have the next question, please?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: The next question is coming from Ignacio Cerezo from UBS.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Cerezo Q
Analyst, UBS AG (London Branch)
Yeah. Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is on the US. If you can give us a little
bit of color on the difference in terms of loan yield and the cost of risk of the different FICO buckets to get some
flavor basically on how relevant that is – that you have increased significantly the weight of FICO above 640
versus below 600. So, if you can give some numbers basically, again, to get a better reference on that.
And the second one is, if you can clarify the tax rate you're using for your guidance in 2022 on a group basis? And
the third one is if you can update us on the Basel IV impact you're expecting. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chair, Banco Santander SA
Ignacio, I mean, the FICO yields on the portfolio, as we say in Spanish [Foreign Language] (00:49:23), and
maybe Héctor can answer that. But what I can tell you is that what really is important is that we have sold
Bluestem that was source of significant risk, which we sold, I have to say, exactly at the right time. Second, that,
independently of the margins, which come up and down depending on competition, clearly, 41% in prime or
above, is a very different risk profile. And, to be honest, I mean, I don't know, Héctor, if you can add a bit more
color on that in a few minutes. In terms of the taxes, in – our effective tax rate was 33% in 2021. We have still – I
think in 2022, we'll be somewhere around 29%; and in 2023, nominal taxes – right, nominal taxes were expected
to change. Yes, you will have this tax on revenues from Spain, which we estimate and we were instructed by our
accountants and market authorities to put it in 2023 and, I think, that's €225 million, but that's not going to be seen
at the tax level, it's going to be seen on the revenues. But, yes, we are not expecting any change in nominal tax
rates.
And the last one was on?

Final implementation of Basel III. We – as you all know, we still don't have the final proposal – regulatory
proposal. We have had some positive news for us, like the multiplying factor ILM equal to 1, which was finally
included. As you all know also we are not affected by the output floor. We are going to be affected by some other
items like the operational risk, but until the final legislation is written and approved, it's difficult to give an accurate
estimate. But what I can tell is that it's not going to be significant and we should be able to build plenty of capital in
the next two years to compensate for any impact that we may have.
Ignacio – sorry, Ignacio. Just very quickly in your first question, okay. I don't have the exact detail on the FICO
what you're saying. But if you go to the page on the US on the presentation of the left-hand bottom side, you can
see there exactly what's the mix that we have, no? So, you have the reds that are basically 41% in the portfolio.
This is prime, a near prime, which is basically what we had done in changing the mix that we have. And we
couldn't have done that unless we had the funding from SBNA that is basically now funding a big percentage on –
of the portfolio. So, this portfolio is mainly funded for that. And I'll – I can give you later the details on that. But
that's basically the change of the mix that we have at this point. So, the risk is a lot less than we had before. You
can see how it has been growing and changes completely and 30% is funded with our own deposit, okay? So, it's
quite important to understand that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Begoña Morenés A
Global Head-Shareholder & Investor Relations, Banco Santander SA
Thank you, Ignacio. We will get back to you from IR with the yields on the FICO. Don't worry. Can I have the next
question, please?

Operator: The next question is coming from Ignacio Ulargui, BNP Paribas Exane.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Ulargui Q
Analyst, Exane BNP Paribas
Thanks. Thanks very much for taking my questions. I have two questions. One, a bit more focused on costs. If
you looked at the – if we looked at the performance of the bank in developed economies, it has definitely been
able to control inflation quite well. It has not been that – the case probably in LatAm. Just wanted to see if there is
any kind of additional initiatives that you can push forward to control a bit more cost growth in the region.
And the second question it's linked to the deposit franchises. Given your global footprint and the different
experience that you have had in different interest rate cycles, how do you see banks performing or behaving in
terms of deposit betas? I mean, should we expect a material acceleration of deposit betas in Europe or based on
your LatAm experience, do you think that that should be more controlled? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chair, Banco Santander SA
So, let me just give a high level question and then maybe, Héctor, you can help me here. So, in terms of cost
control in LatAm, let me just say that within the cost of risk – sorry, cost guidance we're giving, 44% to 45%, we
expect to be – in the US, we're making structural changes. We started this a year ago. As you know, we're not
able to change the model until 12 months ago because of minorities and other issues. So, we believe that cost will
be flat or down in the US. Again, please confirm this for me.
In South America, there will be stable – we're focused on cost control. Given the lingering effects of inflation, we
believe that that will be more or less flat. You will see some increase in Mexico. Again, in Europe, we expect to
have costs. But again, we're giving cost to income guidance because of inflation and uncertainties there. So,

there's some space. But as you saw, Spain, for example, costs came down around 5%. If I remember correctly, it
was 5% for the whole group. In the UK, we had good cost control. We expect that to continue going forward. So it
depends very much on the countries. And in LatAm, South America, I believe, is sort of flattish. US is flat to down
and Mexico will be up but, Héctor, you can help me here.
Deposit franchises, I mean, this is important and we have grown deposits in many of our core markets including in
the US. This is really important. We do believe increased competition but again, here, what's important is the net
interest margin. We expect that to expand not just because of the fact that we're not paying a lot of our deposit
franchises. Remember, we're retail. We're not paying retail franchises when rates were negative. At some point,
yes, we will start paying for deposits, but we're in a strong competitive in-market position and we believe the
structural changes in the model with better service and better digital capacity will help us to do better there. So I
don't know if you want to add anything there on the cost control in LatAm, Mexico, US or other countries, Héctor?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer, Santander Holdings USA, Inc.
Yes, just in cost control, I mean, as you can see, I mean, Latin America is much more difficult given that people
are used to it and a lot of it is indexed of what we do. But we have been able to maintain it below inflation in most
of the countries. The important fact here and the important change of what we used to do is that we're working
together much more and we are developing a lot of our software together and decreasing the amount of risk that
we are – sorry, the amount of expenses that we are generating in all of the countries. As our Chair has explained,
for example, I mean, the acquiring platform was developed by Getnet and is being used in the rest of the
countries. Also, the important fact is that the way we are handling the different – the different expenses is very
much controlled and we have put – implemented one of the main drivers, that is, basically all of what we do in
infrastructure, and we're maintaining it to the minimum. So, in that regard, we believe that we're going to be able
to control costs below inflation, which is, I believe, the most important point and to maintain, as we have said,
under the guidance that we have given.
In terms of the deposit franchise, I can give you some of the beta deposits that we have. In Spain is around 25%
to 30%, the UK is around 30%, the US around 40% and Brazil is around 80%. It's very automatic. But what also
we can tell you is that, in the last quarter, we have been able to also increase deposits in some of our most
important markets. Take a look, for example, deposit growth in the US was 20%. Mexico, in the last quarter,
outpaced our competitors in that sense and we have been – we're going to be very much focused on that in the
whole franchise and in the different parts of the bank to really enhance our deposit gathering business.

Alvaro Serrano Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. International Plc
And good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Apologize. I've got a follow-up on US and one on or a new
one on Brazil. On the US, I'm looking at your charts on the right-hand side on slide 25 that you showed the
delinquencies or early delinquencies. My understanding is that the vintages of the second half 2021 and, in
particular, the vintages of 2022, were the ones that deteriorated most [indiscernible] (00:58:43) from competitors,
but it looks like you're showing an improvement. So maybe you can comment on apart from the general

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 02-Feb-2023
comments you've made, specifically on the latest vintages, is that what's giving you confidence or maybe some
commentary there? And within that guidance of the cost of risk in the US, maybe you can share what the comp
price assumption you're using for this year? I know your competitors are expecting mid-teens reductions, right, but
I don't know what you're factoring in that cost of risk?
And on Brazil, just some commentary maybe on the NII growth that we can look forward to this year. It's obviously
been slow as you had already guided to in the second half of 2022. I don't know if with the latest sort of rate
expectations should we expect only growth in the second half, as you were saying before or any updates on the
Brazilian sort of dynamics? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chair, Banco Santander SA
So, yeah – so, thanks. I will – I'll actually just give another high level apologies for that. I think it's important to put
vintages and more specific questions in the US in the context of the country. I think it's really important to
understand that our US business is fundamentally much stronger than it was three or four years ago, including the
consumer business. It's a business, we understand. We know how to manage. We're in control. The cost of risk
this year was better than guided. The lease – leases is what linked to car prices maybe that's lease sales that
maybe Héctor can address that. But what is important is we're very confident that we can deliver 15% through-
the-cycle returns in the US.
I also want to point out that in the last three – four years, actually 2019 to 2022 medium term plan, the US was the
country that added most value to the group in euros. Actually the combination and this is after all cost to TNAV
effects in euros for shareholders, US and Brazil, were the top two, delivering 50% of the total shareholder value
creation. This is really important as you think about where we put our capital. It has proven to be anti-cyclical
because of the two extraordinary years we had in the US, almost [ph] €5 billion (01:01:03) in dividends last year
and more coming this year, and we've looked at this business inside and out. It delivers very good returns to
shareholders, way over the cost of equity through the cycle. So, again, it's important to put this in the context that
it's a business we know, it's a business we understand, it's a business that is leveraging the group, that is
leveraging the retail funding which we're using to de-risk and compete successfully with US banks in prime and
near prime. We won Mitsubishi as I mentioned and, hopefully, more to come. Having said that, Héctor, could you
address the latest vintages, please, and the car prices in a minute?
Brazil, again, as I said, US and Brazil, the two countries that have generated 50% of the value creation in euros –
after everything is assigned, 50% of the value creation in euros to shareholders in the 2019 to 2022 year plan.
Brazil has a negative exposure, I mean, negative sensitivity to rising rates. I believe this should reverse once
rates stop going up in the second half of the year. But, again, Héctor, maybe you want to add on the car prices,
Manheim Index and others?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer, Santander Holdings USA, Inc.
Sure. Look, I don't know with that specificity exactly what's going on in the vintages, but what I can tell you is what
we have seen and the trend is that the new vintages are performing much better than expected. And why is that,
because, first of all, we changed, as we have said, a little bit the mix, but also the risk profile in the sense that we
– since we were very much focused in profitability, in that regard, the risk that we are seeing in those vintages is a
little better because profitability was of the essence in what we did, and we were very much focused on that. And
in profitability based on the model that we have is based on risk. So, in that sense, what tells you is that we were
very much focused on that. And also as I told you before, the trend is much better than we have seen. And we
could see that it's going to perform better than it did in the past.

In the second one, we should see growth in Brazil in the 24% to 23% for NII. So, in that sense, we'll see that this
going quite well. We are being very cautious in Brazil in the way we manage risk. And in that sense, as the
Chairman already said, I mean, we have negative sensitivity [indiscernible] (01:03:43) rates, but the growth of the
portfolio basically offsets that. So, as you have seen, I mean, we're going to continue expanding the NII in that
sense.

Operator: The next question is coming from Marta Sanchez Romero from Citi.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Marta Sanchez Romero Q
Analyst, Citi
Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my questions. The first one is regarding your real estate exposure
in Spain. Would you say a restructuring is due and would it make sense to use some of your extra NII to clean
up?
The second question is about the US top line. It has been somewhat weak. Moving backwards – your customer
spread is moving backwards. We're seeing competition for deposits in the US. So, can you give us some color on
what to expect for NII and fee growth in the US for 2023?
And then last quick question. What's the tax rate you expect in Brazil for next year? It's been quite low this year at
just 30%. Yeah. Thank you.

So, in terms of real estate in Spain, I'm going to need a bit of help here from Héctor and José. But we are not
expecting – so our main exposure in Spain today is nothing to do with what we had back in 2008. So the
developer's exposure is at very low levels. Remember that Spain has not built many homes for the last 12, 14
years. So one of the most resilient housing markets in Europe or definitely in our 10 core markets, we expect it to
be Spain. There's been a big deleveraging of families. Employment remains very high and at the end, our real
estate exposure is mostly in the individuals in mortgages and that is we expect it to be resilient. And again, as in
the UK, very much based on employment levels which will fall but from historic highs. So in terms of restructurings
in real estate, there's nothing that is anything material that would affect our guidance or our performance in
Spain?
If you go back, for example, where were the earnings, not just Santander, but as a sector in 2008, a big chunk of
this was in real estate developers. Today, that is, I'd say, minimal, very small. And we have restructured these.
These are listed companies. That is a mark to market and it's actually doing pretty well. So there is nothing there
that would cause any concern in terms of the numbers, again, in Spain.
In terms of the US top line, I think Héctor has explained that but can give you more details. Go ahead.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 02-Feb-2023
There is one important point Marta that I think is important and I didn't say. I'm sorry about that. The important and
the top line what you're saying, you're right and the main problem is the leasing, okay? What's been happening in
the market, we used to get a lot of the cars back and we used to made a lot of money on the leases, because the
car prices and the Manheim were up and we were making a lot of money and what happened is two situations.
First of all, people saw the car prices – used car prices went up, so some of the people didn't exercise the lease
option and basically eliminated a huge amount of the profit that we were making on that.
On the secondhand, [indiscernible] (01:07:04) there were no new cars, so people basically exercised the lease
option due to the fact that there were no new cars to get a new one. So those two things hit us hard last year in
terms of the top line because leasing is a great profit center in the US. So those are the two particular things that
hit us. And that's why you look at the top line in a different way. It's not loan loss provisions, it's mainly the lack of
revenue because of the leases. Okay. So it's quite important to understand that.
And just to give you a piece of detail, in Spain, [indiscernible] (01:07:37) I mean, we don't have a huge amount of
exposure in developments or anything like that. It's mainly €60 billion to €70 billion in – around there in terms of
commercial – in mortgages, okay. That is individual mortgages. And what is important to say is that 75% of those
mortgages are in floating rate and 25% only on fixed rate. Okay? So the portfolio will start resetting mainly in April
through the end of the year.

Carlos Cobo Catena Q
Analyst, Société Générale SA (Spain)
Hi. Thank you for the presentation. And good morning. Carlos from SocGén. One is on the ALCO book in Spain. If
you could quantify how much of the increase in NII this quarter coming from the top-up in the ALCO portfolio? And
what would be the existing size on the total target?
Also, if you have similar plans for the other Continental Europe balance sheet to grow the ALCO, I think that's it. I
mean, the other questions have been answered already. If you could specify – it's not a big issue, but the double-
digit growth in revenues, the target for 2023, would that be in constant euros as well as as 2022, or that would be
a nominal? Thank you.

Sorry, let me – just one second, yeah, I let you José and Héctor. But I just want to say on the ALCOs that the
effect in Q4 is minimal from the euro. ALCO, I think we explained in the past we had a very small position. We
have rebuilt some of that – and I'll let Héctor and José address that. But there's another issue about the other
ALCOs is that we have a much higher proportion than other peers in terms of the held-to-collect.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 02-Feb-2023
Much smaller – sorry, much smaller, which means that this has hit our capital and our TNAV this quarter, but this
should come back in the fall. I have been more conservative in how we account for that. In terms of the euro
ALCO, it's still very small relative to a, say, neutral hedge position. So there is space to continue building that.
But maybe you want to address that Héctor or José.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer, Santander Holdings USA, Inc.
Yeah. Very quickly, at the end of the year, we had €11 billion more or less in euro ALCO. We've been building
that in the fourth quarter. So as the Chair said, the impact of that in the NII in the quarter was really not significant.
Our plans is to gradually build an ALCO reaching a neutral position.
Not this year, maybe in two or three years. We know that we have very, very low ALCO portfolio and we want to
gradually And so, as the Chair said, the impact of that in the NII in the quarter was really not significant. Our plans
is to gradually build an ALCO and reaching a neutral position, not this year, maybe in two or three years.
We know that we have a very, very low ALCO portfolio. And we want to gradually increase the size of the ALCO
portfolio. We will do it not only buying Spanish government bonds. We want to have a diversified portfolio –
German, Italian, French bonds as part of that portfolio going forward. This is a significant difference relative to the
way that we build our ALCO portfolios in the past.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chair, Banco Santander SA
Yes, in terms of the double-digit revenue growth, that is in current, in euros. So we are guiding to double-digit
revenue growth in euros. I think that was the other question that you asked. Yes.
Let me just say – just to expand on that, I mean, one of the reasons that our TNAV hasn't grown as much as, we
believe, it will grow in the future is that for the reason I said before. So if you look at 2019-2022 period, 50% of the
value creation was from Brazil and the US. And I'm talking in euros after all the effects. Reason for that is, of
course, that the US and Brazil did really well, but also that Europe did not do as well. And you are beginning to
see that change in 2022.
I was just checking numbers – and please take this with a grain of salt, I know Begoña will say and others – but if
you look at 2008, Santander made about €800 million in Bannister and somewhere around €2 billion – it was a
different criteria, but just for orders of magnitude – €2 billion, close to €2 billion in the Santander network.
In 2022, Spain is back to €1.5 billion. I know conditions are very different and everything – and of course, that –
how we delivered those profits, a big chunk of that was with real estate developers. Today, that is minimal, to the
previous question. So there is a big opportunity to continue improving, not just in Spain, as I said, but also in
Europe. And that's why we're guiding to double-digit revenue growth. And again, as you've seen this year, the big
delta will continue to be in Europe for different reasons, operating performance, as well as the tailwinds and
interest rates.

Operator: The next question is coming from [ph] Benjamin Thomas (01:13:12) from RBC Capital Markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Q
Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Firstly, on loan growth in the UK, it feels like the mortgage
market is about to go through a very sharp downturn. Can you give us some guidance on loan growth that you
expect in the UK for 2023?
And then, secondly, on Swiss franc mortgage component, can you just update us on the assumptions you're
listing for the provision there, please, and how those assumptions compare to peers? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chair, Banco Santander SA
So I will let Héctor with the Swiss franc. But just on the UK, it's a market that I'm very familiar with. We're
expecting to improve profitability in 2023. We are focusing more on margins than volumes because there is a very
competitive and challenging environment. Our cost of risk is minimal right now. We come out, I believe, if not – I
think the best on stress test until – we have a lot of focus on quality of the portfolio with a 40% loan-to-value.
And it is important, as I said before, the macro context unemployment. And this is the key one for us in terms of
how we will perform, not just net interest income and revenues, but also overall profitability, including in the UK.
So I don't know if – by the way, the UK is the only country where, as you know, both the IMF, but also in our
numbers, we are expecting a recession – a negative growth for the whole of 2023, okay?
But, again, unemployment even if it – so, GDP contracting, I think our numbers are 1.3%, but from very low levels.
So we are monitoring very carefully our portfolio. Again, the return on mortgages is still very attractive, above the
cost of equity. And I don't know if you want to complement that, Héctor, and address, please, if you can the Swiss
franc mortgage question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer, Santander Holdings USA, Inc.
Swiss francs, we increased the coverage of the Swiss franc portfolio to over 40% at the end of last year of around
45%, which is very much in line with the figures that we have for our competitors at the end of the third quarter.
Probably – we are basing that on our experience of the recent court rulings locally.
So it's important to stress that we are already above the KNF recommended level in Poland. So we feel
comfortable with that level. And, again, we will be assigning provisions to this portfolio in the future based on the
experience of court rulings.
We are, as you know, still expecting a very important ruling from the European Court of Justice, particularly
related to the capital returns. So again, this is a very fluid situation. Future provisions, again, will be assigned
depending on court rulings locally.

Operator: We have a question coming from Andrea Filtri from Mediobanca.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrea Filtri Q
Analyst, Mediobanca SpA (United Kingdom)
Yes. Thank you. Could you please provide more geographical visibility for the main countries behind the double-
digit revenue growth for 2023? And we got that this target is in euros, the question before was if it's constant
euros or if it is adjusted for the future FX.
The second question is on your €2 billion to €2.5 billion rate sensitivity, can you please elaborate the assumptions
behind that? i.e., which forward curve are you using and what date? And what are the possibilities are you
assuming in each country for your guidance? And just finally, if you could give us the detail of the structural hedge
on the UK portfolio. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chair, Banco Santander SA
Yes. Please, let me just correct something in terms of revenues. I said current euro – it's in constant, the double-
digit revenue growth. In terms of the – but it is the same, right? We also – yeah, we're guiding actually both should
increase; both constant and also current. The €2 billion to €2.5 billion rate sensitivity, that's based on the current
forward curves. I mean, I think that was the day we did the presentation, but my team can and the IR can give you
more detail on that one.
In terms of deposit betas, actually Héctor went through that in another question. Maybe you want to repeat it, the
deposit betas. I'll leave you go through that again. But he answered that. And in terms of geographic visibility and
guidance, we'll give detail on that in Investor Day. But I do want to stress one thing. This is not just about
geographies, this is also about the global businesses and the Santander network, which has been one of the key
advances we've made in the last few years. And there's a lot more opportunity to leverage these global
businesses.
As we're already doing and showing with CIB, Wealth Management, and payments and auto to a lesser extent.
So we will give you more visibility how this benefits the individual geographies in the coming Investor Day.
I think I answered [ph] both (01:18:55) questions and maybe you want to repeat the deposit betas, and then
maybe José.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Héctor Grisi Checa A
Chief Executive Officer, Santander Holdings USA, Inc.
Yeah. The betas, as I said, are 25% to 30% in Spain. In UK, around 30%; in the US, around 40%; and Brazil,
around 80%. And as you know, very automatic due to the fact that it's indexed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. So the way we've done the interest rate sensitivity is on the static balance sheet at the end of December,
running the forward rates on the 31st of December for each currency with the betas that Héctor just mentioned.
So no assumption on volume growth or repricing. So when you look at our double-digit revenue growth, double-
digit revenue growth for next year means roughly €5 billion increase in revenues. And what we are saying is that
between €2 billion to €2.5 billion of that will come just from interest rate sensitivity, most of which is in euros,

obviously. So the structural hedge in the UK, which was the final question, it's pretty stable at around £100 billion,
it's £100 billion, more or less. Structural hedge in the UK.

Operator: The next question is coming from Daragh Quinn from KBW.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Daragh Quinn Q
Analyst, KBW
Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Just a follow-up question on Brazil and the outlook for the cost of risk in
2023. And I think you said that you expect it to be stable. Is that relative to the actual number reported in 2022,
the 4.8% or the underlying one at 4.6%, which excludes the one-off that we saw in Q4?
And then, a second question on Spain and the outlook for NII, maybe just if you can give us some sense of what
kind of magnitude of NII growth you're expecting for next year, and to what extent do you think that NII growth –
maybe not just for you but for the industry as a whole in Spain will generate more political risk in this year of
elections?
And then, finally, sorry, just a quick question on the European consumer finance or the Digital Consumer Bank,
it's probably one of the unique businesses in the group, which relies more on wholesale funding or group funding.
Maybe just if you could give a comment on your outlook for how that funding will reprice in 2023 and the impact
you see on margin for that business now over the next 12 months? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ana Patricia Botín-Sanz de Sautuola O'Shea A
Group Executive Chair, Banco Santander SA
Okay. So the first one is easy. It's excluding the one-off. So excluding the one-off, so around 4.6% is the number
that we published. That's the stability, so roughly stable. We're not saying a number. I'm saying roughly stable,
excluding the one-off. Investor Day, probably, we'll give a more detailed guidance or not – we have to decide
exactly how much we give.
I just want to go back to the group, because, again, what Santander offers is a group. It's not just a specific
country. And I think what matters is that we delivered less than 1% cost of risk in spite of one-off, in spite of
inflation, in spite of things being very different.
Please – this is exactly the work we have been doing and we are increasing and Héctor is fully focused on how
can we combine this unique global scale with in-market scale, so that Santander as a whole, makes more money,
is more profitable, and creates more value. So – but again, 4.6% is the roughly stability.
Net interest income in Spain. Again, details will be given in Investor Day. But I do want to reiterate what I said
before. We're still below the levels – way below the levels. Again, very different market, but a much better quality
of earnings today than what we had before. Spain is growing the number of customers. Spain is gaining market
share in deposits. I think Héctor mentioned that. I think around 15% last year. Spain has grown [ph] 700,000
(01:23:26) new customers last year.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 02-Feb-2023
So what you're seeing in Spain is a combination of very important – a change in the model already. And we will
tell you more about where that is going in the next few years and also the tailwind in interest rates. And as the
CFO explained, a very conservative ALCO in euros, which, of course, mainly benefits Spain.
DCB, that one I know well. So DCB is obviously like our consumer business in the US, these are businesses that
are more hard hit by higher rates. In spite of that, we've actually improved our return on tangible equity to 14%.
We, as you know, joined up DCB with Openbank. So we have now a digital bank helping to fund our business in
DCB with very good growth in deposits, and by the way, very cheap deposits.
So if I remember correctly the €10 billion, €11 billion of Openbank is at around 5 basis points costs, so that is
helping. In terms of cost of risk and I can say that. So if you look at – so we're seeing a normalization of cost of
risk with all the caveats and less risky portfolio and so on that Héctor explained in the US. We're seeing a
normalization again in the UK from very, very low levels. And we will some normalization in DCB. And all of that is
included within the less than 1.2% cost of risk. You know, more details to come I think any...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Yeah, just a couple of things. On NII Spain, the – as I said, the €2 billion to €2.5 billion is mostly in euros, and to a
great extent, in Spain. And quarter-on-quarter, fourth quarter over third quarter NII in Spain was up 25%. So I
think you can have a pretty good idea what NII is expected to do in next year in Spain.
Funding in DCB. DCB has around a third of its balance sheet funded with deposits. As interest rates go up, that
offers a great opportunity to improve the funding structure of DCB. And we have plans to grow deposits at DCB in
Germany and in some other countries, but mostly, in Germany over the next couple of years by a significant
amount. So this should help keep our spreads in DCB at very attractive levels.

Begoña Morenés A
Global Head-Shareholder & Investor Relations, Banco Santander SA
Thank you. We have around 10 minutes remaining on the call, so let's try and make this brief. Next question
comes from Sofie Peterzens.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Sofie Peterzens Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities Plc
Yeah. Hi. Sofie from JPMorgan. Sorry to go back to the Brazil asset quality. But If I look at your NPL ratio in
Brazil, it's now over 7.5%. But also coverage in Brazil has weakened quite significantly in the past year [ph] with
high (01:26:37) over 100%. Now, it's below 80%.
I'm just wondering, yes – and then in addition, you have 20% unsecured. Why do you feel comfortable with 80%
coverage in Brazil? Shouldn't it be closer to 100%? And also, considering that you have 20% unsecured lending
in Brazil, is it fair – and most of these loans deemed to have been originated when rates were in the low-single-
digit range. Isn't it fair to assume that NPLs probably will continue to trend up in Brazil, and if not, why not?
And then, my second question would be on the hedging policy, could you just remind us how much of your FX is
hedged and how much is it costing Santander per year to hedge the P&L and the capital? Thank you.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 02-Feb-2023
So we're very comfortable with our provisions in Brazil. Let me remind you that provisions are now forward-
looking. We've made a macro overlay 1.4% for the whole group that a lot of our portfolio in Brazil is secure and it's
actually really resilient. We've seen the deterioration already and 80% is more than enough.
Again, we follow IFRS, which are now very much forward-looking provisions. So the provisions doesn't mean that
that is the cost of risk. Provisions is the expected cost of risk. We had a big discussion if we should not change
the cost of the risk to expected cost of risk because of the way the accounting now is very forward-looking. So
we're very comfortable with our provisions in Brazil for the existing risk.
Let me also say that our cost of risk in Brazil has been 4% and 5% over the last seven years. That includes three
years with almost 10% decrease in GDP. Today, Brazil, we're expecting growth in the GDP next year,
employment to be very resilient. So we're actually quite confident that both Brazil and Mexico will grow more.
You've seen that in the recent IMF – unemployment levels in both countries have been very resilient. Again, that's
one of the main factors, yeah, in the final [ph] loss (01:28:49) of the cost of risk.
In FX, we cover, José or Héctor?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
José Antonio García Cantera A
Senior Executive Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer & Head-Finance Division, Banco Santander SA
Yeah. As you know, we have basically the following strategy. So we hedge the capital ratio. The 12% of using
group risk weighted asset CRR calculation. So what is – at 12%, we don't hedge. The hedge is done at forward
rates. So for TNAV impact, which is what I guess you're asking the question, Sofie, is indifferent how much we
hedge because for TNAV impact to predict and TNAV impact, you just take the equity invested in non-euro
countries and apply forward rates on a yearly basis and, by doing that, you can estimate the impact on TNAV
because, again, we hedge the excess over 12% at forward rates. And obviously, we have tactically hedges for our
P&L, but those flow through P&L. So when we hedge expected profits, those hedges come through the P&L.
