Phillip D. Green
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thank you, A.B. Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll review third quarter results for
Cullen/Frost and our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas will also provide additional comments before we open it
up to your questions. In the third quarter, Cullen/Frost earned $95.1 million or $1.50 per share compared with
earnings of $109.8 million or $1.73 per share reported in the same quarter last year and $93.1 million or $1.47 per
share in the second quarter of this year.
Overall, average loans in the third quarter were $18.1 billion up by 25% from $14.5 billion in the third quarter of
last year which included the impact from PPP loans. However, even excluding this impact, loans managed a 3.3%
increase from a year earlier. Average deposits in the third quarter were $32.9 billion, also up by 25% from the
$26.4 billion in the third quarter of last year and the highest quarterly average deposits in our history. We
understand that the banking industry has seen broad increases in deposit levels as authorities implemented
comprehensive fiscal and monetary responses to the pandemic; however, it's also been our experience that Frost
has historically been a safe place in times of uncertainty. And I believe this will always be a part of our growth in
challenging times. For the first time our total assets have surpassed $40 billion, up 41% in the last 5 years and all
of that representing organic growth. And speaking of organic growth, I'll discuss our Houston expansion in more
detail later in the call. But I'd like to point out that we were pleased to see our deposit market share in Houston
has now moved up to number 6 up from 10th place a year ago.
Even with the challenging environment we and others in our industry have seen pressure on profitability. Our
return on assets in the third quarter was just below 1% at 0.96%. And we were pleased to announce yesterday
the action of our board to increase our dividend for the 26th consecutive year. We saw a reduction in credit cost
expense to $20.3 million in the third quarter down from $32 million in the second quarter of 2020 this compared
with $8 million in the third quarter of last year. Net charge-offs for the third quarter were $10.2 million down
sharply from the $41 million in the second quarter and included no energy charge-offs.
Annualized net charge-offs for the third quarter were 22 basis points of average loans. Non-performing assets
were $96.4 million at the end of the third quarter compared to $85.2 million at the end of the second quarter and
$105 million at the end of the third quarter last year. The third quarter increase resulted primarily from the addition
of an energy service company. Overall delinquencies for accruing loans at the end of the third quarter were $133
million or 73 basis points of period end loans. Those numbers remain within our standards and comparable to
what we've experienced in the past several years.
Regarding payment deferrals, in total, we granted 90-day deferrals to more than 2,500 borrowers for loans
totaling $2.2 billion. At the end of the third quarter there were around 300 loans totaling $157 million in deferment
or about 1%. Total problem loans which we define as [ph] risk rate 10 and higher (00:05:30) were $803 million at
the end of the third quarter compared to $674 million at the end of the second quarter. Energy-related problem
loans were $203.5 million at the end of the third quarter compared to $176.8 million for the previous quarter and
$87.2 million for the third quarter last year. To put that in perspective, the year-end 2016 total problem energy
loans totaled nearly $600 million. Energy loans continued to decline as a percentage of our portfolio falling to
9.1% of our non-PPP portfolio at the end of the third quarter. As a reminder, the peak was 16% back in 2015. Oil
prices have stabilized from the volatile levels that we saw earlier in the year, and we continued to moderate our
company's exposure to the energy segment. Through the first nine months of this year, the pandemic's economic
impacts on our portfolio have been negative but manageable.
During our last two conference calls, we discussed the non-energy portfolio segments that have had an increased
impact from the economic dislocations brought on by the pandemic, namely, restaurants, hotels, entertainment

and sports and retail. The total of these portfolio segments excluding PPP loans represented $1.54 billion at the
end of the third quarter. And our loan loss reserve for these segments was 3.37%. New relationships are up by
38% compared with this time last year largely because of our strong efforts and reputation for success in helping
small businesses get PPP loans. The dollar amount of new loan commitments booked through September is up
by about 2% compared to the prior year.
Regarding new loan commitments booked, the balance between these relationships has stayed steady at 53%
large and 47% core so far in 2020. The market remains competitive, and in fact seems to be getting more or so.
For instance, the percentage of deals lost to structure increased from 61% this time last year to 70% this year. It's
good to see that in this environment, our weighted current active loan pipeline in the third quarter was up 11%,
compared with the second quarter of this year.
Consumer banking continues to see growth, although it slowed somewhat by the effects of the pandemic. Overall,
net new customer growth for the third quarter was down 13% compared with the third quarter of 2019 for
consumers. Same-store sales, as measured by account openings were down by 15.5% through the end of the
third quarter, when compared with the third quarter of 2019.
In the third quarter, 52% of our account openings came from our online channel, which includes our Frost Bank
mobile app, and online account openings were 73% higher compared to the third quarter of 2019. Our
investments in enhancing our mobile and online experience proved timely during the quarantine. The consumer
loan portfolio was $1.8 billion at the end of the third quarter, up by 6.7% compared to the third quarter of last year.
Our growth is being driven primarily by consumer real estate loans.
Our Houston expansion continues on pace with five new financial centers opened in the third quarter for a total of
20 of the 25 planned new financial centers. We expect to open two more in this quarter with the remaining three
opening in early 2021. The fact that we've been able to continue our expansion plans through the pandemic and
see very promising results is due to the dedication and skill of Frost Bankers.
And they've done a miraculous what merely seems extraordinary tends to be taken for granted, but I want to
acknowledge the commitment to the Frost philosophy and culture that our people have maintained during what
has been a very unusual year. Of course, we realize the pressures impacting the banking industry in light of the
current and projected economic and interest rate environment and the importance of operating as efficiently as
possible while providing the level of world-class customer service Frost is known for.
I'm proud of our efforts over time and in particular what we've accomplished this year, which Jerry Salinas has
been reporting on as we move through 2020. Next year will be no different. And we're committed to improving our
operating efficiency further.
In that regard, I'll note that our executive team is committed to reduce our own salaries by 10% effective January
1 as well as reducing my team's bonus targets by 5% and mine by 10% for the coming year. We're taking these
actions despite the recognized success Frost has had managing through the pandemic and supporting our
customers and communities. They represent management's desire to contribute to the current and future long-
term well-being of the company and reflect our commitment to our unique culture. All of us at Frost and all our
lines of business will face these challenges together and our company as always will emerge stronger than ever.
Now, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jerry Salinas for some additional comments.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2020
Jerry Salinas
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Thank you, Phil. Looking first at our net interest margin, our net interest margin percentage for the third quarter
with 2.95%, down 18 basis points from the 3.13% reported last quarter. The decrease primarily resulted from
lower yields on loans, which had a negative impact of approximately 11 basis points on the net interest margin
and a lower yield on securities, which had a 3 basis point negative impact, combined with an increase in the
proportion of balances of the Fed as a percentage of earning assets which had about a 7 basis point negative
impact on the NIM, compared to the previous quarter.
Lower interest costs in the quarter reduced these negatives by about 2 basis points. The taxable equivalent loan
yield for the third quarter was 3.73%, down 22 basis points from the previous quarter. The decrease in yield was
impacted by decreases in LIBOR during the quarter, as about two thirds of our loan portfolio excluding PPP is
made up of floating rate loans and about 60% of our floating rate loans are tied to LIBOR.
The PPP loan portfolio also had a negative effect on our loan yield, as compared to the second quarter. During
the third quarter, we extended the expected term of the PPP portfolio somewhat which results in a yield on the
PPP portfolio of 3.65% during the third quarter as compared to 4.13% in the second quarter. This had a 9 basis
point negative impact on the comparison between the second and third quarter reported total loan yields.
Looking at our investment portfolio, the total investment portfolio averaged $12.7 billion during the third quarter,
up about $180 million from the second quarter average of $12.5 billion. The taxable equivalent yield on the
investment portfolio was 3.44% in the third quarter, down 9 basis points from the second quarter. The decrease in
the portfolio yield was driven by a decrease in the yield on our taxable portfolio.
The yield on that portfolio, which averaged $4.2 billion during the quarter, was down 19 basis points from the
second quarter to 2.21% as a result of higher premium amortization associated with our agency MBS securities,
given faster prepayment speeds and lower yields associated with recent purchases. Our municipal portfolio
averaged about $8.5 billion during the third quarter, flat with the second quarter with the taxable equivalent yield
of 4.08%, up 1 basis point from the prior quarter.
At the end of the third quarter 78% of the municipal portfolio was pre-refunded or PSF insured. The duration of the
investment portfolio at the end of the third quarter was 4.5 years, up slightly from 4.4 years last quarter.
Regarding non-interest expense, for the third quarter, I'll point out that the salaries line item includes about $4.5
million in reductions in salary expense associated with truing up our incentive plans based on current
expectations of projected payouts for the year.
As Phil mentioned, in this environment, we continue to focus on managing our discretionary spending and looking
for ways to operate more efficiently. Looking at the full year 2020, our previous guidance on expenses was at
adding back to deferred expenses related to PPP loans, we expected an annual expense growth of something
around 6%. Our current expectations would reduce that to something around the 3% range.
With that I'll now turn the call back over to Phil for questions.

Hey, Brady.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yeah. I wanted to start with the dynamics of the PPP loans. I know last quarter I believe I remember you
recognized about 20% of those PPP fees. It sounds like if you've extended the assumed duration of that portfolio,
maybe it was less than that in the third quarter. But how much was realized in the third quarter of the PPP loans?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think the number was pretty comparable. We did put some additional loans on during the third quarter and we
did extend the expected life there, just a little bit more than we expected originally. But I think that the amount that
we've recognized in the second quarter associated with that fee was in the $21 million range. So, really pretty
comparable with the second quarter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And I know you guys have been talking about the full year NIM ex-PPP coming in a little above 3%. You're
three quarters of the way through. So, we're getting close. Is that still the right way to think about the full year NIM
for you guys?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I think at this point that's kind of what we're at based on what we're seeing so far. I think that third quarter
probably gives you a pretty good feel. It's kind of the projection for the rest of the year, given just that we've got
one quarter left and that'll get us I think that's kind of the range that we – guidance that we've given for this for the
quarter, excuse me for the year.

Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then finally for me, we have seen some companies, especially some smaller banks there in Texas re-
engage in the buyback. Was that as deferrals come down and maybe you guys feel a little more comfortable, is
that something that you're thinking about doing re-engaging in the share repurchase plan?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Brady, right now it's not something that's on our radar screen immediately. As you know it has been over time and
I suspect at some point it will – we will re-engage. But right now in the environment, we're focused on dividend
protecting that, providing capital for the growth that we're seeing so. But at some point, yeah, it will come back.

less the 7.5% roughly in deferred expenses you mentioned?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. It's from the reported 2019 number right. And so, we're adding back the $7 million in deferrals that we
talked about in the second quarter...

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
...to our 2020 number, so yeah, I think you're thinking about it right, Dave.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.
Got you. Okay. I just want to make sure there. And then on NIM, is the thinking that effectively the NIM will
probably continue to distrust lower from here ex the PPP fee amortization, assuming the curve persists maybe
even through next year as loans and securities continue to re-price? And then what does that ultimately mean for
the NII trend over time. Do you guys think that you can grow NII with that kind of a NIM headwind?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think as far as you know your view of the NIM, I mean that's really kind of where we're at right now. Obviously,
there's not a lot of opportunities to invest. We've got – I think between $6 billion and $7 billion at the Fed on any
given day and earning 10 basis points and there's just not a lot of opportunities out on the yield curve right now.
We continue to say we're going to be opportunistic and we pay attention. But we've got quite a bit of liquidity and
that's probably true for a lot of our competitors, but just not ready to stick our toes in the water as of yet. So, there
would be some potential there.
Phil mentioned that loan pricing is still obviously competitive as a structure. So, I think your view that it's going to
be a tough road especially in 2021, given this sort of a rate environment, I think that I have to agree with you that
there is some potential to grow the net interest income like we said to the extent that we decided to invest some of
that liquidity.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.
Yeah. Where are you seeing reinvestment rates today? I know you mentioned they were lower and that makes
perfect sense. Just curious where they are right now?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Oh, man, I'm almost embarrassed to grab my files to be quite honest with you. Yeah, I think the mortgage back –
I'll go to the MBSs that we purchased during the quarter, just to give you a range there. Bear with me a second
here. So, I think we were buying a mortgage backed or see here the agencies that we bought were at $1.53 and I
don't think we could get that today to be quite honest with you. And as you heard me say, they're prepaying pretty
quickly. I think on the Muni side, we were looking at some 10-year stuff that's probably in the $1.39 $1.35 PE sort
of range. So, that's not too good.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2020
Yeah. No, I hear you. I mean, is there a thought to just keep the securities book stable from here, or maybe grow
it a little bit over time just to support NII a little bit to the extent that maybe loan growth doesn't come roaring
back?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah, I think that's kind of the view that we're taking. Again, we keep saying that we're going to be opportunistic.
We wish that we had other opportunities, but you're right. I mean, we will do something. We'll kind of hold our
nose, if you will and decide to spend some of it, but we really don't feel like it's a place we want to be in right now
to be quite honest with you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.
Yeah. And maybe just switching to the one pipeline that was positive to hear that was up 11% since last quarter.
Where are you guys seeing the increase in activity there? And then you've again mentioned the pickup in
competition was just wondering which areas you're seeing competitive pressures the most and if you're actually
seeing spreads compressing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. Well, if you look at the that 11% on a linked quarter basis, not annualize, it's spread pretty evenly,
commercial real estate activity is up 19% in terms of pipeline and commercial C&I is up by 8%. The dollar amount
of both of those is pretty comparable. And so that's really where we're seeing on it. In terms of competition, you
are seeing pricing pressure return. We're not losing a lot of pricing, because once we get to a customer that we
think meets all our criteria that we want to have a long term relationship, we don't want to lose it for a few basis
points.
I think it's one real interesting area to me that we've seen is the increase in deals that we've lost to structure. If
you look at, I'll give you two numbers, one is, if you look at large C&I loans which we define large as over $10
million, 92% of the deals we've lost have been to structure. And if you look at commercial real estate deals to
prospects, we are losing – the deals we're losing, we're losing 92% interestingly the same number, 92% to
structure there as well.
So, no I think it's been a bit of a turnaround quarter for us from the second quarter, obviously that was a really
tough quarter. But to see the 11% growth in pipeline was good. Also another thing we look at is what we call our
loan to book and our ratio there. If you look year-to-date compared to last year, we've looked at about 6% more
deals that is we had opportunities to look at a loan request and actual request. And we're up in terms of booking
by 11%.
So, we're doing a pretty good job of booking the deals that we're seeing. So, it's a tough market. Any time you see
that much loss to structure mix you worry a little bit, it's mainly guarantees, its advance rates, its amortization
periods, all those kinds of things. But even with all that, I'm pretty happy with our success rate that we're having.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I just wanted to follow up one on just expenses and investments. So, Jerry, I think your guidance implies
expenses go back around $225 million, plus or minus in the fourth quarter. Just talk to us in terms of when we
look at the investments that you have ongoing in terms of the financial centers, obviously the tightening on the
comp side. How should we think about expenses going into next year, where you're going to continue to have the
margin pressure, just what's the best way to think about it internally, how is management thinking about that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Sure. I think that Phil gave you a little bit of a view of how management is looking at it and I'll defer to him a little
bit, let him talk and I'll follow up after his conversation.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, I gave the example where our management teams decided to cut our salaries back 10% and the
bonuses target levels what I mentioned. No, we did that as – because we've recognized that we need to be – take
a leadership position with regard to efficiencies. There's work really the industry needs to do. We certainly need to
do on top of what we've done already. And that's just the beginning of the process. We're beginning our planning
for next year for the budget. And this is one of the early decisions that we're making.
I think it was really interesting and I was really proud by the way, I should mention this of yesterday in our board
meeting, when I mentioned that to the board that that was our decision and their time when they have at the end
of every meeting where they have their private session, they decided unilaterally to decrease their cash
compensation by 10% to which I thought was a really Frost thing to do. So, I think you're seeing leadership at the
top including our board and our commitment to see increased efficiencies.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
No, that's commendable. I guess maybe ask differently, do you think – you mentioned focus on positive operating
leverage, do you think the efficiency ratio can actually improve in this backdrop, or do you think that's going to be
challenging?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Do you think the efficiency ratio can improve from your – in the current backdrop?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, I think as Phil mentioned, we are starting our process and obviously, we've had a lot of
conversations. And so, we know what we've committed to the board and so we've got a lot of work to do there.
We don't have all the plans in place, so I'd feel a little uncomfortable giving too much guidance. We'll give more
color obviously in January. What we want all of you to know is, we're taking it all very seriously and we
understand the revenue pressure that we're under and we're looking for all the efficiencies that we can.
And some tough decisions will be made and we'll have to make them and we'll just continue to move forward
there. As far as what we're doing in Houston, we've committed to doing that. Phil has said that all along and we're
making significant progress there. They're performing better than expected, so we'll continue to move there. We're
not going to slow that down at all. We may open a couple of locations here and there, but we're obviously going to
be very, very prudent in what we do from that standpoint.
There's going to be cost, so we have to spend whether that's from a technology standpoint, whether its
infrastructure, whether its security related to technology. So, we know we have some costs to spend there, but we
also understand that in order to do that we've got to do things more efficiently and that's the sort of conversations
that the executive team is in the middle of right now.

Got it. And I guess just shifting to Phil, give us a sense of – so you talked about like loan pipeline, there are some
signs things look encouraging. Just give us a sense of what's the ground reality in terms of the economic outlook
once we get to the elections next week? As you think about next year, are you more optimistic today in terms of
what growth could look like relative to the headlines that we see or are you more cautious?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I'd respond two ways with two items to that question. One is, I think that the election getting it behind everyone is
going to be a real positive, whichever way it goes it's just going to add more clarity. In the calls, we've done with
customers, there's been more uncertainty around that than anything else. And so, I think once we can get past
that I think attitudes will steal themselves and we'll move forward. I think the thing that makes me most optimistic
11

(CFR) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2020 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2020
going for Cullen is that I don't want to blow past that number too fast and we've seen new relationships up by
38%, almost 39% compared to where it was last year.
I mean, we go along at about, I'm going to guess something like $450 a quarter in the commercial side. For the
last two quarters, they've been in the high $770s and well, all those – not all those relationships by far are
borrowing money, because there's lots of uncertainty today whether it's from politics, whether it's from elections,
whether it's from COVID for sure and the health situation. I mean, those relationships are what generate growth
for us going forward. And so, that's the thing that makes me most positive.
Another thing I'm positive about is, just when you look at Houston. Again, we've been spending money and our
shareholders have been patient. And it's a long-term strategy and all. But when I look at our loan pipeline, our
active pipeline, the Houston market is 50% higher and their loan pipeline than any of our other markets and the
other markets aren't doing bad. So, we're just seeing payoff for that investment in that market. And I'm
encouraged about that as well.
We'll finish up that plan for that first 25. We had hoped to be through by the end of this year. I mean, what's a two
or three are going to bleed over into the early next year, but it's understandable given that COVID environment,
everything else. So we'll be through that. We've hired some great people and I'm just really excited about what's
going on there. So, I am optimistic about our prospects going forward. I mean, look, rates are terrible and we're
big, we've got a big investment portfolio, lots of liquidity.
Can't do anything about that, but as far as the part we can do something about, I am optimistic on how things are
going right now. Now that said, the virus has got to, we've got to win on the virus, right. And as a nation, as world
we got to win on it. And if it gets worse or they shut things down things will get worse, hopefully we won't see that
and we'll be able to move past that next year. If we can do that, then I am optimistic for the coming year.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q

Got it. And I'm sorry if I missed it. So, did you mention who you are losing these loans to on structure, are these
other banks or are these non-bank financiers, who are stepping in?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Ebrahim, I haven't heard that it's non-banks. I mean, there are some of those out there. Usually, when I've heard
reports on this, it's everywhere, right. It could be small banks, large banks, banks our size, it could be private
equity. I haven't heard anything different. So, I think it's pretty broadly based. People are starving for yield and it
doesn't surprise me that it's getting more competitive.

Jennifer Demba Q
Analyst, Truist Securities, Inc.
Hi. Your fee income was [indiscernible] (00:33:22) from the second quarter. Do you think these [indiscernible]
(00:33:27) have a good run rate going forward and could you expect pretty healthy growth again in the fourth
quarter or do you think that that incremental improvement is kind of slowing down?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think that – yeah, we were glad and I think in the second quarter call we said that we were starting to see in July
that some of those accounts, especially as it related to service charges on deposits were a big component of that
is OD, NSF and then the interchange fees and debit card fees there was trending up and we did continue to see
improvement there in the third quarter. A lot of it, as Phil mentioned, really is going to depend on what happens
from an economic standpoint with the pandemic. I think the numbers that we're seeing in October are a little bit
softer than the growth that we've been seeing in the third quarter. So it'll be interesting to see how it plays out, but
numbers are better. But again we're not seeing that same sort of accelerated rate that we saw during the second
quarter.

[indiscernible] (00:34:45) Peter.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
You guys had a just a small addition to reserves. I was just wondering if you could talk about what drove the
increase to reserves and do you think at this point you're done at least on building reserves?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think that really the increase in reserves, a big portion of it I think was related to the energy book. The models
indicated that we needed some additional dollars there and then also some of the work we did in management
overlays in the oilfield services side of the book showed some increases there. So I think our specific reserves in
energy, for example, were like $2.3 million in the second quarter up to $8.4 million. So I think that's where we saw
the bulk of the increase and it was really related like I said to specific work associated I think with – primarily with
the oilfield services.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Right.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
And would you say you're done, you think, at this point, building reserves?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
I think that obviously that really has a lot to do with kind of what happens. But I will say that obviously we feel very
comfortable with where we're at today. We – when you looked at our provisions, you can see that we're down
from the second quarter. You saw the charge-offs were down to $10 million. That's 22 basis points on average
loans. That's much closer to our normalized levels that we typically like to run. So I think we're certainly feeling
positive about it, but still cautious to be honest. I think anybody that didn't say they're cautious in this environment
would be somewhat misleading. So we feel good obviously of where we are, but continue to be cautiously
optimistic going forward. Phil, any other color you want to add?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
No, I would agree with Jerry. The weakness I think we're seeing in the energy sector is around service because
it's – there's not a lot of activity there. The weakness is – the rate – that – rate of that weakness has slowed. The
equipment utilization number is down, but it's not down by near as much as what it was before. But still you got to
service people that are under pressure. We've, by and large and historically performed pretty well in service and
really it's not that big a part of our portfolio, it's under $200 million, again probably under $170 million. But it's
something that we're watching. I think the bottom line is kind of what we've been saying and what Jerry said
earlier, it's what's going to – what's demand going to do and what's COVID going to do to demand. If we end up
locking the place down again, you're going to see demand numbers go down and you'll see price – prices reduce
and you could see problems increase. But we – we've been able to manage fair amount of stability recently. And
we're – and I feel good about the people that we've banked and our structures and the work that our people are

doing, working with our customers. So [indiscernible] (00:37:52) just have to see how it goes from now.
Unfortunately, like everything else, I think at some level it all still revolves around the virus and how we do there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's fair enough. And then if I can just follow up on expenses, you guys have come in better on expenses
now two quarters in a row and then the guidance that you gave implies that there is going be a big jump in the
fourth quarter. Can you talk about what's driving the increase? I know you mentioned the $4.5 million on the
incentive accruals, but what's driving that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Right. Yeah. So there are certain things that happen in the fourth quarter for – some stock compensation awards
that occur in October that vest immediately and so we deal with those expenses in the fourth quarter. So we're
dealing with that. We've also got some decisions that need to be made as it relates to marketing expenses, for
example, related to advertising and how much do we want to do. And we want to be sensitive to that even while
managing expenses. Obviously we think that we want to be dutiful and diligent in how we spend those dollars.
We've had a lot of success in Houston, so we want to make sure that we do what we need to do. So some of
those decisions are still being made. As we talked about, the executive team is looking a lot at open positions that
would be filled in the fourth quarter and whether those need to be filled in. So those project – that projection is
really based on our best information, but we continue to spend time not only on looking at how we can be more
efficient in the 2021. Some of that will go in to the fourth quarter of this year also, but right now, the guidance
we've given is based on the best information we have.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Got it. Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
We're going to do things that we need to do. Obviously, we've talked about, as many others have, about branch
locations, do we need to make decisions about closing branches that may be not as profitable or necessary.
We're building new branches obviously in Houston and have others in the plan and so, we just want to make sure
that things that we do make sense to us organizationally, so we'll do what we need to do. And some of the work
that we're doing will affect the fourth quarter. But at this point we don't have those commitments tied up.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q

Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Hey, Steve.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
So first, I had a big picture question. So when I think about Cullen/Frost, I've always thought about you guys as a
company that plays a long game, right? You invest in the franchise, take great care of your employees, your
customers, et cetera. I'm somewhat surprised by the expense initiative. Can you talk about what prompted that?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Which initiative are you talking about, Steve? Are you talking just generally, are you talking about something
specific, I just want to make I'm answering your direct question.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
No, I mean well you talked about reducing your own salaries, right, improving efficiency...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
...for next year. I mean we've been through periods before where you've had revenue pressure and I don't recall a
message like this before. It seems somewhat new. And I'm curious what prompted [indiscernible] (00:41:11)
yourself, from the board, like what prompted this? It seems to be a bit of a shift strategically.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Yeah. I wouldn't – I don't think of it that way. First of all, it didn't come from the board. This is coming from our
management team. Like I said, I had – I talked to the board about it yesterday. I convinced them this is the right
thing to do and they came back and reduced their own. So we're all of one mind on this. I think one of the things
that's different about – let's take 2008, all right? 2008, we had the financial crisis. We were not in mortgage. We
had the opportunity – because we had liquidity, we had earnings, we had taxable income, we had the ability to go
into the municipal market which was not a part of QE at that time and get some incredible yields in investments
during that period of time and really through the 8-plus years after that – 10 years or so after that. Those kind of
opportunities are not available.
We see this as a longer period of time for the banking industry where you've got, not just low short-term rates,
which has happened in the past, but you've got low long-term rates and you've got the COVID environment and
the uncertainty around all that. And we just – we're just doing our job. We are protecting our earnings stream. We
are doing what we're asking our customers to do which is make sure that your business is running efficiently and
you're able to take care of your obligations. So it's just part of our culture. It's a part of integrity, caring and
excellence.

Q3 2020 Earnings Call 29-Oct-2020
We do what is necessary to play the long game. And believe me this is a long game. It's so long that I remember
back to the 1980s. So when you go back there you look at some of the things that we had to do, this is nothing
compared to that. I was essentially CFO during that period of time and my job was to sell everything
[indiscernible] (00:43:35) down that could generate any capital because there was a big red line drawn around
Texas and there was no capital for nobody in this state. And Dick Evans and the lending guys, his job was to work
out loans over time.
So as I recall I think I got one raise in six years back during that period of time. So it's – you go back to the Great
Depression or the money panic of the early 1900s, you name it, this organization has responded and done what
we need to do. So our view on this is it's consistent with what we've done over the long-term and it's also
consistent with the long-term view of the company because we need to show – we need, as an industry, to
continue to be more efficient to apply the lessons that we've learned and the things that we have been able to do,
some of them on the fly that have made us very efficient. We need to make sure that we're applying those lessons
going forward and look it's part of our culture to do the right thing to not just say what to do but [indiscernible]
(00:44:47). And if you're not able to show with your actions what you mean, then it's really just empty words. So
that's what this is about.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And when you think about next year, what's the right measure that you're after? Is it to
actually improve the efficiency ratio year-over-year? Is it to show [ph] pre pre growth (00:45:08)? Like how are you
going to measure how much needs to get done?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
It's directional. And what we're seeing, as Jerry has talked about, is we're seeing pressure on revenues, and so if
your revenues are under pressure and if the fed's telling you that they could be for some time, then what you need
to do is you need to make sure that you rationalize your expenses around those revenues and that's what we're
doing. And it's a directional process and it's beginning and it's something that we're always careful on, on
expenses as we've talked about. We are culturally careful on that. We've got a conservative corporate culture, but
we just – we're in a situation where revenues we think will be under pressure for the industry for a – possibly a
couple years and we [indiscernible] (00:46:02) strategy.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
That's very helpful. And just finally, and we've seen other banks undertake efficiency initiatives, quite a few of
them have done it with the help of outside consultants, are you bringing somebody in from the outside to help out
with this?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Phillip D. Green A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Oh, heck, no. We've – in my 40 years here that – we've done that before, my experience with those has been
they're very short-term in nature. They are – they're expensive to shareholders and they end up telling you –
taking your watch and telling you what time it is. What we're talking about doing is really doing deep dive, thinking
– we call it – we want to be smart about our business. We want to do the right thing. Do things that are lasting,
long-term and with the view in all this to make – to keep and improve the customer experience. That's – we're not
17

interested in doing anything that devalues our value proposition and our customer experience, because that's
really what is so key to our growth and success. So – and my experience with consultancies around expenses
don't have that same view.

Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, thanks for taking the follow-up, guys. I just wanted to ask, we'll see what happens, but Biden is leading in the
polls right now. He's talking about increasing the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. If that pans out, do you
have any idea what the impact would be to Cullen – Cullen/Frost tax rate at a 28% corporate tax rate?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jerry Salinas A
Group Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.
Brady, of course, all that's going to be dependent on what taxable income is, right? The simple way to do it, if
you're modeling it – for us, it's really pretty simple. It's just a third increase. If you think it's going to be 9%, you'd
raise it by a third to 12%. It's really almost as simple as that. But, obviously it's going to be dependent on what the
forecast is for pre-tax earnings.
