Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. I'm going to begin on slide 4. I am very pleased with our results for
the fiscal second quarter and the first half for the fiscal year, especially given the challenging market conditions.
We continue to invest in growth across all of our businesses. In the Private Client Group, excellent retention and
recruiting of financial advisors contributed to best-in-class growth with domestic net new assets of 11% over the
12-month period. Furthermore, the Charles Stanley acquisition, which closed during the quarter, significantly
expanded our presence in the UK, which is a very attractive market for wealth management.
In the Capital Markets business, while investment banking revenues were negatively impacted by the heightened
market volatility during the quarter, we continue to see strong pipelines as the expertise we have both added
organically and through niche acquisitions has been performing extremely well.
In the Fixed Income business, we announced the pending acquisition of SumRidge Partners during the quarter,
which will enhance our platform with technology-driven capabilities and a fantastic team with extensive
experience in dealing with corporates.
Raymond James Bank grew loans an impressive 7% during the quarter, reflecting attractive growth across all the
loan categories. The TriState Capital acquisition, which is expected to close by the end of our fiscal third quarter,
will add a best-in-class third-party securities-based lending capability while also diversifying our funding sources.
They will also bring a diversified asset manager in Chartwell, which will be a great addition to our multi-boutique
model in Asset Management. So as we always do in any market cycle, we continue to invest for the long term,
always putting clients first.
It's in uncertain market conditions such as these that remind us the importance of focusing on and making
decisions for the long term. While our strategy may not always be popular over short-term periods, today, I
believe, we are well-positioned for the expected increases in short-term rates with record clients' domestic cash
sweep balances, strong loan growth at Raymond James Bank, high concentration of floating assets, and an
ample balance sheet flexibility given solid capital ratios, which are all well in excess of regulatory requirements.
Turning to results. In the fiscal second quarter, the firm reported net revenues of $2.67 billion, a net income of
$323 million or earnings per diluted share of $1.52. Despite higher asset management and related administrative
fees reflecting the strong year-over-year growth in PCG assets in fee-based accounts, diluted EPS declined 10%
compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to bank loan loss provisions for credit losses during the current

quarter to support the strong loan growth compared to a benefit in the prior-year quarter. This quarter also had a
higher effective tax rate, which Paul Shoukry will explain later on the call.
Excluding $11 million of acquisition-related expenses, quarterly adjusted net income was $331 million or earnings
per diluted share of $1.55. Annualized return on equity for the quarter was 15%, and adjusted annualized return
on tangible common equity was 17.2%, an impressive result, especially in this very low rate environment and
given our strong capital position.
Moving to slide 5. We ended the quarter with total assets under administration of $1.26 trillion and record PCG
assets in fee-based accounts of $678 billion. These figures include the assets from the acquisition of Charles
Stanley, which was completed on January 21. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, total client assets under
administration declined 2.8% compared to the immediately preceding quarter. Financial assets under
management of $194 billion decreased 5% sequentially as net inflows were more than offset by declines in equity
markets during the quarter.
We ended the quarter with a record 8,730 financial advisors, a net increase of 403 over the prior-year period and
266 over the preceding quarter, which includes the 200 Charles Stanley financial advisors. Our focus on
supporting advisors and their clients has led us to strong results in terms of advisor retention, as well as recruiting
experienced advisors to the Raymond James platform throughout our multiple affiliation options.
Over the trailing 12-month period ending March 31, 2022, we recruited to our domestic independent contractor
and employee channels financial advisors with approximately $340 million of trailing 12 production and
approximately $53 billion of client assets at their previous firms.
And highlighting our industry leading growth, we generated domestic PCG net new assets of approximately $106
billion over the four quarters ending March 31, 2022, representing approximately 11% of domestic PCG assets at
the beginning of the period. Second quarter domestic PCG net new asset growth was nearly 9% annualized.
Client domestic cash sweep balances grew 4% sequentially to a record $76.5 billion. Raymond James Bank
continued to generate impressive loan growth, up 22% year-over-year and 7% during the quarter to a record
$27.9 billion. This growth was driven by securities-based loans and residential mortgages largely to PCG clients
as well as strong corporate loan growth.
Now moving on to the results on slide 6. The Private Client Group generated quarterly net revenues of $1.92
billion and pre-tax income of $213 million. On a year-over-year basis, revenues grew 17% and pre-tax income
grew 11%, primarily driven by higher assets in fee-based accounts. The Capital Markets segment generated
quarterly net revenues of $413 million and pre-tax income of $87 million. Capital Markets revenues declined 5%
over the prior-year period, primarily driven by lower fixed income brokerage revenue and equity underwriting
revenues. Sequentially, quarterly net revenues decreased 33%, driven by lower investment banking revenues,
primarily due to the impact of increased geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties.
As I referenced earlier in March, we announced the acquisition of SumRidge Partners, a technology-driven fixed
income market maker specializing in investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds, municipal bonds and
institutional preferred securities. This acquisition is further evidence of our continued commitment to providing
cutting-edge technology to advisors, clients and stakeholders. We currently anticipate the acquisition to close in
the fourth quarter of 2022, subject to regulatory approval.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
The Asset Management segment generated net revenues of $234 million and pre-tax income of $103 million. On
a year-over-year basis, revenues grew 12% and pre-tax income grew 18% over the fiscal second quarter of 2021,
primarily a result of higher assets under management.
Raymond James Bank generated quarterly net revenues of $197 million and pre-tax income of $83 million. Net
revenue growth was primarily due to higher asset balances as the bank generated attractive growth in its loan
portfolio, along with net interest margin expansion. Despite revenue growth, pre-tax income declined 25%
compared to a year-ago quarter caused by the bank's loan loss provision for credit losses in the current quarter,
reflecting strong loan growth compared to the bank's loan benefit for credit losses in comparative periods.
Looking to the fiscal year-to-date results on slide 7, we generated record net revenues of $5.45 billion during the
first six months of fiscal 2022, up 19% over the same period a year ago. Record earnings per diluted share of
$3.61 increased 14% compared to the first six months of fiscal 2021. Additionally, we generated strong
annualized return on equity of 18.1% and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of 20.6% for the
six-month period.
Moving to the fiscal year-to-date segment results on slide 8, the Private Client Group, Capital Markets and Asset
Management segments, all generated record net revenues and record pre-tax income during the first six months
of the fiscal year, again, reinforcing the value of our diverse and complementary businesses.
Now, for a detailed review of our second quarter financial results, I will turn the call over to Paul Shoukry. Paul?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Thanks, Paul. Starting with consolidated revenues on slide 10. Quarterly net revenues of $2.67 billion grew 13%
year-over-year and declined 4% sequentially. Record asset management fees grew 25% over the prior year's
fiscal second quarter and 6% over the preceding quarter. Private Client Group assets in fee-based accounts
ended the quarter relatively unchanged compared to December 2021. However, adjusting for the acquired assets
of Charles Stanley, PCG assets in fee-based accounts declined approximately 3%, creating a headwind for Asset
Management revenues in the fiscal third quarter. So, I would expect somewhere around a 3% sequential decline
in this line item in the upcoming fiscal third quarter. I'll discuss account and service fees and net interest income
shortly.
Skipping ahead to investment banking revenues, as Paul described, this line item declined significantly compared
to the preceding quarter. But at $235 million, it was still a very strong quarter compared to our results prior to
fiscal 2021. Given the heightened market volatility, we would not be surprised to match this quarter's results for
the next two quarters, which would result in the investment banking revenues ending fiscal 2022 close to the
record set in fiscal 2021. While our pipelines are strong, there's a lot of uncertainty over the next two quarters that
could impact investment banking revenues positively or negatively for the rest of the fiscal year.
Other revenues of $27 million were down 47% compared to the preceding quarter, primarily due to lower
revenues from affordable housing investments, previously known as tax credit funds. The pipeline for the
business is very strong, but the timing of closings is more uncertain, given the rapid cost increases impacting
affordable housing developers.
Moving to slide 11. Clients' domestic cash sweep balances ended the quarter at a record $76.5 billion, up $3
billion or 4% over the preceding quarter and representing 7% of domestic PCG client assets. Notably, $17 billion
or 22% of total cash sweep balances are held in the Client Interest Program, the vast majority of which are

invested in very short-term treasuries and could be redeployed to generate much higher yields over time, either at
our own bank or with third-party banks as interest rates increase and demand for cash balances recover.
Turning to slide 12, combined net interest income and BDP fees from third-party banks was $224 million, up a
robust 9% from the preceding quarter. This growth is largely a result of strong asset growth and a higher net
interest margin at Raymond James Bank, which increased 9 basis points to 2.01% for the quarter.
The increase of the bank's NIM during the quarter was attributable to a higher-yielding asset mix given the strong
loan growth as the March interest rate increase really won't start benefiting the bank's NIM until the fiscal third
quarter. For example, following the March rate increase, the bank's current spot NIM is around 2.15%. The
average yield on RJBDP balances with third-party banks increased to 32 basis points in the quarter, and the spot
rate is just over 50 basis points, reflecting the March rate increase.
Both the NIM and the average yield from third-party banks are expected to increase further, with additional rate
increases as less than 25% of the firm's interest earning assets have fixed rates and those assets have an
average effective duration of less than four years and all of the deposit sweep relationships with third-party banks
are floating rate contracts. So, we should have significant upside from rising short-term interest rates.
To that point, let me walk through how we are positioned to rising short-term interest rates. Based on current
clients' domestic cash sweep balances, which decreased by over $2 billion to $74 billion thus far in April, largely
due to the quarterly fee billings and income tax payments, using static balances and an instantaneous 100-basis-
point increase in short-term interest rates, which includes the 25-basis-point rate increase in March, we would
expect incremental pre-tax income of nearly $600 million per year with approximately 65% of that reflected as net
interest income and 35% reflected as account and service fees. This estimate assumes a blended deposit beta of
around 15% for the first 100-basis-point increase, commensurate with what we experienced in the last rate cycle.
Importantly, this analysis does not incorporate the TriState Capital acquisition, which should provide incremental
upside to higher short-term interest rates as the vast majority of their $13 billion of balance sheet assets are also
floating rate assets as they have always shared a similar approach to limiting duration risk.
Moving to consolidated expenses on slide 13, starting with our largest expense, compensation. The
compensation ratio for the quarter was 69.3%, which increased from 67.7% in the preceding quarter but remained
below the year-ago period compensation ratio of 69.5% and below our 70% target in a low-interest rate
environment.
The sequential increase was mainly the result of lower capital markets revenues, which led to the revenue mix
shift towards higher compensable revenues in the PCG segment as advisor payouts, particularly to independent
advisors who cover their own overhead expenses, are typically higher than the associated compensation of our
other businesses.
On a sequential basis, the compensation ratio was also impacted by the reset of payroll taxes that occurs in the
first calendar quarter of each year, as well as annual salary increases and continued hiring to support our growth.
Non-compensation expenses of $388 million increased 14% sequentially, predominantly driven by the bank loan
provision for credit losses compared to a loan loss release in the preceding quarter, as well as higher
communication and information processing expenses. Excluding the bank loan provision in acquisition-related
expenses, which creates some noise in the comparison, non-compensation expenses of $356 million grew 3%
over the preceding quarter.

Also keep in mind, expenses included just over two months of results for Charles Stanley, which closed on
January 21. So, overall, we have remained focused on the disciplined management of all compensation and non-
compensation-related expenses while still investing in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisors and
their clients.
Slide 14 shows a pre-tax margin trend over the past five quarters. In the fiscal second quarter, we generated a
pre-tax margin of 16.2% and an adjusted pre-tax margin of 16.6%, in line with our 16% target in this low interest
rate environment. Based on the expectation for the additional increases in short-term interest rates, we will revisit
our pre-tax margin and compensation ratio targets at our upcoming Analyst and Investor Day scheduled for May
25. Hopefully by then, we will have more clarity on other important variables such as the outlook for investment
banking revenues, the level of business development expenses as conferences and travel continue to ramp up
and the impact of recently closed and pending acquisitions.
On slide 15, at the end of the quarter, total assets were $73.1 billion, a 7% sequential increase, reflecting the
addition of approximately $3 billion in assets, mostly segregated client cash balances from Charles Stanley, as
well as solid growth of loans at Raymond James Bank. Liquidity and capital remained very strong. RJF corporate
cash at the parent ended the quarter at $2.2 billion, increasing 59% during the quarter primarily due to significant
special dividends from our well-capitalized subsidiaries during the quarter. The total capital ratio of 25% and a
Tier 1 leverage ratio of 11.1% are both more than double the regulatory requirements to be well-capitalized,
providing significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in growth.
The effective tax rate for the quarter did increase to 25.4%, up from 20.1% in the preceding quarter. The primary
drivers of the sequential increase are the favorable impact from share-based compensation that vested in the
preceding quarter and non-deductible losses on our corporate-owned life insurance portfolio due to equity
markets that are used to fund our non-qualified benefit plans, compared to a non-taxable gains on these portfolios
in the preceding quarter.
Slide 16 provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters. As of April 27, 2022, $1 billion
remains available under the board-approved share repurchase authorization. Due to regulatory restrictions, we do
not expect to repurchase common shares until after closing the TriState Capital Holdings acquisition, currently
expected to occur by the end of the fiscal third quarter.
As we explained on prior calls, our current plan is to offset the share issuances associated with the transaction
after closing. But given the heightened market volatility, we'll obviously keep a watchful eye on market conditions
between now and then.
Lastly, on slide 17, we provide key credit metrics for Raymond James Bank. The credit quality of the bank's loan
portfolio remains healthy with most trends continuing to improve. The bank loan loss provision of $21 million was
primarily driven by strong loan growth during the quarter. The bank loan allowance for credit losses as a
percentage of loans held for investment ended the quarter at 1.17%, down from 1.5% at March 2021 and
essentially unchanged from 1.18% at December 2021.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Paul Reilly to discuss our outlook. Paul?

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
Thank you, Paul. As I said at the start of the call, I am pleased with our results. And while there are many
uncertainties, I believe we are well-positioned to drive growth across all our businesses. In the Private Client
Group, next quarter results will be negatively impacted by the expected 3% sequential decline of asset
management and related administrative fees that Paul described earlier.
However, focusing more long term, our recruiting pipelines remain strong. And combined with solid retention, I am
optimistic we will continue delivering industry leading growth as advisors are attracted to our client-focused values
and leading technology platform.
Furthermore, the addition of Charles Stanley provides an opportunity to accelerate our growth in the UK wealth
management market through multiple affiliation options similar to our AdvisorChoice offerings in the US and
Canada.
In the Capital Markets segment, M&A pipeline remains robust, but closings will be heavily influenced by market
conditions throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. And while market uncertainty and geopolitical concerns
loom in the near future, I am confident we have made significant investments over the past five years to
strengthen our platform and to grow our team and productive capacity, positioning us well to grow over the long
term.
In the Fixed Income space, although depository clients are still flush with cash and searching for yield optimization
opportunities, we expect results to be more volatile over the next few quarters given elevated interest rate
uncertainty. Additionally, we expect the pending acquisition of SumRidge Partners to enhance our current position
in the rapidly evolving fixed income and trading technology marketplace.
In the Asset Management segment, while the financial assets under management are starting the fiscal third
quarter lower due to equity markets, we are confident that strong growth of our assets in fee-based accounts in
the Private Client Group segment will drive long-term growth of financial assets under management.
In addition, upon the close of TriState Capital, we expect Chartwell Investment Partners, which will operate as a
subsidiary of Carillon Tower Associates, to help drive further growth through increased scale, distribution and
operational and market synergies.
And Raymond James Bank should continue to grow as we have ample funding and capital to grow the balance
sheet. Raymond James Bank is well-positioned for rising short-term rates and we expect TriState Capital to
further enhance this benefit to the firm, given their floating rate asset concentration and their leading position in
third-party SBL business.
Before closing, I want to call your attention to our annual corporate responsibility report that was released during
the quarter. The report, which can be found on our Investor Relations website, highlights our foundational
commitments to our people, sustainability, community and governance, and illustrates our long-standing approach
to doing business, rooted in our values and brought to life through our people-driven culture.
This report summarizes many of the inspiring things that our advisors and associates across the firm do to
contribute to their communities and the things we do as a firm to help the environment. As always and foremost, I
want to thank our advisors and their associates for their perseverance and dedication to providing excellent
service to their clients each and every day.
With that, operator, please open the line up for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] And we'll proceed with our first question on the line from
Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead with your question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. So, I wanted to start with the question around
capital. You guys saw the Tier 1 leverage drop down over 100 basis points quarter-over-quarter at the holding
company level. It looks like it's all coming from the broker-dealer. The cash balances picked up there and liabilities
did as well. So maybe flesh out a little bit sort of what happened, what drove the increase this quarter that's kind
of weighing on Tier 1 leverage a bit here. And then more importantly, is that something you expect to reverse
pretty quickly? And I guess regardless, should we still expect you guys to buy back all the stock that you expect to
issue on the back of TriState closing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks, Alex. I think before going into sort of the quarter-to-quarter movements, just stepping back at 11%
Tier 1 leverage ratio, we're still well over 2 times the regulatory requirement to be well-capitalized at 5%. So just
important to note that we still have a significant amount of capital to continue investing in growth, growing the
balance sheet, and growing our businesses. And with that being said, since the beginning of the fiscal year, our
client cash balances have increased over 15%, which is an amazing number if you think about it, we're six months
into our fiscal year. And most of that has come, as you mentioned, to the broker-dealer in the Client Interest
Program, the vast majority of which are used to fund short-term treasuries. We're talking 30-day, 60-day type
treasuries pursuant to the segregated asset SEC rules.
So these are the first cash balances that will be redeployed either on-balance sheet or off-balance sheet as
demand from third-party banks recover after the increase in short-term interest rates and just the kind of
dimension that impact to our Tier 1 leverage ratio. Before the pandemic, these balances were hovering right
around $2 billion. So at $15 billion of really overflow is what I would call this in the client accommodation. That's
eating into about 300 basis points of the Tier 1 leverage ratio. And frankly, when we set the 10% target a little less
than a year ago, we don't look at this impact on this portion of the balance sheet the same as we do other portions
of the balance sheet, because, again, they're invested in 30- or 60-day treasuries, which are obviously highly
liquid. So, it's really just geography in terms of putting this on the balance sheet here versus putting it with third-
party banks where it's not on the balance sheet and doesn't eat into Tier 1 leverage ratio, which we will do when
their demand resumes or funding our own bank, which we would earn a higher spread on, obviously, than we do
on 30-day treasuries. So hopefully, that answers your question there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. So, don't want to put words in your mouth, but it sounds like the 10% Tier 1 leverage minimum is not quite
the minimum in absolute terms. We should really think about where that balance sits and where that sort of
comes from and how that impacts capital ratio is a little bit more dynamically. Is that right?

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
Yeah. I mean, I think that's a good way of thinking about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Okay, great. And then, just piggybacking on the point you made around the building cash levels, obviously we've
seen that across the industry, but with rising rates, the conversations around cash sorting, obviously, picking up
pretty materially. In the last cycle, if my math is right, I think you guys have seen about a 15% to 20% decline in
sort of peak to trough cash balances across the franchise. Given the changes in the customer mix and how much
you've grown, is that still the right framework to think about how much could leave in this cycle understanding the
pace of rates is likely to be much faster this time around?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I think you're right. In the last cycle, it was around a 15% to 20% decline. But I mean, remember, we just in
the last six months increased balances by 15%. So, if that – if we see a decline over the next year or two as rates
rise and, really, the decline happens after the first 100 basis points, then it's not really that big of a deal,
considering we just got that in the last six months here and it's sitting in short-term treasuries. And remember, that
decline in cash balances will be more than offset by the increase in short-term interest rates based on our
assumptions.
And the other factor that you need to consider is when you do have a decline in cash like that due to cash sorting,
the value of that cash becomes more valuable. So, as an example, today, the spot yield of our balances with
third-party banks is right around 50 basis points, which is right around Fed funds target. Before the pandemic, we
were getting Fed funds target plus 10 or 15 basis points. So, the spread on not only those balances but also loans
in a more cash-tight environment, the cash becomes more valuable, and that offsets a portion of the impact from
declining cash balances in the system as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. If I could squeeze in one more. Busy morning, obviously, between a bunch of calls here. But TriState, so I
believe you initially targeted $3 billion of sort of funding replacement on their balance sheet once the deal closes.
Is that still the case? I think, in the first year, you're targeting, you said, about $3 billion. Why wouldn't you go a
little faster, given that their deposit beta, I think, is going to be a lot higher than yours?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, you asked about the cash sorting issue just in your prior question. So, we're going to look at – they
bring in diversified funding sources. They have very good depository clients, many of which are also clients on the
asset side. And they're going to continue running independently, of course. So, we're going to do what makes the
most sense for both them and us. We're not beholden to the assumptions we used and the due diligence and
valuation process nor are we going to make decisions to boost short-term results that may compromise long-term
results. So, we're going to, as we do with all of our decisions, make them based on what's best for our investors
over the long term.

I just want to reiterate TriState operating as an independent subsidiary has to take care of its clients' cash needs
and commitments, too. So, it's not just math, right. We just – they need – they'll have a lot of client balances to
manage. And the $3 billion was just a rough estimate of the excess where we could replace them without – they

Research. Go right ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hi. Good morning, Pauls. So, wanted to start off with just a question on TriState. The rate backdrop is clearly
much more constructive since the deal was first announced. And given the revenue upside is coming from less
compensable spread income, I was hoping you could provide some thoughts on the updated TSC accretion
expectations based on the current forward curve and how we should be thinking about where PPNR margins
could potentially settle out with higher rates in a fully integrated TSC deal as we think about your normalized
earnings power.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, I think there's a lot baked into that question, and I don't think it's – there's a lot that has changed since we
announced the acquisition in the 8% to 12% type accretion. But I don't think – maybe at the Analyst Investor Day,
we can get into more detail with all the different variables.
One thing I will say is that their loan growth since we announced the transaction, and they're a separate public
company. So, I also don't want to get too much into their own results or what the upside is to higher rates going
forward for their results until after we close the transaction. But I think I can say that the loan growth since they –
since we announced the transaction has been much stronger than we were projecting. Of course, we try to use
conservative projections, but they've had really – continued to have strong loan growth since announcing the
transaction. So that coupled with the higher increases in short-term rates that we were expecting and, again, vast
majority of their assets are floating rate assets certainly are nice tailwinds for us going forward.

Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
And, Paul, I mean, any insights you can share just in terms of how we should think about that terminal PPNR
margin. I think the big debate is you're going to be integrating this deal. The accretion tailwinds have certainly
been favorable over the last few quarters. You did note that loan growth has also come in better. The big debate
is how much of that revenue are you going to allow to fall to the bottom line versus get reinvested back in the
business. I just want to get some sense as to how we should be thinking about peak margin potential over the
next couple of years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, Steve. I would say that the peak margin potential is going to be driven more by the increase in short-term
interest rates and the impact that has on our $75-plus billion of client cash balances then the – any particular

transaction that we've closed or that is pending. So I would say – I would look at that, and as I said earlier on the
call, that impact in the first 100 basis points we're projecting to be somewhere in the $600 million range. So it's
obviously significant accretion to earnings for us in the first 100 basis points.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Very helpful. And then just if I could squeeze in one more just on the securities portfolio. I know historically you
guys have tended to favor more short-end versus long-end gearing. Certainly, given the pace of Fed tightening
that's anticipated, that's going to serve you pretty well here. But given the forward curve is actually starting to
bake in, a couple of Fed cuts a few years out, wanted to get some perspective on whether there's any appetite to
actually extend duration given some of the higher NBS proxies in particular, which could potentially protect you in
the event looking at a couple of years out that the Fed does, in fact, start easing and maybe we don't have – and
we don't have the soft landing that many of us were hoping for.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yes. So, at this point, we've – I think we've undertaken some criticism for being flexible. And flexibility just isn't
maximizing short-term earnings for us. It's maximizing the business model to be able to take advantages of
acquisitions, investments and, keeping flexible and difficult times, which, right now, is uncertain.
So, after waiting, we're certainly not ready to lock in short-term rates or longer-term rates while we're in the middle
of what we think will be an increasing interest rate cycle. But that doesn't mean at some point in the future where
we think with the asset liability management, we wouldn't lock in a portion. But that's not on the near-term goals
right now.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning, Paul and Paul. I wanted to get your thoughts a little bit more on the deposit beta and the 15%
assumption for this cycle. So first, if you can remind us where deposit rates peaked in the last cycle. And then, if I
think about the differences this time around, on a macro level, we're getting a much faster pace of rate hikes than
last time, inflation is higher, the Fed's going to shrink their balance sheet sooner. And for Raymond James
specifically, the bank is a lot larger, and you have the upcoming acquisition of TriState. So, with that in mind, what
are your thoughts on how the deposit beta dynamic will play out and what that will do to deposit rate cycle?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I mean, there are a lot of differences this cycle versus last rate cycle, so your guess is probably as good as
ours. We're going to be very competitive and try to be generous with our clients. The 15% kind of
assumption/guesstimate that we have for the first 100 basis points, which includes the first rate increase in March
where the deposit beta was obviously extremely low across the industry, assumes that there's a pick-up in deposit
beta with the subsequent increases.
So, in the last rate cycle, we peaked out at around 60 basis points on average for the cost of funds and the
sweep, and that's when Fed funds target topped out at about 2.5%. So, usually, the investable cash, going back
to the cash sorting topic gets invested in short-term alternatives like purchase money market funds, I think we
have the best purchase money market fund platform in the industry for our clients who are looking to optimize
their yield.
So, that's kind of how we're thinking about it in terms of bifurcating the cash in the account and how we pass on in
the sort of operational cash component of the accounts. But we're obviously going to look at the competitive
environment as rates rise and try to be fair and competitive with our clients.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I think if you look to that, all cycles are different, and things happen different. So, the first thing is you have to be
flexible and responsive. We've done a good job even planning out various scenarios and cycles what we do well
in advance. So, our best guess right now is it'll be like the last cycle, just faster. So, we may have to move
quicker, but we think the relative spreads and things will still be there. We certainly have a lot more cash. And
economically, even though when you lose balances, you still gain net interest income because of the rate
differential. So, it should be positive, at least through the next couple of raises. And then, longer term is whatever
longer term is, so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. I guess a follow-up to that is what the rate sensitivity, the $600 million will look like for the next 100 basis
points, right. Because presumably, we're going to get several rate hikes in short order. Presumably, by the time
we get to June, July, we'll be talking about the next 100 basis points. So, any thoughts on what that $ 600 million
should look like. Just based on your comments, I'm assuming we need to haircut that a little bit, but would love
your thoughts on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I think what most people are assuming is that the incremental benefits with incremental rate hikes are going
to decline significantly. Still be a benefit net-net, but decline relative to the first 100 basis points as the lag catches
up and the deposit betas increase. But again, if we're guessing on the first 100 basis points, then we're certainly
going to be guessing on the second 100 basis points. So, time will tell.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

material hits to AOCI this quarter?

Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
I would certainly. I don't think I would call it material. You saw that our equity – balance sheet equity was flat
during the quarter despite strong earnings net of dividends. So, I think the AOCI impact was somewhere around
$300 million for the quarter, and that's again a testament to our aversion to taking too much duration risk. We
keep that securities portfolio very short, and we're actually shortening it now. We're buying treasuries now with
sort of two-year lifes today just to position ourselves, as Paul said, to give us even more flexibility going forward,
given all the uncertainty around rates.

William Raymond Katz Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. Thank you very much for taking the questions this morning and your prepared commentary. Just coming
back to capital for a moment. So, Paul, if I hear you correctly, some of the sort of the pressure on the Tier 1
leverage ratio sequentially probably abates a little bit, just given how client cash will move around a little bit. And
you obviously get the favorable impact from higher rates and notwithstanding a flat investment banking outlook
and the deal with TSC. You mentioned maybe some caution around buyback, sort of curious why that would be
the case at this point in time, given what should be pretty fat capital ratios net of everything.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. The only cautionary isn't backing out of our plan to buy back the TSC purchase price. It's just we're in a
very uncertain economic environment. And if things tanked, we'd have to look at if the market really tanked and no
telling what happens or if the geopolitical thing really heightens and becomes global, we'll be more cautious and
more on pace. Now, if the price if that happen and stock prices were affected, we'll probably still be able to
accomplish it. But we're just – we always look at the macro outlook. Number one for us is safety and flexibility,
and secondary is execution. So it was nothing more than a broad cautionary in a world that anything can go right
now, in the worst case, as we take a look at it. But this capital and liquidity stay number one, but we still plan to
execute that buyback, all things being...

And maybe the one thing I would add to that is whether we buy back that stock in one or two quarters following
our closing or three to four quarters following closing, it seems like a long time in the models, but for us, it's a blip.
We make decisions for the next three to five years, not for the next three to five quarters. And the timing of the
buybacks really doesn't impact results all that much a year to two years out. So if it makes more sense, given all
the factors that Paul just described, to wait a couple of quarters, then we'll wait a couple of quarters. We're going
to err on the side of caution just as we always do.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Raymond Katz Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Okay. Thank you. And then maybe just a two-part unrelated question. I apologize for nesting it this way. But on
the P&L, communications had a pretty big sequential step up. And I think business development similarly had a
pretty flat against – relative to sort of good organic growth. Any geography changes here? Any impact from
Charles Stanley that you can help us maybe unpack a little bit?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah, you nailed it. It's really a lot of the impact from Charles Stanley. They had around $45 million of total
expenses reflected in the quarter since they closed. And a portion – a big portion of that hit the communication
information processing line. So I think that's what you're really seeing there is just the impact from the two months
of Charles Stanley acquisition and some of those line items.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Raymond Katz Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Got you. And then just the related question is, I sort of appreciate we're all trying to get at the pre-tax margin
discussion. But as you look at your core business today, I think one of the themes you've talked about is you've
been spending pretty regularly now over the last couple of years to sort of build the scale and the opportunity set.
Is there anything in the core businesses that you've been underinvesting in? And I'd be curious, would you be
willing to change the payout grid on the Private Client side to accelerate growth even more, or a sort of a 75%
blended payout is a reasonable thought process from here? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Well, I think we've spent well on our infrastructure and it's very leverageable. The systems that we've put in and
all of the back office have been a significant investment. We have increased our technology run rate, again, this
year. So, we'll continue to invest in technology as we move all of our systems forward. And the next big
investment is really around our client apps because we've felt that we've gotten more work to do but a leading –
the leading wealth planning desktop. So now we're putting that same technology to the client app so the advisor
and client have that same intimacy.
But outside of that, no, I think we're well-invested. We're not really looking at anything. And we've invested now. I
mean, people asked if we're ever going to acquire anything and we've got three in the hopper, one closed, and
two hopefully to close soon. So, we've got a lot going on and we think we've been investing well across the firm
and believe in the long-term growth will be great with these acquisitions. They weren't focused on short-term
growth, although once integrated I think they'll do very well.

Operator: We'll now proceed to our next question on the line from Kyle Voigt from KBW. Go right ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Maybe just getting some clarity on the PCG asset management revenues and the guidance of
that being likely down 3% or so in fiscal 3Q. I guess we're seeing those fee-based assets essentially flat over the
past two quarters, and I understand that's really due to adding the Charles Stanley assets. So, organically, they're
down 3%. I guess the question is, I guess, where are those Charles Stanley revenues coming through in that
segment then. Because given what you said, it would imply that none of those revenue is really coming through
that asset management line.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I think it's just a function of timing, Kyle. So, we did have those revenues coming through those lines for just
over two months of the quarter. But the assets weren't really reflected until the end of the quarter. So, all we're
saying is that despite the assets appearing – being flat sequentially, those revenues will decline somewhere
around 3% starting next quarter because we already have accounting for those revenues, at least two months of it
so far this quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Thanks. And then just given how yields trended through the first or through the calendar first quarter, just
wondering if you had any details regarding how has the AFS portfolio trended in the quarter. So, maybe anything
on end-of-period AFS balances would be helpful. And, I guess, do you view the securities reinvestment rates right
now as attractive enough to really start moving some of those CIP deposits into the bank to ramp up growth in
that securities portfolio more meaningfully?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
We're doing that modestly. I mean, the – we've – shortening the duration with treasuries to two years from the
three to four years that we were buying in the agency mortgage back. And the incremental spread on what we're
buying versus what's running off from the legacy portfolio is just north of 1%. So, we think it's somewhat attractive.
I mean, that comes with duration, and we want to stay flexible, as Paul pointed out before. So, we're not going to
do that in a dramatic way. But we do have a lot of cash and CIP that is invested in very short-term treasuries in
the 30- to 60-day treasuries. And so to the extent that we can deploy some of that incrementally into the bank to
earn a higher yield and sort of wait until this demand from third-party banks recover, then we think that that would
16


Raymond James Financial, Inc.
(RJF) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
be a good trade-off. But it's not going to be too significant, I would say, in terms of growth of the securities
portfolio. But we do expect ongoing growth between now and the end of the fiscal year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kyle Voigt Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. And then just a follow-up question on that one is that CIP is now setting out $17 billion in balances. Is there
a certain percentage of those balances we should think about you wanting to migrate and deploy in the bank
versus moving off balance sheet to free up capital? Given what you just said, is it fair to think about a majority of
those, you really want to move off-balance sheet into the third-party sweep?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I guess we don't have any sort of predetermined objectives in terms of where it goes. We think that there's
– we know that about $15 billion of those balances are $13 billion today because they have declined by a couple
of billion so far in April due to fee billings and tax payments is sort of what we consider our overflow balances that
would prefer FDIC insurance when capacity recovers for that with third-party banks and/or when Raymond James
Bank needs that capacity as well. So, over time, we would expect somewhere around $10 billion or north of $10
billion of that to get redeployed from CIP to third-party banks, Raymond James Bank or redeployed into higher
yielding alternatives for clients.

Apologies. I hopped on a minute late, and I know there's been a lot of questions around your pre-tax margin and
expenses. I don't think you hit this yet. I'm just trying to think about just the comp ratio, and I appreciate we're
going to hit a lot more details on May 25. But when we look back a couple of years ago, comp ratio 65%, 66%
when rates were more, call it, normalized, without making a call on Capital Markets and kind of considering a few
17


Raymond James Financial, Inc.
(RJF) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
of the small acquisitions you've done, I just want to think about maybe what's structurally different today. A lot of
conversation in the market around expense inflation and higher base salaries and base overall compensation.
So, is that meaningful to change kind of the narrative of the comp ratio or the mix being so different that it
changes kind of the way we should be thinking about comp going forward in the structure relative to prior period
of kind of more normalized rate environment?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So, this quarter's comp ratio wasn't a surprise to us given Capital Markets were down and given that a lot of
our FICO and other stuff hits this quarter, which has always been elevated. So, we felt that was certainly in line.
And, certainly, we've had a rate rise, but it really didn't come through the quarter. It was at the end of the quarter.
So, as rates go up, those comp ratios will go down because they're non-compensable. They'll be pretty
significant.
And, again, Capital Markets, if it recovers from the pace it is, it'll drive it down also. So, we're looking – we feel
pretty good about where it's headed and the interest rate environment. And we do see pressure. Our recruiting
has actually been pretty good. There is market pressure. So, my guess, it'll be a slight headwind for everyone, but
we don't see it being a significant number. But we're looking at that and looking at the adjustments and sensitive
to people that aren't in the top part of their payouts, making sure they're compensated so that they can kind of
survive a high-inflationary environment. But – so that would be on the other side somewhat, but it's going to be
well outpaced by, I think, interest spreads and a more normalized return to Capital Markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Right. Okay. Thanks, Paul. And then just one, thinking about kind of the UK opportunity, obviously, with Charles
Stanley now closed, I appreciate it's still very small for Raymond James. But can you remind us, Paul, how you're
thinking about the addressable market in the UK for the firm and whether you're having dialogue with other firms
there? I know you were talking to Charles Stanley for some time and knew them well. So, are there more
opportunities like that? How should we think about the expansion in the UK organic versus inorganic? And, really,
I guess the thought is, does Charles Stanley now having that kind of deal, not necessarily behind you but
completed, does that set you up for more deals in the region?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
So strategically, it's a very fragmented market. With Charles Stanley, I think it puts us close to the top 10 just
outside. And so we think there's a lot of opportunity. Charles Stanley really has high-quality people, high-quality
back-office and – but they've been slower on growth mainly because they've been more capital constrained.
We've had a much smaller but a much quicker growing, probably an industry-leading growth in terms of inorganic
recruiting in the UK market. So, we hope the combination that we can – between their support, our capital, and
our ability to recruit and grow hopefully to combine the best of all those worlds.
Now, it's going to take a while to integrate that, right. I mean, we're close, but we've got to – we know we have a
year-long project just to look at systems integration, best-of-class, making sure that we – as always, our focus is,
first, retention. We've had a – we don't want to mess up our consecutive series of integrations where we've kept
the people. And part of that is we're very, very thoughtful on how we put things together. We don't slam them
together. We haven't assumed anybody or any system was going to come out on top. And they're doing both –
18


Raymond James Financial, Inc.
(RJF) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
teams on both sides, I think, a great job of looking at that, and then we will integrate the system. So, it'll take a
while to gear that up.
But we think both – so, we're not going to look at any acquisitions during that integration period. But after it's
integrated up and running, and we get it running as we'd like to, there's – I think there are opportunities in that
market, and you can see that RBC entered the market with an acquisition. So, I think others see that opportunity,
too, and – but it's going to take a little while to integrate it is, I guess, the bottom line. But we're very optimistic and
really like the people.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Devin Ryan Q
Analyst, JMP Securities LLC
Yeah. Okay. That's great. One last one here just on the Capital Markets side of business or, I guess, the
institutional side. The M&A pipelines are strong, as I heard. You guys have a pretty diverse focus there, which
maybe insulates more from volatility in other parts of the market.
I guess, what are you guys seeing in terms of closure rates? How much are deals getting pushed out, and then
new deals filling back in into the pipeline? Just trying to think about kind of the push and pull in that business. I
appreciate that it can change to the extent markets remain volatile or vice versa. But just the comfort in kind of
the, I don't know, the next 12 months for the M&A advisory business coming off of, obviously, a great prior 12
months.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So comfort is a hard word to use in this environment right now. We think at this run rate, even in this
environment, we can continue. But certainly, there's a lot of upside. What we're seeing is most deals in pause, not
canceled, in the pipeline. We see new deals coming in and enter the pipeline. So I would call strong, maybe it's
more robust and we've had a very good pipeline. And the problem is it's been paused. So part of that is a little bit
market and market valuations certainly on the underwriting side, but the M&A side a little bit.
And then the uncertainties had people sit back and wait and making sure that with the political uncertainty globally
that that's not really going to hurt the market. So I would say right now it's paused deals that are still in the
pipeline. Now, if there's – if the geopolitical thing heats up, you may – some of those pause may turn to cancel or
if the market really tanks. But the market stays steady and people get more comfortable geopolitically, I think
there's a lot of upside too. So it's just hard to call because those are the two impacts.

Yeah. I think that is given the mix of our assets, 1.2% seems reasonable. That was roughly the percent that we
saw in the provision this quarter. But, again, we're using CECL models. So, if macroeconomic...

...conditions deteriorate, you could see provision increase and vice versa if macroeconomic conditions improve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q

Was there any – would CECL contribute in any way to this or was it just all growth?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Most of it was growth related. As you saw, we had really strong growth at the bank this quarter.

James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Global Securities
Right. And can you remind us what your betas were in the second 100 basis points? I appreciate there's – you
can't predict it, but maybe in the last cycle what the betas were in the second 100 basis points?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul Shoukry A
Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. If my memory serves me correctly, I think we're closer as an industry to the 50% range for the last couple of
increases as we got from 200 to 250 basis points on the Fed funds target. That's sort of what I recall off the top of
my head.

Q2 2022 Earnings Call 28-Apr-2022
Operator: Thank you very much. And we'll proceed with our final question for today from the line of Chris Allen
with Compass Point. Go right ahead.

Chris Allen Q
Analyst, Compass Point Research & Trading LLC
Morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I think most of it has been covered. I guess I want to quickly just
follow up on the SumRidge Partners deal. The press release makes it sound like an electronic marker maker – I'm
sorry, market maker on electronic trading platforms. But looking at their website, it seems a bit more potentially
advisor-facing. So, maybe give us some color there and whether this deal is more driven by the need for
technology improvements on the fixed income trading side or whether there's other synergy opportunities moving
forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Paul C. Reilly A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I think it's a – there's a lot of pieces to it first culturally and risk management-wise, as we've been talking to
them for quite some time. We think they're a great fit. And what it adds strategically for us is the weakest part of
our Fixed Income platform has been the corporate area, we're just – versus our competitors we're a lot smaller in
the corporate bond area. So, they bring really great expertise there.
Secondly, they do have trader-assisted technology where they're able to sort and execute trades with a lot of
analytics. And we believe that that system can be migrated to other parts of our business too, to help tech-enable
the trading, which is important. Their focus has really been on institutional clients, although they do have an app
with some advisory-facing, but it's relatively small. But we really like the app, so we think it may be something we
can convert to our – to the advisory side of our business.
So, there's lots of pieces we really like. We really like the people, the risk management. And the technology, we
think, can be really spread to lots of part of our Fixed Income business.

Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Raymond James Financial, Inc.
Well, appreciate everyone coming on today. I know it's a crowded day. I think that given our discipline that we're
really into a market with rising rates that we'll do really well. We have plenty of capital to deploy even with our
three acquisitions. And we'll stay true as we always have to our guiding conservative principles. But I think given –
I think we're still in good shape to make all the commitments unless something weird happens in the market. But if
it does, again, with all of our capacity and flexibility, I think relatively we'll be in good shape.
So, appreciate you joining us and we'll talk to you next quarter.
