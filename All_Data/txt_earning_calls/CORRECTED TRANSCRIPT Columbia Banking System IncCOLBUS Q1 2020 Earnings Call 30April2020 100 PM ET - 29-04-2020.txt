President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Tamra. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call as we review our first
quarter results, which we released before the market opened this morning. The earnings release is also available
at columbiabank.com.
I want to begin the call today by thanking our 2,200 bankers who despite tremendous disruption to their
professional and personal lives have joined together to support each other and serve our customers, communities
and shareholders as the COVID-19 pandemic has evolved. [indiscernible] (01:18) region entered into the
pandemic earlier than other parts of the US with the first coronavirus death reported on February 29. We
developed a detailed pandemic plan many years ago and most recently tested it through a Bank-wide exercise in
December of 2018.
The phased plan and we began to execute against the first phase in early January. Since then, we've continued to
follow our plan, proactively planning for additional escalation at pre-determined trigger points. Early on, our

bankers were in direct communication with our clients to understand their individual challenges and work through
options to provide relief for their businesses and families.
We're a community bank at heart and I believe that our bankers' empathy, compassion and support has and will
continue to be our most valuable currency. Columbia Bank is well positioned to handle the impact of COVID-19
and its ensuing market disruptions. This is different from the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009 and that it's not a
financial crisis, but a public health crisis with serious economic ramifications that are still evolving. The strength of
our balance sheet, credit profile, liquidity and capital position, along with our proactive interest rate risk strategies
and sensible expense management will serve us well as we weather the economic consequences of COVID-19.
We started off the year with tremendous momentum and you can see the impact throughout our financial
statement line items. EPS declined by $0.44 on a linked quarter basis, due to the related credit loss provision
expense of $41.5 million. On a pre-provision basis, this was the fifth best quarter in our history in what is typically
our seasonally weakest quarter. While net income and EPS were significantly impacted by the CECL provision
expense, our bankers remained outwardly focused and produced strong loan and deposit growth during the
quarter, while reducing non-interest expenses. Absent the impact of COVID-19, it would have been an
outstanding quarter.
On the call with me today are Eric Eid, who until this past Monday was our Interim Chief Financial Officer; Chris
Merrywell, our Chief Operating Officer; and Andy McDonald, our Chief Credit Officer. Following in our prepared
remarks, we'll be happy to answer your questions. Let me remind you that we may make forward-looking
statements during the call. For further information on forward-looking comments, please refer to either our
earnings release or website or SEC filings.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Eric.

Executive VP, Chief Digital & Technology Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Clint. First quarter earnings of $14.6 million and earnings per share of $0.20 included a CECL day 2
provision for credit losses of $41.5 million. After factoring out the significant provision expense, quarterly pre-tax
earnings were best first quarter on record. Pre-tax pre-provision income was $59.4 million and was $1.3 million
higher than the first quarter of 2019. Net interest income for the first quarter was $122.4 million, a decrease of
$2.4 million on a linked-quarter basis and an increase of $1.4 million from first quarter 2019.
The linked-quarter decline in net interest income was due to lower loan income from the reduction in the interest
rate environment, one day less of earnings, and an increase in interest paid on FHLB advances. This was partially
offset by $1.9 million of interest income and discount accretion related to the early pay off of three securities. The
increase in short-term funding cost was mostly due to a decline in average deposits, although period end deposits
increased during the quarter.
The operating NIM of 4.02% was down 7 basis points on a linked-quarter basis, primarily due to lower loan yields.
Our cost to deposits continue to be industry-leading at 14 basis points, down 7 basis points on a linked-quarter
basis. Total deposits ended the quarter at $10.8 billion, up $128 million from year-end primarily due to an increase
of $105 million of public funds. Our typical seasonal pattern is for little to no deposit growth in the first quarter.
At March 31, 49% of our loan portfolio was fixed, 16% was at floors with another $500 million or 6% protected by
our interest rate color. The result of 71% of our loan portfolio was protected from further rate declines. Our
liquidity position continues to provide us balance sheet capacity to meet funding needs. Overall, we have access

to $4.5 billion of liquidity, primarily through our $3.5 billion investment portfolio, of which $3 billion are investment
grade, readily marketable and not pledged on any borrowing base. Additionally, we have $1.5 billion unused
borrowing capacity with Federal Home Loan Bank and correspondent banks.
Non-interest income of $21.2 million was down $600,000 from prior quarter, principally due to decrease in deposit
account and other fees, partially offset by an increase in loan fees. Compared to first quarter 2019, non-interest
income was down $489,000, primarily due to lower deposit account fees and net securities gains, offset by higher
loan fees. Non-interest expense was $84.3 million in the first quarter, which was a decrease of $2.7 million on a
linked-quarter basis. On a year-over-year basis, non-interest expense was actually down $429,000.
We anticipate our expense run rate to continue in the mid-80s, as we handle expenses associated with COVID-19
and continue to invest in our future. Our core non-interest expense ratio was 2.41% for the quarter, down from
2.53% in the fourth quarter. Our expense ratio compares favorably to the 2.60% reported in the first quarter of
2019. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.1%, which compares to 20.5% on a linked quarter basis and
19% for first quarter 2019.
At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris.

Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thank you, Eric, and good morning, everyone. To echo Clint's opening comments, we have shifted the way that
we work to serve the immediate and critical needs of our clients and communities, while at the same time,
keeping our employees, clients and communities safe. Our production and back-office teams have been
outstanding, as they worked around the clock to assist clients with payment [indiscernible] (08:04) and another
relief programs, including the SBA Paycheck Protection Program. The teams had to pivot very quickly, because
the regulations have evolved and have been successful in guiding our clients to the process. As a result, we
believe that Columbia is positioned to participate in the Paycheck Protection Program at levels that are far and
excess of our relative market share.
First quarter saw solid loan and deposit growth in spite of the economic shutdown. Deposit rose by $128 million
during the quarter and the mix remained at 59% business and 41% consumer. The increase was predominantly in
public firms and on the retail side. We experienced our typical deposit seasonality as retail clients withdrew funds,
pay down credit and other expenses and then build some backup towards the end of the quarter.
Our cost of deposits of 14 basis points continued to be lower than our peers, reflecting the strength of our non-
interest bearing deposit base. On the interest bearing side, we immediately moved to reduce rates after the 150
basis point bad interest rate dropped in March. And deposit rates are back at levels last seen in 2017. We
continue believe that our relationship-based approach is a key differentiator and our clients rely on this as much
as on the any deposit interest rate available in the market.
Loan balances grew by $119 million, on an annualized increase of 9%, new loan production was $341 million and
increased line utilization was $120 million during the quarter. In line with the industry's first quarters increase in
line utilization, was predominantly in the C&I revolving lines increasing from 49% at year-end 2019 to 51.6% at
the end of the first quarter. New loan production was mostly centered in CRE 39% or $128 million and C&I 38% or
$126 million, with approximately one-third in the real estate rental leasing sector, followed by the construction,
healthcare, hospitality and agricultural sectors. This was similar to the first quarter of 2019, where production was
centered in the same sectors as well as public administration.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
It's worth noting that agriculture is now presented separately in our financial statements, previously it was a
component of C&I loans. Agriculture new production for the quarter was $32 million. Term loans comprised 78%
of the production, whereas lines were 22% of the total. The quarterly production mix was 68% fixed, 28% floating,
and 4% variable. The overall portfolio mix is now at 49% fixed, 34% floating and 17% variable.
New loan production throughout the quarter was booked at an average tax adjusted coupon rate of 4.32%, which
is lower than the overall portfolio rate of 4.44% as of quarter-end. The overall portfolio rate declined 25 basis
points during the quarter with C&I down 39 basis points and CRE down 11 basis points. We are continuing to
invest in the business. As we have said in prior calls, we expect improvements in our peer-to-peer and bank-to-
bank money transfer capabilities, online deposit account opening and back office to small business lending
capabilities to go online later this year or in early 2021.
Now, I will turn the call over to Andy to review our credit performance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew L. McDonald
Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Thanks, Chris. The increase in provision under CECL of $41.5 million is primarily due to a deteriorating economic
forecast resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. We use IHS Markit for our economic forecasts and when
compared to the estimate at the beginning of the year, while you can imagine it has changed quite a bit.
In general, our forecast anticipates an annualized reduction in gross domestic product in the second quarter
approaching 28% to 30%, relatively flat performance after that with the following quarter beginning to see a
rebound. Therefore, the change in the forecast accounted for about $34 million of our provision and the rest was
due to negative migration that occurred in the portfolio. NPAs clicked up a bit to 34 basis points. However, this
was not related to COVID-19 impacts. The increase was in non-accrual loans, represented by borrowers who had
been under stress well before COVID-19 issues and related impacts came to fruition.
Past due loans for the quarter were 23 basis points and net charge-offs annualized were also 23 basis points for
the quarter. Therefore, your standard credit metrics for the quarter were very acceptable. On the risk rating side,
loans rated watch or below increased to approximately $450 million during the quarter. We saw watch loans
increase $126 million, going from $184 million to $310 million. Special Mention loans increased $265 million to
$317 million and Substandard loans saw an increase of $65 million and are now around $304 million in total.
These changes increased our watch and below risk ratings from 5.4% to 10.4% of total loans. Many of these
downgrades occurred in portfolios that we believe will be quickly impacted by COVID-19 measures. Clearly, these
are unprecedented times. The rapidly changing environment we are operating in today has dramatically changed
the Bank's assessment of credit risk. As with the great recession, we believe it is in the best interest of all of our
stakeholders for us to get out in front of this by focusing on the industries we believe will be some of the first to
exit at stress.
As such, it is only prudent to acknowledge these risks and we believe that provision taken in the quarter and the
assessment of risk ratings undertaken prior to quarter end demonstrate or resolve in doing so. We have also
granted 2,600 requests for payment deferrals, amounting to about $1.2 billion in total loans through April 24. We
believe these deferrals are in the best interest of our stakeholders, as we try to work our way through this
pandemic. Most of the deferrals, about 1,400 or roughly $580 million were granted to clients in our dental
portfolio; roughly $770 million were for small businesses, which accounted for another $300 million from loan
deferrals.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
With that, I would now like to give you some color on the portfolios we believe will be some of the first to be
impacted by the pandemic. For Columbia, that includes hotels, retail, restaurants, aviation and of course, our
dental and healthcare portfolios; in aggregate, these industries account for about $2.2 billion in loans, or roughly
25% of our portfolio.
The largest portfolio impacted by COVID-19 is our dental portfolio. I'm sure most of you are aware [indiscernible]
(16:30) directed dental practices to cease operation with the exception of emergency type procedures. So,
effectively, dental offices are closed and are not expected to reopen until sometime in May. As of March 31, we
had $812 million in dental-related loans, representing approximately 2,100 notes for an average note size of
382,000. Therefore, it's a very granular portfolio.
As I said, today, we have processed payment deferrals for approximately two-thirds of this portfolio. As such,
those will not be required to resume making payments until August of this year. We believe the impact on this
portfolio is truly transitory and by working with these clients, we will be able to minimize the impact of COVID-19
on their business, as well as the Bank's balance sheet. We anticipate a large number of these clients will also
participate in the Paycheck Protection Program, which will assist them with working capital needs as they reopen
their businesses.
Before I move on, I'd like to share a few credit metrics starting with portfolio. As of March 31, approximately 95%
of the portfolio was [indiscernible] (17:57). Past dues were minimal at 17 basis points. I would also highlight that
deferrals did not affect this number, as deferrals are only granted to customers in good [indiscernible] (18:11), so
in another way, they made their March payment. We also had approximately $4 million in non-accrual dental
loans, however, these loans were already non-accruals, prior to the COVID-19 outbreak.
So, excluding the dental portfolio, we have another $1.4 billion or 16% of our portfolio to discuss. The next largest
segment, which we have identified is having a high risk relative to the economic disruption caused by COVID-19
is our retail portfolio. We have approximately $498 million in retail related exposure, split between commercial real
estate and commercial business loan. This represents about 5.6% of our loan portfolio.
The largest part of our retail exposure is comprised of commercial real estate loans with approximately $416
million total. It's evenly split -well, I'm really struggling here – between Washington and Oregon as you would
expect centered in the Portland and Seattle MSAs. The average loan size is $344,000. The largest component is
building materials and garden-centered types of businesses, representing about 23%. Next is, auto vehicle and
parts dealers at around 20%, followed by food and beverage stores at 20% as well. Using that origination values,
the average loan to value for the portfolio was 54% with 85% of the portfolio having a loan to value less than 65%
based on origination.
We have stress tested this portfolio for an equivalent decline in value as seen in the Great Recession. The
average loan to value rises to 66% with about 50% of the properties having a loan to value less than 65%. On a
stressed basis, 92% of the properties have a loan to value of less than 85%. For the entire retail portfolio, 85% is
Pass, 6% is Loss, 6% is Special Mention and 3% Substandard. We've also seen minimal reclass for repayment
deferrals to-date in this portfolio.
Hotels is the next area I would like to address. We have $326 million in hotel loan, representing about 3.6% of our
loan portfolio. About 38% is in major markets, which would include the Portland and Seattle MSA. However, we
also have about 17% of the portfolio or $52 million of exposure out on the Oregon coast.

To give you an idea of the type of hotels we finance, most have one of the following flag, Holiday Inn, Best
Western, Marriott and Radisson. These would be good examples of the types of flags that properties we financed
out. In total, flagged properties comprised 84% of the portfolio. The average loan size is $1.8 million. Today, we
have granted 44 deferral requests for about $110 million. Similar to the retail commercial real estate loans, we did
some stress testing on this portfolio as well.
The average loan-to-value for the portfolio based on originated appraised value is 52% with 80% of the portfolio
having a loan-to-value less than 65%. On a stressed basis, about 48% of the portfolio has a loan-to-value less
than 65% with 87% having a loan-to-value less than 85%. Non-dental healthcare is about $245 million in total,
approximately $85 million is veterinary and another $122 million are physician practices of varying kinds and we
also have $38 million of other healthcare providers, such as chiropractors, physical therapists and counseling
services. The average loan size is $335,000. Today, 98% of the portfolio has been upgraded with 1% on watch
and 1% rated Substandard. We have granted a 124 deferral requests for about $41 million in total in this
segment. Similar to the dental space, we see this sector rebounding when the economy opens up as folks are
once again able to see the orthopedists, dermatologists, optometrist and so on.
Okay. Restaurants and food services, we have approximately $183 million in this portfolio, with an average loan
size of $299,000. Today, 84% is Pass rated, 12% watch and the balance is Substandard. We have granted 101
deferrals for about $44 million in this portfolio. Today, 84% of Pass rated, 12% of loss and 4% is substandard.
The average credit had a debt service coverage of 1.56% with a loan to value of 46%. On a stressed case
scenario, loan to value rises to 56%.
The last portfolio I'm going to discuss is our aviation portfolio, which comprise of both direct exposure to domestic
airline carriers as well as entities that leads airplanes to airline carriers. In total, the portfolio is about $150 million,
with about $100 million being direct exposure to US domestic airline and the remaining $50 million exposure to
lessors of airplanes.
Today, essentially the entire portfolio is rated Special Mention with the exception of one credit rated Substandard.
As you know during the week of April 13, the domestic airline carriers began entering into formal agreements with
the US Treasury regarding the Receipt of Funds giving out with CARES Act. We believe this government funding
will help them recover from COVID-19 impacts, along with the billions of dollars of capital raised in the past few
weeks by many industry participants.
As for the lessor portfolio, 49% of the exposure is in Asia; 23% in Europe; and 9% in North America. The rest is in
South America and the Middle East. The majority of the portfolio consists of narrowbody aircraft with an average
age of 6.5 years. We view these younger, more fuel efficient aircrafts to be more in demand post the pandemic.
Based on origination values, our average loan to value for the lessor portfolio was 74%. However, based on what
we believe today's values are, the loan to value is closer to 83%.
Okay. I'll now turn it back to Clint.

Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
First question on the margin, before I get to that, the percent of floors I wanted to – I went through pretty quick,
but I think you said 71% of the portfolio was protected from rate moves, which is 49% fixed loans. But could you
walk through the percent of loans with floors and those that are at floors?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric Eid A
Executive VP, Chief Digital & Technology Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Let me pull it up here. So, we have 49% of fixed. We have 16% are at the floors and then we have the
notional color – $500 million notional color that offset 6% of our one month LIBOR. So, when you add all of that
up, that's how you have come up with the 71%.

Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Yeah. So looking – taking a step back on margin, I guess the biggest risk that you all see is, that loan yields,
security yields or sort of lack of ability to lower deposits, given the already pretty low deposit level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric Eid A
Executive VP, Chief Digital & Technology Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Probably, maybe all of those to some extent. I think in the short run, with the PPP program, we're going to
probably actually see yields increase over the next couple of quarters as loans are forgiven and we take that
deferred fee income into spread. Longer run, obviously, for the loans that we carry on our balance sheet, that's
going to have an impact on our spread. Margins are going to continue to be under pressure. Forecasting right
now is a little bit of a challenge. We're seeing dislocation between LIBOR and fed funds. And so, we're getting our
arms around that. But I think we're going to see continued pressure on the NIM for sure.
And Clint, do you want to add anything?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well, I think just looking at it as a slightly different way might help. So, between the fixed part of the portfolio,
roughly $1.5 billion of floating rate loans that are at the floor already. And then when we think about loans that
won't reprice within the next year, there's about $6.5 billion of $8.9 billion in the portfolio, that's not going to face
that repricing pressure. I think, Eric mentioned, the difficulty with NIM – and for modeling purposes, it is a bunch of
us have just originated loans with a 1% coupon.
But looking at our core business dynamics, you have a significant part of the loan book, it's not going to reprice,
part of our interest rate risk strategies that we put in place was purchasing securities, the advance through much
of last year that perform well in a down rate environment. So, I don't think that you're going to see us necessarily
aggressively reinvesting into the securities book at this time. We'll be opportunistic about that.
So, I think that gives us some defense to asset mix, that's the big unknown. We don't know when the economy
reopens, how quickly things return to normal. We had a tremendous amount of momentum through January and
February in terms of our organic growth and we saw some asset mix shift on the balance sheet, shifting a little
more towards loan-to-deposits, as the loan-to-deposit ratio picked up. So, those are kind of all the factors that
we're taking into account as we think about looking forward. And as Chris mentioned, our deposit fund, cost of
deposits are near to historic lows, but we still have some fine tuning that we can do in that space as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D. A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. And Clint, just another question on the capital side, in terms of – you had a high payout ratio going in. That
included the special safe to say that you would maybe table the special and maybe buybacks, but – and a focus
on maintaining the regular, any thoughts on the capital there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. We repurchased, I guess right around 731,000 shares during the quarter under our 10b5-1 plan. And
wound that down in late March, when we hit the $20 million that we have allocated for that. We don't have any
intentions right now of doing buybacks and for the foreseeable future.

In terms of the special dividend, that's always been a tool that we've used to manage our capital ratios down. We
still have a pretty healthy TCE ratio of 10.7. But I think there's so much uncertainty out there that our primary
focus is maintaining the regular dividend and then I think in that we'd be content to let those capital ratios drift
upward.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Good morning, Gordon.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gordon McGuire Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
So, Clint, you'd mentioned January/February production being pretty record levels. I was wondering if you could
provide, how those trended month-by-month, I guess, how big was the drop off in March? And what does the
pipeline look like heading into the next quarter and I guess just your overall outlook for the rest of this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Merrywell A
Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Gordon, this is Chris. And I can tell you the drop off was pretty significant. As we moved into the phase have been
starting to be shut down and businesses being closed, we tabled – Andy had a pretty extensive review of the
dental portfolio, so he said as an example is, we have requests that we put on hold [indiscernible] (35:28) done
this standpoint of businesses being closed and things of that nature. So, I can get the actual figure month-by-
month, but it was pretty significant for the last month. We were on phase two to set a new first quarter record.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gordon McGuire Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. So, the pipeline is pretty muted. I'd assume the outlook is probably more flattish from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Merrywell A
Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
The pipeline, if we still have a good pipeline, there are some uncertainty around what's going to happen in the
economy and people reopen. There's some pent up demand for things, we'll see if those materialize. But that's
going to depend on reopening, how quick that happens and how quickly businesses are back to earning revenue,
where you probably – you're probably directionally correct there, it's certainly going to be more difficult.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gordon McGuire Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And Chris, you discussed PPP a little bit in your prepared remarks, but I'm not sure if I caught total
balances, do you have that? And just how are you guys thinking about funding those balances? So, I guess with
securities not really being reinvested, can you fund a lot of that with deposits, or are you going to look to outside
sources?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Merrywell A
Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
We have the ability to fund. We will look at all available options to include the ability to align, to put those to the
federal government as one of the options as far as discussing totals for in the second quarter and we will provide
guidance on that and I'll prepare to discuss the totals. But I will tell you that the team has been hard at work and
lots of long hours, night stays, showing up at 9 PM to hit 12 PM East Coast Time re-opening, so things of that
nature. And as we said, we feel that we'll do more than our aggregate share, based on our size. And I would tell
you that the demand outstripped our expectations.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
Gordon McGuire Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. I guess, Andy, your quote in release, talking about negative credit migration going into a deep dive on the
impacted industries. I guess that the deep dive was probably warranted by COVID-19. But I'm wondering how
much of the negative migration that you referenced is specific to COVID-19 issues or maybe underlying issues
that you might have seen, but were identified as a result of the deep dive you took, or are there any correlated
beyond just general COVID-19 issues that you saw?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew L. McDonald A
Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
The vast majority of the downgrades were as a result of, I guess, our dive into specific portfolios. So, you look at
airlines at $150 million that was all past rated, they've all moved to Special Mention, that's all COVID-19 related.
They're quite a bit – the downgrades were in our hotel and retail areas and that's pretty much COVID-19 related.
Were there credits in there that probably have underlying weaknesses? Sure. I mean, I can argue against that,
but I would say that because of our focus on those portfolios, those downgrades. So, I do believe that's
predominantly COVID-19 related.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gordon McGuire Q

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
Andrew L. McDonald A
Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I think the area that has been a struggle for us now a couple of years has been the agricultural portfolio.
And of course, I'm sure you're all aware of commodity prices. Certainly, the great news reports coming out of the
Midwest that farmers trying to [indiscernible] (40:11) the ground and dairies going up on to the ground. And so, we
are concerned about the Ag portfolio. We're going to have to see how that plays out.
Most of the truck came through the 2019 cycle, okay. Some still have some product to offload. But for the most
part, it's really going to be a function of what we did in production in 2020 and then do we see any kind of a
rebound in commodity prices by the time we bring the 2020 crop to market. Absent that, the one portfolio that's
not going to have the ability to enjoy such a calendar or timeframe was our cattle book, which is about $150
million in exposure and we are also watching that very closely.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Good. That helps. And then, the dental deferrals I think I caught what you were saying, but it sounds like
you're – most of these loans would come off their deferrals in August, is that – did I catch that right in your
prepared comments?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew L. McDonald A
Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Correct. So, our standard deferral programs were four months and that was on purpose to take us into the latter
part, if you will, or at least the middle part of the summer to give those offices time to adjust to the reopening of
the economy, get some revenue under their belt before they would have to start making payments for us. So,
again, we think that's the prudent thing to do, both for the dental practice and for ourselves?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Okay. And then, just maybe a subtle question here more on the P&L, but what are you seeing on the card
revenue trends? Are you seeing, I'm assuming you saw a drop and it looks like it's down a little bit year-over-year
and certainly sequentially, but are you seeing stabilization there or changes in activity churns?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Chris Merrywell A
Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. Jon, I think that there certainly has been a resi drop, I think you'll start to see as you said some
stabilization, based on it will shift. So from in person purchases to more online purchases, things of that nature.
We're also looking and expecting some pent-up demand, as things start to become reopened that people will get
back out there and while spend money. But certain parts of the industry through this process has continued to do
very well and those of course for people who are using their cards. So, let's say, it's fair to stable.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Thanks a lot.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
Jacquelynne Bohlen Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi. Good morning, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Hello, Jacque.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jacquelynne Bohlen Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Andy, I – hi. Andy I apologize if you mentioned this already in your prepared remarks and I just missed it. But the
migration from the ag portfolio that went on to non-accrual in the quarter. What sector is that from?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew L. McDonald A
Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
It's primarily from the fishing industry in the State of Alaska. So, last fishing season was primarily, what they call
the [indiscernible] (43:51), which is a lower quality, water that goes as they say slam it in the can. They delayed
the opening of that. And so, the quality of the fish was less and so we had a couple of fish processors that as a
result they have lower quality fish, which attracts the lower quality price and that puts stress on their business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jacquelynne Bohlen Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And is that what they charge off in the quarter related to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew L. McDonald A
Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
No. The charge- off was related to a row crop operation in Eastern Washington.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jacquelynne Bohlen Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And I would guess that even though it was a little bit elevated in both these metrics in the quarter, or it's just
kind of normal course of business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew L. McDonald A
Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. We had one charge-off of $4 million, which really drove the charge offs for the quarter. It was an
extraordinary situation with this row crop farmer and I would not characterize it as normal business strain...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jacquelynne Bohlen Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 30-Apr-2020
Jacquelynne Bohlen Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. So, much more a micro issue than a macro issue?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew L. McDonald A
Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jacquelynne Bohlen Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And then, also I wanted to talk a little about the press release noted some efficiency initiatives that where
ongoing and I know that you give a range of where you anticipate expenses to be in, just in light of investments
and COVID-19 related costs, but maybe just a little bit of color on what kind of initiatives you're looking at right
now from an efficiency standpoint?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric Eid A
Executive VP, Chief Digital & Technology Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Well, with regards to the digital, we're essentially done with our oversized digital spend at this juncture, Jacque,
and this has become part of our run rate. That being said, we are going to continue to invest in innovative
solutions, keep us competitive and remain relevant with our clients. But some of the things that are coming as
well, we've got the small business lending platform coming and the new account opening fund there. They are
tracking and – but we're just offsetting, I mean, it's just part of our run rate right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jacquelynne Bohlen Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
I'll add. Some of the other things that we've done, it's the combination of the things we've been doing over the
past few years and starting to get higher adoption rates. There's obviously some of that has accelerated with
people learning how to conduct business differently and through digital channels. But also it's some of the things
that are – have always been ongoing and that's what Eric was getting at, it's part of our DNA is, looking for how
we can do something better. I'd say in the last six months, we've taken a look at functionally how we're aligned
and we've been able to eliminate and reduce some redundancy.
And that has some efficiency or some improvement in terms of our non-interest expense run rate. There are still
some of the things that we've learned actually as we went through the Paycheck Protection Program project.
There are some other areas as we talk with our bankers, they say, they've learned how they can do things more
efficiently that's the silver lining in this cloud that we're under now with COVID-19 is that people are finding
different ways.
And when we come out the other side, I think we're going to leverage some of the spend that we've had focus that
we've had, as well as some new opportunities that we have uncovered through this. So, that's kind of a high level
90,000-foot overview of the types of things that we've been working on and we'll continue to work on.

Andrew L. McDonald A
Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Yeah. I'll provide some color on that too, Jacque, just with regards to the PPP program. We digitized the whole
process from the loan application, all the way through fulfillment. And we use the existing capabilities that we
have and we did it rapidly. And there are some work we would have been able to keep up with the demand and
we tend to funding requirement without having all hands on deck and that digital that one really helped us good to
saw with finish line.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jacquelynne Bohlen Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. And understanding that you're not going to provide guidance as to the number of loans or the dollar value,
when you did the PPP program, was that open to existing customers, or was it existing and some potential new
relationships?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clint E. Stein A
President, Chief Executive Officer, and Director, Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Jacque, we chose to follow the process to work with existing clients and not use it as an opportunity to prospect
property demand and the most important thing we can do is take care of our clients throughout this process.
