Joseph M. Otting
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Sal, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. Before I go into my prepared
remarks, I'd like to also offer my apologies for the late notification for today's earnings call. Clearly, this is not the
standard we intend to operate by in the future, and we will notify you in a timely manner in the future quarters.
However, we made some big promises for this meeting when we met on March 7, which was a very tall order.
And being a new management team, not only did we have to obtain and analyze information, we had to ensure
we had both controls and processes and completed the credit review that we had indicated that we would
conduct.
As I indicated, when we first got together on March 7, I had really three overarching items that I wanted to focus
on in my first 12 weeks. The first was to reevaluate and get our forecast accurate and formulate strategies around
the businesses. We wanted to conduct, review and understand our credit risk in the portfolio. And it was very
important for us to engage with our regulators and develop relationships because they were very important to our
overall organization and building our risk framework. We think that these were in critical components. We think
we've done a tremendous amount of work on that, and we think you'll find through the slide presentation today,
we came along, really a long ways in the last four weeks since the new team has come together.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 01-May-2024
So now turning to the first quarter, during the quarter the company took a number of actions designed to lay down
the groundwork for our return to long-term sustainable profitability, more in line with our regional bank peers. First
and foremost, we successfully completed little over $1 billion equity raise anchored by Liberty Strategic Capital, a
firm led by former Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, along with Hudson Bay Capital Management, Reverence
Capital Partners and Citadel Global Equities. The completion of this equity raise significantly strengthens our
capital and liquidity position and really demonstrates the confidence that the new investors have in the turnaround
currently underway at the company.
Second, we bolstered our board of directors and executive management team. In conjunction with the capital
raise, we reduced the size of our board to nine members and added five new directors, all who bring extensive
banking and turnaround experience to the bank. In addition, I have known for a long time and view them as
independent thinkers and will challenge management appropriately as very strong board members. More recently,
we announced the appointment of four senior leaders to our executive management team, each who have deep
industry knowledge and extensive backgrounds in their respective fields.
I think when you think about the characteristics of the people that have joined us, they all are coming from very
strong organizations with backgrounds from organizations like US Bank, Bank of America, and most of us have
worked together either at one of those institutions or at OneWest Bank. So we understand the kind of culture and
the type of risk organization that we want collectively to build and we all came from those organizations that
reviewed and the industry as very high performing organizations. I'm confident, together with the newly
reconstructed board, we'll be able to drive our strategic initiatives forward and solidify our position as the leading
regional bank. We've done this before and we feel we can do it again.
Third, we completed an in-depth due diligence process of our multifamily and commercial real estate portfolios,
including the office portfolio performed both by the bank and separately by an independent third-party. We
increased our credit loss reserves as a result of information from this review and other analysis we performed
during the quarter. Now, I'll take you through the earnings presentation, beginning with slide 2. On slide 2, it
highlights some of our strategy, and as I said, we bolstered the management and the board. We've developed
what we think we can share with you today, a realistic operating plan to get the organization by the end of 2026 at
or above industry standards for performance.
We have achievable capital and earnings forecasts. We have implemented now a rigorous credit risk
management process, and we've strengthened the talent on the credit risk process and we maintain sufficient
liquidity as we walked you through earlier today.
Our future targets are that we will be a strong, diversified regional bank producing a return on average assets of
1%, a return on average total – TCE of 11% to 12%, and a CET1 ratio 11% or 12%. And we'll walk you through
those detail later today. The goal is to create long-term, meaningful shareholder value. 2024 will obviously be a
transition year to a more normalized 2025 and 2026.
And page 3 gives you a highlight. And on that page, 7 of the 10 people are new to the company within the last five
months and that adjuncts three important people that were legacy NYCB and Flagstar people who have joined the
organization.
And slide 4 gives a quick overview of the board members and the depth and knowledge that they bring to the
organization.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 01-May-2024
On slide 5, slide 5 is a key slide outlining our path to profitability. As you can see, we feel that we have multiple
levers to get us there. And I'll spend a few minutes kind of walking our way through that. So our number one,
obviously, as you know, the industry is confronted with the rapid rise in interest rates. A lot of the loans that were
fixed rates that had either three, five or seven interest rate resets. A number of those are starting to come forward
now and will go through a repricing process. And so that will benefit, obviously, net interest income and NIM.
Number two, focus on workout of problem loans. We recently brought new resources into the company to bolster
the talent in dealing with the workout side of our organization. And this obviously will have long-term reductions in
our NPA.
Number three, we will begin to build a more robust middle market relationship banking franchise. Today, we
roughly have $20 billion in C&I loan outstandings in the portfolio. That will create a really good basis for us to
move forward. And we see that business over $30 billion in the next three to five years. Just as a comment, really,
I spent the vast majority of my career in this space. We successfully grew this business at US Bank under my
leadership. We created that business at OneWest Bank in a very short order, and put billions of dollars in new
loan outstanding, attracted the right kind of talent. And I think that we will be able to do that here, and that will be
one of the more successful areas of our story when we look to have a balanced balance sheet.
On number five, we look to fully integrate all three banks. Currently, today, in 2024, we integrated the Flagstar
and NYCB onto a single platform called Fiserv. And we have – the signature legacy is on FIS. And so we will look
to get to one platform in the future. And obviously it's a very costly proposition when you're operating on two
different platforms and consolidating that from an informational perspective.
And number six, the efficiency ratio tells the story. We are an organization with an 80% efficiency ratio. Most of us
came from US Bank where Jerry Grundhofer taught us how to squeeze nickels. And so it's in our culture, in our
DNA. And we will aggressively look at our cost structure and make determinations of how we will be able to bring
that back in with industry standards.
As far as medium-term items, we will, as I indicated, look to diversify our loan portfolio. Our commercial real
estate portfolio today is around $47 billion, our strategic target to bring that down around the $30 billion range.
We'll improve funding by growing core deposits. And we think that will be helpful by building more relationship
type strategies. And then number three [indiscernible] (00:11:31) derivatives, commercial cards and syndication
capabilities, and we can drive those further and deeper into our relationships.
One comment I would like to make back on to the top, in the short term, I jumped over number four, which is sale
or run-off of non-strategic assets. We continue to look at the portfolio of assets on the balance sheet and started a
process within the organization, we're reviewing that. And we do have – and we have identified an opportunity
that could close quickly for $5 billion at par, minus a transaction fee that we believe could close within a 60- to 70-
day period that we may be announcing here in the next week or so.
So, we've already begun that process of looking at which assets fit strategically going forward. And by doing that,
we'll obviously create additional capital for the balance sheet and we'll obviously create $5 billion of liquidity.
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Craig Gifford, our newly appointed CFO who I've really enjoyed the
opportunity to partner with on this project. He's a man of tremendous strengths and talents.
And so, Craig, I'll turn it over to you.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 01-May-2024
Craig E. Gifford
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you, Joseph. And thanks to all those who were able to join the call today. I look forward to meeting many of
you in the near future. Over the next few slides, I'll take you through how we think about our forecast, our loan
portfolio, and our credit risk and our deposit base and liquidity.
If you turn to slide 6, you can see a summary of the next three years expectations of our financial performance. At
the very beginning, you can see that we expect our diluted EPS, and this is on a fully converted basis for our
outstanding preferred, growing from our current level through to about $0.65 to $0.75 at the end of 2026. As
Joseph mentioned, you can see that we have expectations to reduce our efficiency ratio down to – from the
current level down to peer levels. And we will see that happening through integration of our previous mergers and
a close look at our overlapping cost structures.
Our capital ratios were certainly bolstered by the recent capital infusion that Joseph mentioned, and we see that
moving to peer levels over the next two years through our earnings power and retention of the earnings into
capital.
Our return on assets, we see improving through a rebalancing of our asset mix, as well as loan repricing into
current market rates. Our return on equity – our return on tangible equity will benefit as a result of these items and
will drive us back to an 11% to 12% return on tangible capital over the outlook period. And finally, we believe that
that will result in a tangible book value in the $7 range as we get to the end of 2026. These all reflect the
strategies that Joseph outlined on the previous page.
If you turn to page 7, this is really where the rubber meets the road, how is this going to happen. Starting at the
top of our income statement, our net interest income will benefit as we see loans reprice over the next couple of
years. Our expectations with respect to rates that we've built into these numbers follow the median rate forecast.
We have about $4 billion a year over the next three years that will reprice, and that's reflected in these numbers.
We're actually relatively interest rate risk insensitive right now. We recently exited some [indiscernible] (00:15:09)
swaps that moved us into a relatively flat neutral position. Our net interest margin certainly decreased this quarter.
That was a result really of two things, our need to move into a bit more – a different shift in our funding mix and
more wholesale funding, as well as an increase in our borrowing costs. We expect to see that improve over the
next two years, again, principally a result of repricing of our loan portfolio.
From a provision expense, as Joseph mentioned, after taking a deep dive look at our credit portfolio and looking
at current market conditions, we did increase our loan loss reserves in the quarter. We do expect to see an
elevated level of provisioning through the rest of the year as market conditions potentially impact more borrowers.
But after that, we expect to see a return to a more normalized through-the-cycle level of losses, and we have
shown you our expectations here.
Our noninterest income expectations are relatively flat in these targets, but we actually see upside as we balance
our customer mix towards broader relationships, as Joseph mentioned. Noninterest expense, we do expect that
we'll be able to drive efficiencies through our platform as we focus on – as we focus on our merger activity, we
have systems, processes and infrastructure duplication that we do believe that present us opportunities to reduce
our costs. Over the forecast period, we've assumed between 10% and 15% reduction in our cost structure.
If you move to slide 8, you can see where we currently stand. Our equity position – our equity infusion in March
has us at 10.1% CET1 ratio on a fully converted basis. You can see that the reserve increase that we did in the

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 01-May-2024
first quarter brings us to a 1.58% allowance to loan loss as a percent of total loans, excluding our warehouse
loans. And importantly, and I'll cover this in a few minutes in more depth, 84% of our deposits are insured
deposits. We have a very low level of uninsured deposits compared to our peers at the moment.
If you move to slide 9, I'll talk a little bit about our loan portfolio and the level of credit review that we did on a
number of our higher risk positions in the first quarter. This slide presents our loan portfolio in total at the left and
then covers on the right-hand side the number of loans and the percentage of the portfolio that we did what we
refer to as a deep dive. That deep dive involved a lot of internal analysis, as well as getting third-party information
about property valuations.
And we've taken that information and considered the credit exposure in the portfolio, and I would say it confirms
the potential for credit loss that was previously disclosed in our materials. You can see on the bottom right-hand
side the dollars and the percent of the portfolio that we covered, and I'll cover the office and multi-family portfolios
in detail on the next two pages. But at a high level, we had a deep dive on roughly 75% of our office portfolio and
roughly 30% of our multi-family portfolio.
If you move to slide 10, you can see what I'm saying in the top right-hand corner. We did a deep dive review of
$2.5 billion of a $3 billion office portfolio. Certainly, office portfolio – the office portfolio is in a market segment that
is suffering a high degree of stress. Our overall – it doesn't represent a particularly large percentage of our overall
loan portfolio at only $3 billion. And you can see that we, on the bottom right-hand side, stand at a 10.3%
allowance to total office loans, excluding owner-occupied loans.
On the bottom left, you can see that in our deep dive review, we covered our top 50 loans, and those had an
average principal balance of about $50 million. The remainder of the portfolio is fairly homogenous on average
loan balance you can see of about $5 million, and we believe those have a differentiated credit risk, largely
because they have more refinancing options just given their loan size.
If you move to slide 11, you can see more information about our multi-family portfolio. It's certainly our largest
segment in the loan portfolio at $36.9 billion. You can see that we covered 36% of that portfolio in our deep dive
credit review. And on the left-hand side, you can see that at the end of the quarter, we have a 1.3% allowance to
total loan coverage ratio in the multi-family portfolio. Again, on the bottom right, you can see that the loan sizes
that we covered in our deep dive were those loans that were largely above $50 million, and the loan sizes that we
think of as more of a homogenous basis portfolio are around $5 million.
In the bullets, you'll note that we expect about $2.6 billion of our multi-family book to reprice in 2024. I mentioned
an expectation of about $4 billion in total. We've had very good success with repricing of our existing portfolio over
the last 15 months. We've had $2.1 billion of loans that have repriced. About a fourth of those have actually paid
off at the repricing date, and the other three-fourths have repriced up to current market rates, and we've seen
almost no delinquencies to-date. In other words, the borrowers have been able to cover debt service in spite of
the elevated level of interest rates.
If you move to slide 12, we have some information on our non-office portfolio, roughly $7.4 billion. Importantly,
you can see on the bottom right that we have a very diverse book. There's no real credit concentrations. We did
review about a fourth of this book and we don't really see any stresses in the rest of the portfolio.
On page 13 is a break out of our allowance for loan losses and I'll just point out that on the multifamily portfolio,
again, we're at 1.3% allowance coverage ratio, that's up 45 basis points from 82 basis points at the first quarter,

assuming that year-end. And again, you can see the office allowance ratio is 10.3%. The office ratio in particular
puts us at the high end of the range compared to our regional bank peers.
Moving to liquidity, deposits and liquidity, if you turn to page 14, you'll see in the top left hand side that roughly
41% of our deposit base are transactional and lower cost funding. It's not a CD-focused book. That said, we have
looked to the CD market for some recent funding needs. Bottom left hand side, importantly, you can see that our
deposit base has been very stable since the capital infusion, and in fact, we've grown deposits. And that's not only
through the end of March, but subsequent to the end of March, to date, in April, we've seen a very stable deposit
base and stable growth.
I'm sure you know, you've seen that in the market, we have a premium product. We call it the [ph] 5-5-5 product
(00:22:26). Importantly, we're seeing good traction, but it's not so large as to move our margin. It's focused on
new money and new customers that we are bringing to the bank. And I would say that it's not driving an overall
wholesale repricing of our deposit book.
If you turn to slide 15, as I mentioned before, the vast majority of our deposits are insured deposits. We only have
$12.4 billion of uninsured deposits. And on this slide, you can see that we have more cash on the balance sheet
than the entire amount of our uninsured deposits. That's quite unusual compared to regional bank peers. In fact,
from a total liquidity perspective, we have over 200% of our uninsured deposits. We continue to focus on building
liquidity. And as Joseph mentioned, as we look at potential strategic portfolio transactions, we would expect to
see some degree of further built in liquidity coming from those transactions.
Slide 16 is just a brief look at our first quarter financial highlights. We had a net loss to shareholders – to common
shareholders of $335 million for the quarter. That was largely driven by the provisioning of $315 million for the
quarter, certainly elevated. There was a bit of noise as well in our net loss related to our merger-related activities,
which we see declining throughout the year and don't see that carrying over into 2025 and 2026.
And then we also had a bit of noise related to some adjustments from the previous bargaining gain that we
recorded last year as we close out the accounting associated with the Signature transaction. Excluding those and
a more – and at a more normal provision level, you can see that our base operations were actually at a slight net
income level in the first quarter.
And now, I'd like to turn the call back to Joseph. Thank you.

Joseph M. Otting
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Okay. Thank you, Craig. First of all, I appreciate your patience. Since this is really our first opportunity to get
together with all of you, we thought it was very important to go through the deck as opposed to just reading
opening comments, that you could get really the context and details of where the organization is today and then
how we see that transforming into the future. So I hope you found that helpful and useful and we clearly look
forward, Craig and I do, to meeting a number of you and following up and having discussions in further detail and
really what other areas of the packet that you would like to have.
One of the things that we look at is what is the upside for the company, and we are currently trading at roughly
0.42x of fully converted tangible book value of $6.33. This compares to about 1.5 times for Category IV banks and
about 1.4 times for regional banks. I believe this valuation gap will narrow significantly as we execute on our
transformation plan. And this plan is – we're all experienced of going down this journey in this path. We've done it
before.

We know what the end looks like. We know what we have to do to execute on it. And we as an executive
management team are optimistic that we can deliver on the plan. It's going to be a lot of hard work. We recognize
that, but this is a strong team that's come together with a very diversified background that has been in
environments what they see with the strong regional banks can kind of look like.
So, finally, I'd like to really thank all of our teammates for their hard work and commitment to the bank and our
customers. As you can appreciate, I've been here slightly under eight weeks now. Craig has been here two and a
half weeks, but it was very important for us to be able to kind of meet with you as soon as possible and give you
an overview on the organization. And we look forward to fielding any questions from the group.
And operator, I will turn it back over to you now for you to be able to call on people for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION

America. Please go ahead.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Craig. So, appreciate the reason that you all claim around business strategy and credit. Maybe
first question with I guess both of you know this better than most, we are in a tough interest rate backdrop, just
talk to us when you talk about growing the core deposit franchise, which is extremely tough right now for even the
best of banks, in terms of the nuts and bolts of how you can execute that without undue pressure on deposit costs
and also if you don't mind addressing, there's been a fair amount of chatter about talent leaving NYB over the last
few weeks, like how impactful would that be and how much of that is baked into your forecast and outlook from
here? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you very much. So the first question is when you look at kind of the legacy organization, it was kind of a
monoline business where they focused on multifamily and then they raised high money market and CD rates to

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 01-May-2024
fund that. And then the evolution with Flagstar brought more relationship deposits into the fold. And then the third
leg of that was the Signature Bank joining the organization through the FDIC-assisted transaction.
So we've been able to through those processes get to is, when Craig showed on the chart, 41% of our deposits
are actually noninterest bearing and interest bearing, which are transaction-related accounts. And if you ask most
people, Ebrahim, who's your bank? Most people identify no matter if you have $1 million in your brokerage
account and you have your mortgage with somebody, they usually identify with whose their checking account is.
And so we have a strong baseline in our retail franchise to be able to grow off those relationships.
And then as we look to expand into the C&I business, usually if you can be important to the customer stack and
usually in the middle market, in the specialty industry business, there's usually three to five banks. And if you can
be important in that stack, you will usually get the relationship products and those will be deposits, cash
management, derivatives, syndication activity. And so, really our big focus is developing and recruiting talent into
that space and building upon what we already have. We do already have some very good businesses in that
space. And that's where I think, as we execute on that strategy, you'll get less interest sensitive clients and more
clients that are interested in supporting the overall relationship.
The second part of your question I think dealt with the Signature Bank. And what I would say about Signature
Bank is, we really want to build the baseline of our C&I commercial business around the Signature Bank teams.
We really have a unique franchise that we were able to obtain where we have commercial bankers and private
banking people from Signature Bank that are really, in some of the most lucrative markets in the United States are
in the southwest, the northeast, the southeast, and then around the Greater Lakes.
I will say it has been a tough integration of them into our bank. Some of it has been our fault and we have to take
responsibility that not all of our products have flowed effectively for them. But I would also say, some of the clients
did not – some of the legacy clients of Signature did not meet our BSA standards and those clients are no longer
with Flagstar. So, there also was a little bit of a uniqueness of trying to fit. They had a decentralized risk model.
We have a centralized risk model. So, I think there was a higher standard around that.
But we have lost roughly 200 people in that group. We do track on a daily basis. The departure balance when the
teams left was $6,176 million. And today, the current balance is $6 billion. So roughly slightly less than $200
million of deposits have left. And we do recognize some deposits will take time to migrate out of the organization.
But I think we've done a couple – there's been a couple of contrary things why that has stuck is when those teams
left, they frequently did not take the whole team.
So, the team was 10, they took 3 and left 7 people. Those seven people have done an extraordinary job of
stepping up and calling on those contacts and retaining those. And that really has been quite positive. And where
there were smaller teams, where the whole team left, we quickly reassigned those to other teams. And so, I think
the combination of that has helped us be able to retain a significant amount of those deposits and be in a position
to kind of move forward.
So, there's always that risk for some more deposits, but it isn't like we've had a big wholesale. And as Craig
pointed out on the slide, we've had very – we've actually had pretty good growth in deposits during the quarter
and we continue to see that carrying through into April as well and really it's strong growth in the retail franchise
and growth in the private bank, so where you would perhaps anticipate that that would be rolling down, it's
actually been rolling up.

And just to add on, as Joseph mentioned, there's been very little deposit departures since the press associated
with the adviser – with the group of advisors that left, a couple of hundred billion – I'm sorry, yeah, a couple
hundred million dollars of departures. All of that occurred in the first two weeks. And over the last couple of
weeks, it's just been a trickle. Very positive.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Ebrahim, one of the other things is like most of the – those teams have left for small banks and some of these
clients just can't be serviced by those small banks. So, they may move part of their relationship, but if they're fully
integrated into the bank, it's very complicated to de-link the treasury management and all the services and
systems that you have. So my guess is we'll have split relationships with some of those small banks if things that
can move over, but we've been able to retain a significant portion of the deposits and activities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
And we've been calling, [ph] Sandra (00:33:48) and I have spent a lot of time calling on the private banking
clients, meeting with the people, trying to understand, as I said, some of this is our fault, the integration process.
So making sure we understand how we can be more responsive to credit needs, account opening and those
things that can make it more transparent for those customers to integrate into the bank.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
That's great color. And if I can have one quick follow up, so appreciate all the deep dive you've done on the office
and multifamily. When all this began, there was a lot of concern around New York City rent stabilized multifamily
book. And I appreciate there's more to do in terms of the deep dive review. Just give us a sense, like for the
longest time I've covered the bank, it felt like the lost content in that book should be minimal. And I would love to
hear your thoughts in terms of how we should think about the rent stabilized New York City multifamily and your
view on the cost content? Thank you.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, couple of things. I mean, we all know about the 2019 legislative changes and then the expectation perhaps
that the Supreme Court would rule against that and they haven't. So we're kind of in the Army, so to speak, with
what we have. We may have hit the low point now that some of the jurisdictions are doing tax abatements. We've
looked at the very big multi-families that have large exposures and we'll do more work on the remainder of the
portfolio during this particular quarter.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 01-May-2024
But as we say, the revenue was pretty solid in that space. I mean, there's very few vacancies. They know the
revenue. Where there's been problems really is how on the other side of the operating expenses have risen.
People will tell you buy a new HVAC system. It's 30% or 40% higher than what it was two years ago. Hiring
people to do work on site, interest rate resets, just a lot of negative consequences on the expense side.
We – on one of the chart pages, Craig, yeah, chart 11, I think one of the important parts about our portfolio is, is if
you looked at – it's the part that shows the past due [indiscernible] (00:36:11) the one that shows the past due, so
30 to 89 days past due, anyway, while he's finding that page, Ebrahim, one of the things that our portfolio has
exhibited is amazing resiliency where clients are not going past due.
So where we see that perhaps the property is over a 100% loan to value and just for the properties that debt
service coverage is low 1 to 1, these are frequently long-time owned properties by families. And they are
supporting those properties from resources amongst the family, because they don't want those property – to lose
those properties. And, well, in those instances, we don't have guarantees, potential tax liabilities are motivating
people to be at the table with us negotiating to make sure that they have time to kind of manage their way.
And Ebrahim, what I was referencing is on page 8, the third item up from the bottom is – or excuse me, second
item up from the bottom is total loans 30 to 89 days past due. At the end of the first quarter, we were 26% versus
Category IV was 64% and then 50 to 100 was 29%. So, our portfolio, while we do feel there's loss given defaults
and probability defaults, the portfolio has held up very well from the standpoint of the borrowers continuing to
make payments.

Hey. Good morning, guys, and congrats on getting all this together in such a short period of time. It's very
impressive. Following up on your comments on the $6 billion in deposits, appreciate all the color on that, what's
the mix of that $6 billion that's remaining? So, what portion of that is DDA versus interest-bearing or higher rate
CDs?
And then if you could just talk about how many of those teams are remaining at the bank and where do you stand

Yeah. There's about 100 teams left with the bank today. So, if you said there was roughly 130 at the beginning,
there's 100 left. And we have in place cash payment after one year, cash payment after two years, and then an
equity – RSRs that would vest in the third year kind of on a cliff vesting. And – but I would also say, Dave, money
is one thing. But if you're servicing your clients in that space and they have a really unique model, which I actually
like, is there are single point of contact for their customers and I'm supportive of that model.
If you're not able to support your clients, you're going to be frustrated. And you're not going to stay at an institution
you don't think that will give you those tools. And so really – we've got to fix that. And if we can fix that, I think
people can really have a successful career here and we can take care of their clients because we have the ability
to execute. So, lockups are one thing, but if you're not able to take care of your customers and that's your
franchise, then I don't think there's any money that would keep you out at the bank. And I don't know if you have
the number...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
To put some numbers around the deposit mix, that $5.8 billion, only about $250 million of that is CDs. So, it's not
– it's stable because of the relationships in the business, not because of maturity terms structure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Rochester Q

What piece of that is DDA, noninterest bearing?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A

We've been all over it. It's been one of my personal initiatives. We meet, we have met and continue to meet with
[indiscernible] (00:40:30) bankers, but I'll be honest with you, most of them are just really good commercial
bankers and we're kind of working through. We first worked through some of the approval levels that were
assigned and we got them back to kind of what their approval levels were with Signature Bank. And then we've
been working through the credit process. We've assigned a particular person to work through how credits get
approved. So, for the most part, I think we're ironing those kind of things out. We've kind of basically gone down
to a trickle of people leaving at this point. So, I really think the people that are here are engaged and they want to
be part of the organization.

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes, we can. We are not assuming any significant reduction in the modeling that represents the numbers on
pages 6 and 7 in our balance sheet size. As Joseph mentioned, we are thinking about and looking at a number of
strategic transactions, but we don't have a balance sheet reduction as our principal target. We'll make strategic
moves that are right for the business and right for our balance sheet and importantly increase our shareholder
returns.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q

Okay. And then secondly, I think your Lead Independent Director had suggested on CNBC recently that the

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
It's not baked into our plan. What I would – obviously, with my background of being the Comptroller of the
Currency, I have good visions into what a good credit – or good risk management infrastructure looks like, what is
first line of defense and second line of defense and third line of defense should be. And by no means are we in a
position in the short-term to be in that position to be acquiring other entities. We'll clean up our house and get it in
order, and really our focus is to work with our regulators at the OCC and the Fed. They're important partners to us
to guide us and partner with us as we build the infrastructure here.

We have a lot of work to do in this organization to put the risk structure in place, and we're committed to doing
that. We've taken some actions where we formed a committee at the bank. We're hiring a person to coordinate in
the organization. It's their job. We formed a management committee. We're really focused on it and we want to
deliver, because we think it's important for us. We're not doing it because anybody else wants us to do at KPMG

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A

And I would tell you that the financial impact of that infrastructure needs and build is included in the financial

reinvested in developing risk management infrastructure.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mark Fitzgibbon Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Great. And then just lastly, would you consider selling a part of the branch franchise? Are there any sort of far-
flung areas where you see an opportunity to kind of shrink down part of the branch franchise?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I don't think so, not at this point. I think we really like the deposits and how the bank has operated in the retail
bank. If anything, we would like to get more products that they could have available. We obviously are really good
at originating mortgages, and being better at originating mortgages out of the branch could be a strong initiative.
Reggie is focused on doing more small business lending out of the branches as well. So, I think we're more into
how do we enhance what we offer through our branch network. They've done a really strong job. We have a very
powerful deposit base out of the branch network, and we think we can grow upon that.

Can you share where you are looking to run the loan-to-deposit ratio over the next two to three years?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. I think that the loan-to-deposit ratio as we – as our current balance sheet mix looks will continue out at least
over the next 24 months as we get beyond that and look at our wholesale funding and our on-balance sheet
liquidity position. You might see us move to a lower reliance on wholesale deposits – I'm sorry, on wholesale
funding and perhaps an increase in deposits that would reduce that ratio a bit. But I don't expect to see a
transition significantly in the next 24 months.

Yeah.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A

...we might see some reduction of loans that would reduce the loans-to-deposit ratio just through strategic

shareholder value, particularly by releasing some capital demand.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 01-May-2024
Right. Hey, Chris, one of the – I'd say the overarching strategies within the company is to really look at where we
have scale and where we have relationships. Some businesses where we don't know the customer, they're just
singularly using the balance sheet, those would be businesses that probably would be complicated and difficult for
us to hold on to in the future. And the market today is – there's a lot of buyers for that kind of product. And so, as
we would execute on transactions, as Craig said, that would give us the ability to use that liquidity either to reduce
wholesale borrowings or increase our liquidity, so.

Joseph M. Otting A

Yeah. Chris, I wanted to make sure people are aware of it in case we announce it in a day or two. But I don't want
to go into details. I think at this point, it's not appropriate to do that. But we are right at the doorstep of deciding
whether we're going to move forward with that transaction.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 01-May-2024
Hi. Good morning. This is Brian Wilczynski filling in for Manan. Can you talk about your approach to complying
with the long-term debt rules that were proposed last year? And related question is what do the rating agencies
need to see in order for you to have a better rating? Thanks.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I'll move to the last one, they need – the second question, they need to see a reliable path towards earnings and
the ability to demonstrate our understanding of the credit risk. I don't see that as a immediate term. We certainly
think that there are opportunities for us to demonstrate our understanding of the business and our financial
performance in a repeatable way that could lead to upgrade potential or a positive outlook in a medium-term
timeframe.
In terms of the long-term debt rules, I think where we stand from a capital position will benefit – our funding will
benefit as we continue to increase our capital ratios. But we continue to evaluate our balance sheet position and
haven't – really haven't made any long-term decisions on how we'd be structured there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Wilczynski Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay, great. Thank you. And then, just as a follow-up, when it comes to bringing down the commercial real estate
concentration, can you give some more details on the types of commercial real estate that you might choose to
maintain or grow over time versus what you are more likely to deemphasize?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, clearly, the biggest concentration is in the multi-family sector of the portfolio. So, to move any significant
numbers, you would have to reduce your exposure in that particular area. I would say from a risk perspective, it
would be our desire to reduce our exposure in the office marketplace. We've done a pretty deep dive on $2.5
billion of the $3.3 billion of the portfolio. And so, clearly, there's stress there. I think there's been a fundamental
change on how people are going to work and what space is going to be used in the future. It's just – it's difficult to
see the end on office. And so, I would say if I was like – where would I like to see the first reductions, it would be
in office. But then eventually, if you get down to that $30 billion level, we would definitely have to go into the multi-
family book and reduce our exposure there.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A

Craig E. Gifford A

So, we started with the largest not only because it's – they're large loans and we get more coverage with less
count, but because they're generally more institutionally owned as opposed to either family owned or privately
owned investments. And the decisioning factors are different there, as Joseph pointed out. Additionally, obviously,
as I mentioned, the refinance risk is a more of a challenge when you're talking about a $100 million credit as
opposed to a $3 million credit.
We will continue through our standard and improving credit processes to take a closer look at the smaller loan
portfolio. And I'd say the next cut would be in a more standardized approach to look at our portfolio balances over
about a $10 million threshold. As we continue to look at that and as we continue to see borrower performance in
the current environment, that could impact our reserving levels. But we believe that we have appropriate levels of
reserves for the portfolio right now.

One other thing. The next phase is we're kind of looking at the large borrowers. And what we mean by that is
instead of large loans, we're going to look at whether it's a consolidation of the borrowers, and then also any
relationship where there's $10 million or more. By June 30, we'll be through that process. So, when we report to
you next time as well, we'll be able to kind of give some statistics around that. So, we are kind of waterfalling our
way down through the portfolio to make sure that we're comfortable with obviously the risk ratings and the
reserves against the portfolio.

Benjamin Gerlinger Q

Got you. And then, just to follow up here quickly, I know you gave a guidance of an elevated loan loss provision
throughout the rest of this year and it wanes pretty materially in 2025 and 2026. For this year, what is it really
predicated on? Is it more so allowance building or is there some sort of – as you push things out, you might have
to be marking a loss similar to earlier this year? Just kind of – I'm just trying to get a sense of why you're
anticipating higher provisioning going forward [indiscernible] (00:54:26).

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 01-May-2024
Well, I think that – no, it's a good question. I think that what we've seen is repricing at higher interest rate levels
obviously put stress on debt service coverage ratios for some borrowers. We've had really good experience, and
that's particularly relevant to the way we model credit loss for reserving purposes. But we also know that there will
be some classes of borrowers that will experience stress. And as we begin to get more insight into current market
level debt service coverage ratios and see how those borrowers – a broader population of those borrowers react
in reset environments, we could see that until we – until the rate curve comes down that there'll be additional
stress. Our expectations are based upon the current rate curve and the current market conditions, and those
conditions could change. The Fed's talking about high longer and higher longer, and that could have an impact on
future conditions, and we've considered that as we put our forecast together.

Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Thanks. Good morning and thanks for taking all of our questions and information. I wanted to drill down on the net
reserve build. So, if we look at the provision guide that you gave us this year and next year, what type of charge-
offs should we anticipate and how should net reserves change over time?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yes. We anticipate an elevated level of charge-offs. We had about $80 million this quarter. And in our outlook, we
don't distinguish dramatically between charge-offs and reserving – I should say and reserve build, because they
all ultimately reflect the underlying credit loss of the portfolio. But I think that we'll see a ramping of charge-offs
over the next couple of quarters and as we get out beyond that, whether it's the charge-off or reserve build, we
think it'll come back to a more normalized run rate credit loss.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Great. And that some of those charge offs are taken, would some of that be kind of new loans or the reset and
just taken in the value impairment or would some of those be loans that leave the bank altogether?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So it's loans that − the charge-offs this quarter are principally a couple of office loans and as we talked about the
office market is pretty stressed and it was a couple of stressed office loans that got to the point where the
investors chose to have a – come to us and we had to take over the property. I think – I don't know that we've

taken on at this point but we look at them and we believe that a loss is likely on those. It's just a couple of – it's a
couple of office loans.

ahead.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yes. Hi. Good morning. So regards to being a Category IV bank, in the 10-K you noted anticipating significant
expenses to develop policies, programs and systems that comply with the enhanced standards, would have
assumed the revamping of risk management infrastructure would also be costly? But I think, Craig, you noted
that's included in the forecast today, so on today's call, it sounds you're optimistic about driving expenses down,
which was seen in your forecast on page 7. Can you just help reconcile these expected cost pressures and
efficiencies you expect over time?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Hi, Bernard. Thanks for the question. So, if you look on page 7, you can see a walk forward, as I mentioned, it's
roughly a five-year between 10% and 15% reduction. Obviously, there are some of those costs that are fixed that
we can't do a lot about. And there are other portions that are very manageable. If you think about our
organization, we took three – three – it wasn't a large bank that – rather a small bank and there's only a little bit of
opportunity to drive efficiency out of the organization. There's three banks that had three full sets of infrastructure.
And while we've partially been able to take advantage of the opportunities there, there's certainly more to come.
As Joseph mentioned, we have a strong existing employee base, but we brought in a number of management
team members that have experience building risk management functions. We've done this before and we have a
pretty good feel of what that scale looks like and what the costs are for that. And so, as we think about our
forecast for the future, I think there's a pretty high degree of predictability around what the costs are associated
with the risk management build. And we've contemplated that in these numbers.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bernard Von Gizycki Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then just another follow-up from the 10-K. You noted a number of items included in the remediation
status of the reported material weaknesses identified by your auditors. I mean, just a few items noted included in,
frequency of reporting, expanding the use of independent credit analysis, reducing the reliance on internally
created tools and just assessing staffing qualifications. Could you just help explain the situation you inherited? It
does sound like the department was working entirely on manual spreadsheets. I have no defined reporting or
guidelines. So any color here would be helpful to just understand the situation that you inherited.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 01-May-2024
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, I think that probably the biggest indicator of the situation was just that there wasn't as much visibility to the
developing situation in the office market and to a small degree in the multifamily market and the impacts that that
would have on provisioning. So that ultimately passed through in the 10-K and the fourth quarter in a big reserve.
I think what we've demonstrated here is that this management team, along with the existing staff, have done a
good job to really catch up, so to speak. Now, our internal infrastructure still has a lot of improvement to go and
we continue to work on those action plans. Again, many of us are pretty new here, and so we're jumping into
existing action plans and bringing our knowledge and experience into how we can further improve those. So we
have a ways to go. We're not done. But over the last four to six weeks, we've done a lot of work to make up for
some of the previous deficiencies, at least as we stand today.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. And the other thing that I would add is we have brought very experienced talent into the company from Jim
Simons, who, for 20 years, was the Head Approval Officer and ran the workout for commercial real estate at US
Bank, joined us. He's called the Special Assistant to the President, but we wanted Jim to come in and look at all
the processes, the forecasting of the NPLs, charge-offs.
And so Jim is working on that project right now, and we're adding additional staff into that infrastructure as well.
So we recognize the need to beat that up, but we don't see that as a heavy lift for us. We think that's more just
bringing our expertise and the talents together. The information is available to us. We just need to formulate that
information in the right way.

Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Follow-up on credit quality. So following the review of some of the more troubled
exposures in your loan book – office, multifamily, and traditional CRE – just wondering what kind of price declines
you guys came across as you built reserves. Just looking for some...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah, it depends on the book. But I would tell you that our reserving process contemplated 42% price declines in
office and 30-ish range for multifamily. That's the way we've modeled it. If you think about LTVs, that's why we
see office is pretty stressed because our origination LTVs at 42% puts us pretty close.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 01-May-2024
On the multifamily book, our origination LTVs were in the 60% range. Our origination debt service coverage was
in the 1.6-plus coverage ratio level. So if we think about current LTVs being in that multi-family book, perhaps
down as much as 30%, which is what we've modeled. That puts the overall loan to value ratio potentially in the
high-80s, low-90s range. And if you think about the resets and the rate level for resets, depending on where we
are in the rate curve. And when those reset, they're sort of hovering in that 1 to 1.1 debt service coverage ratio,
which is why we're not seeing a lot of defaults, is because they're able to cover the debt service. They're not
making as much money as they'd like for owners, but they're able to cover the debt service.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Casey Haire Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Got it. Thanks. And then on slide 8, you guys outlined your relative position versus Cat IV banks. One of the
metrics not here is the CRE concentration. It sounds like you guys are – your forecast is based on a flat balance
sheet, aside from the $5 billion potential sale. But a flat balance sheet with C&I, I think, Craig, I think you
mentioned a $10 billion growth opportunity in C&I longer term. Just wondering, how does the CRE concentration
evolve in the coming years on a flat balance sheet?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
I think it evolves as we – as we work through the refinance reset and maturity cycle over the next 2 to 3 years and
retain the credits that we want where we have broader business relationships and allow the credits that are more
balance sheet use-focused to run off the balance sheet, then we're able to have capital to deploy into these
growing business opportunities.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. And just a point of information, it isn't like we're saying the balance sheet is going to remain flat. In our
baseline case, we had it flat. And then the other attributes of asset sales, winding down businesses could have
obviously impacts to the size of the balance sheet. So it's just in the baseline case. That's where it's at. But,
clearly, we're sitting here three years from now, we would like to be looking down the path of a $30 billion CRE
portfolio.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 01-May-2024
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. So, on-balance sheet liquidity right now is ample. As I pointed out we have quite a bit more on-balance
sheet liquidity today than what we have in uninsured deposits. As I mentioned, to the extent that we do
transactions, I would expect that a good portion of that, at least in the near term, would be contingent on balance
sheet liquidity. I don't really expect to grow the securities portfolio substantially. It'll be pretty short-term liquidity.
As I mentioned, we're pretty interest rate risk neutral right now. I'm not sure I want to extend the duration very far
out. We'll take a look at it, but we're pretty interest rate risk neutral, so we like it the balance of our liquidity mix.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q

Janet Lee Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Good morning. This is actually Janet Lee on for Steve Alexopoulos. Back to your flat balance sheet comment
earlier, is it fair to say that overall deposits are basically saying flattish through 2026 at the $75 billion level? And
in your NII outlook, what is assumed for your noninterest-bearing deposits to bottom out? And can you share color
and how that deposit [indiscernible] (01:07:19) change from here for the remainder of 2024?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Hi, Janet. We've been pretty conservative from a forecasting standpoint. We've assumed a flat mix to date. We do
expect that we'll see – as Joseph mentioned, as we expand our relationships with these customers into deeper
relationships, we expect to see more demand deposit and transactional type funding. And so, there's the
opportunity for upside in terms of our funding mix, but in our base model that we've presented. We haven't
included an optimistic outlook on that, so to speak.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Janet Lee Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And as your CRE loans are coming down to a $30 billion range over the next few years, can you give us
more detailed time line on that and where do you expect your overall loan balances to be at towards the end of
2024? And what's a more normalized level of loan growth for you going forward in 2025 and 2026?

Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So, the portfolio, assuming the forecasts that we've included does not really include a loan mix change in the
outlook. These are more think of them as strategic plans as opposed to forecasting. But as we think about the
potential, as I mentioned, we have about $4 billion a year that will hit resets and maturities over the next three
years. And so, you think about that's the kind of – and the bulk of that is either multifamily or office [indiscernible]
(01:08:51) is multifamily. So as we think about the opportunity, it's that kind of size is what is – would be a natural
opportunity to adjust concentrations over the next three years as opposed to portfolio sales. And then as we think
about loan growth, we have a modeled substantial loan growth in the book here. We kept the balance sheet
relatively flat.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Janet Lee Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And my last question on credit, besides the couple of office charge-offs you had in the first quarter, can you
talk about how much of your rent-regulated multifamily and CRE loans that came due in 1Q 2024 and what
happened to these loans? How much got refinanced or paid off or were these given modifications and
extensions?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, as I mentioned, over the last 15 months, we've had $2 billion that has reached our reset dates and a fourth
of that has paid off and 75% of that has refinanced. And the performance has been really, really strong. I'm not
going to say that we haven't had any delinquencies. There's probably one or two out there, but it's essentially no
delinquencies to-date on those loans that have reset at current rate levels, and the first quarter performance is
relatively similar, I mean, something that reset in the first quarter hasn't had much time to perform. So I don't want
to speak too hard on that. But the overall characteristics of the first quarter weren't any different than the previous
12 months.

Yeah. So we did have about a little over $1 billion of rating changes. But criticized and classifieds, I'm just taking a
look, a quick look here, so criticized and classifieds increased about $500 million from quarter-to-quarter. That's a
wrong number, I'm sorry. Criticized and classifieds increased about $2 billion from quarter-to-quarter. And those
are two of the ones that we're looking at as we think about how changes in the interest rate curve impact them

increase.

Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. But I wouldn't say that people necessarily got it wrong. It's a confusing math story, in part because the way
we're presenting in this deck is on a fully converted basis for the preferred stock. So the transaction that we did in
March had a good portion of that being preferred. So we have 750 million shares today and on an as converted
basis will be over 1 billion, and we present the details of that in the materials. But that's an expectation that those
shares would convert in the second quarter. And so all of our information has been presented as if those shares
were fully converted throughout the forecast period.

significant gap between where you are today. I'm curious where you see that CRE concentration going by year-

......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So Matthew, obviously, we're not in a position to comment on the $5 billion. So as I indicated, we are close to
being have the option of choosing that transaction. So we'll be working on that over the next 24, 48 hours. As far
as like our process, we really have been, both Craig and I have been here a relatively short period of time, but
going through sitting down with the business owners within the company and trying to understand the business,
we've had numerous meetings to kind of go through, sit down and understand the business and make a
determination, where is it that we have relationships. And so that has really given us the opportunity to kind of
then come back and we're going to put through a process where we'll build our strategic plan for the company,
and we'll be in a position to give you a better identification when we get together for the second quarter after

assets and which are not.

The commercial real estate concentration.

Joseph M. Otting A

I mean, I think the commercial real estate concentration probably, I think, in an ideal world, you're probably
somewhere around 25% to 30%, some type of consumer-related, probably 40% in C&I and probably 30% in your
CRE. We really see the growth potential in the C&I based upon not only my experience but the talent that we will
draw into the company.

of the warrants. They do include an allocation of a portion of the $1 billion capital raise in March to the warrant
classification. But we haven't included anything from an exercise price. So there's potential upside from that.

Matthew Breese Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Okay. And then last one from me is, how much in deposits are at the bank tied to Signature of legacy Specialized
Mortgage Solutions team? And then how sticky important is that business to you going forward?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, I think I'd focus on less on the Signature and more on the mortgage banking aspect. Their business
relationships that are part of either broader business activities or our mortgage model, more so than the Signature
advisor, so to speak. It's roughly about, it varies because they're mortgage escrow related. So some of them
move up and down with principal and interest in the cash flows associated with that. But call it big round numbers,
$3 billion or $4 billion. It's not a big number for us.

Hi, Steve.

Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Maybe just going back to multifamily credit here, I hear you guys with regard to, rates seem to
be influencing your expectation on credit costs. Should we think about the provision primarily being driven by
loans resetting over the next 12 to 18 months? And could that provision therefore be more elevated as we go
through a larger set of resets over the next four to five years if we stay up at a 4% to 5% coupon on the five-year?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, I think we've focused our credit review based on where the market forecasts are from interest rates. I mean,
certainly it could. As I mentioned, we have $4 billion in the whole book that matures and that resets each year

over the next three years. If you get out into 2027, it's about $9 billion. So you've got a bit of a bubble as you sort
of take five years stuff out to 2027. So if you see rates stay this high that long, but I think there's other issues that
with that might foretell further the economy if we see rates that high that long.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And then in terms of just the ability for a number of these borrowers who are in more aggressive structures
to pay, it sounds like you have some expectation of government subsidies, whether it's tax benefits or other
programs. Just kind of curious, how much maybe government programs are influencing your expectations on
credit costs going forward. And one other thing, with regard to the coverage there, just curious as to – well, I'll
stop there with that.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So I'd say that, the government support hasn't really influenced our view on credit risk or reserving. I think what
we're really speaking to more is not the government aspects, but just simply the ownership aspects, what types of
owners, how they've invested, what their historical investment path has been, whether they have significant bases
or small bases, and the potential for tax implications to them if they were to exit versus continue to hold and
support the debt.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. And Steve, the thing I would add there is, the owners of these properties will come in advices that they
have are seeking tax abatement. And we do not put that into our models under NOI until...
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Unless they have it. Until they get it.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, until they get it. And so there have been some recent surprises that they were able to get those completed,
which were very positive for the properties.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steve Moss Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Right. Okay. I appreciate that. And just two more for me in terms of, Craig, you mentioned debt service coverage
on the portfolio one-sixth. But I think when – previous management was disclosing that it was on current payment
terms. Does that debt service coverage ratio on current payment terms or full P&I or even the interest-only loans?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
So the number I gave you was on current payment terms and their existing contractual rates. On full P&I, it's, call
it, 20 basis points lower than that.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Hi, Jon.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, one for each of you. Craig, for you on slide 6, your numbers suggest maybe a modest loss from here
through 2024, maybe breakeven, I don't know. But how should we think about the cadence of earnings in the very
near term? Should we expect a second quarter loss and then profitability to build from there? Are you sending a
different message there?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
No, I think you're seeing the message.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. So all right. That's helpful. And then, Joseph, for you, much bigger picture, any major surprises for you on
the deep dive? And you raised $1 billion, based on what you know now. Is that enough or is it too much given
what you know right?

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 01-May-2024
Joseph M. Otting A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
No, we think it was appropriate when we went through the due diligence process. Initially we had a smaller
number and then it was concluded it needed to be north of $1 billion. So I think that's the right number. When you
look at kind of our CET1, the baseline that where we are today and how that grows, we feel like we have sufficient
liquidity and capital to execute the business plan.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And no real surprises from your point of view?
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Well, I mean, when you say surprises, I wish the regulatory relationships were better at the organization, we have
a lot of work to do and that's on us, that we as an organization in some regards, we're not ready to be regulated
by the OCC. And so we have a lot of catching up to do to get our standards up. But we're committed to doing that
and we've hired the people who understand what that looks like. And I think part of the problem we had before
was, we didn't have people that could visualize the end game or work in a work environment that had that proper
regulatory infrastructure. So I would say that is kind of number one.
Number two, Craig and I grew up where every unit in the bank of significance has their own personal financial
statements. And we do monthly reviews with them and we're constantly forecasting out with those business units
what their business is going to look like over a 12-quarter basis. That doesn't exist in this company. I think
culturally that will change a lot when we get that implemented. That isn't a long term thing. That'll be a relatively
short thing we'll get done. And then we can do a much more accurate job, I think, and influence the performance
of the company by driving that through those businesses.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
It'll make us more nimble.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Joseph M. Otting A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Yeah. And the other thing I would just add to that is, when the infrastructure part of the company can spend
money and the business units aren't being allocated and we need to create a little tension between infrastructure
and the lines where they'll be paying for it, so there's a little bit of pushback and questioning the dollar amount.
That enhances, I think, our financial disciplines.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. All right. Thanks, guys. Good luck with all those.
......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig E. Gifford A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
Thank you.
