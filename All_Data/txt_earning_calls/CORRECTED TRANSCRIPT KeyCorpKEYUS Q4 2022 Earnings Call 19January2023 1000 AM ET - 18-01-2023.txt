MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Good morning and welcome to KeyCorp's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. As a
reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chairman and
CEO, Chris Gorman. Please go ahead.

Christopher M. Gorman
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Well, thank you for joining us for KeyCorp's fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call
today are Don Kimble, our Chief Financial Officer; Clark Khayat, our Chief Strategy Officer. Upon Don's planned
retirement, Clark will assume the CFO role. And also Mark Midkiff, our Chief Risk Officer.
On slide 2, you will find our statement on forward-looking disclosure and non-GAAP financial measures it covers
our presentation materials and comments, as well as the question-and-answer segment of our call.
I am now moving to slide 3. This morning we reported our earnings of $356 million or $0.38 per common share.
Our results included $265 million of provision for credit losses, which exceeded net charge-offs by $224 million or
$0.20 a share. The additional provision builds our allowance for credit losses, adjusting our credit models to
reflect a more cautious economic outlook.

Our results reflect continued growth in both our Consumer and Commercial businesses. In our Consumer
business, we have added new households, with younger clients being our fastest-growing segment. Our
Commercial business also has continued to add and expand relationships.
In 2022, we raised a record level of capital for our clients. Net interest income was up 2% from the third quarter,
reflecting continued relationship-based loan growth supported by stable deposits. Deposit costs continued to
move higher with a step up in deposit rates late in the quarter. At the end of the fourth quarter, nearly 60% of our
deposits were in low-cost retail and escrow balances. In our Commercial businesses, over 80% of our deposits
are from core operating accounts.
Our average loan balances increased 3% from the prior quarter as we continue to add relationships and offer the
best execution with both on and off balance sheet solutions. We continue to benefit from investments we have
made in our business, including the healthcare sector. In 2022, we continue to grow relationships with significant
healthcare providers and expanded our Laurel Road business. Despite the student loan payment holiday, we
originated over $1.5 billion of Laurel Road loans last year and increased our member household by over 30%.
Additionally, we expanded our offering to nurses, added new products and capabilities, and completed the
acquisition of GradFin. Since acquisition, GradFin has held nearly 30,000 individual consultations for refinance
and public service loan forgiveness. These consultations are with prequalified credential prospects all new to Key.
Our fee-based businesses in the fourth quarter reflect the continued slowdown in capital markets activity and the
impact of changes to our NSF/OD fee structure. Investment banking and debt placement fees were up $18 million
from the prior quarter but down meaningfully from the year ago period, reflecting broader capital markets trends.
The new issue equity market is virtually nonexistent, and the M&A market continues to be engaged in price
discovery. Our pipelines remain solid, particularly in M&A. However, the pull-through rates continue to be
adversely impacted by market uncertainty.
We have also continued to see more activity moving on to our balance sheet. In 2022, we raised a record $136
billion of capital for our clients, of which 23% was retained on our balance sheet, well above our long-term
average of 18%. Credit quality remained strong this quarter with net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans
up 14 basis points. Nonperforming loans declined again this quarter, and delinquencies, criticized and classified
loans all remained near historically low levels.
We will continue to support our clients while maintaining our moderate risk profile which positions the company to
perform well through all business cycles. Our capital remains a strength, providing us with sufficient capacity to
support our clients and return capital to our shareholders, including a 5% increase in our common stock dividend
in the fourth quarter.
Before I turn the call over to Don, I want to share some thoughts on our outlook and priorities for 2023 and
beyond. First, we will continue to execute on our differentiated business model and strategy. We will focus on
expanding our presence in our fastest growing markets and targeted industry verticals. As we demonstrated again
in 2022, we are uniquely positioned to support clients through various market conditions.
Secondly, we will continue to benefit from our balance sheet and interest rate positioning. We have been very
deliberate and intentional in the manner in which we have managed our interest rate risk with a longer term
perspective. Although our positioning is providing less current benefit, we have significant upside over the next
two years as swaps and short-term treasuries mature and reprice. If we were to reprice our existing short-term
3

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
treasuries and swaps at today's interest rates, we would have an annualized net interest income benefit of $1.1
billion.
Thirdly, we will maintain our strong credit quality. We've spent the last decade de-risking our portfolio, positioning
the company to outperform through the business cycle. Despite our strong credit metrics we built our loan loss
reserve this quarter, which using our 2023 net charge-off outlook now represents almost five years of coverage.
To put this in perspective, our reserve is now above our CECL day one level, while nonperforming loans and
delinquencies are roughly one half of our pre-pandemic levels.
Finally, we will continue to create capacity to make targeted investments in our business by reducing expenses.
Although expense management has been an ongoing area of focus, we will be accelerating our cost takeout
plans early in 2023. We will pursue cost opportunities across our company, including areas where we can
leverage technology, automation and process improvement to reduce redundancy, improve efficiency and
enhance effectiveness.
Our 2023 targets represent a cost reduction of approximately 4% relative to our full year 2022 level. The
acceleration of our expense reduction plans will benefit us in two ways. First, we cannot grow if we are not
investing. This will give us the capacity to continue to drive our targeted scale strategy, investing in points of
differentiation. With the benefit of our cost reduction plans, we expect to hold expenses relatively stable this year
compared to our full year 2022 results, which would be a significant accomplishment given inflationary pressures
and our commitment to continue to invest in our future.
I am confident in our long-term outlook and our ability to create value for all of our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn
it over to Don to provide more details on the results for the quarter and our 2023 outlook. Don?

Thanks, Chris. I'm now on slide 5. For the fourth quarter, net income from continuing operations was $0.38 per
common share, down $0.17 from the prior quarter and down $0.26 from last year. Our results included $0.20 per
share of additional loan loss provision in excess of net charge-offs as we continue to build our reserves, reflecting
a more cautious economic outlook.
For the full year, we delivered positive operating leverage, marking our ninth time in the last 10 years. This is a
testament to our differentiated and resilient business model and our ongoing focus on disciplined expense
management despite inflationary environment.
Turning to slide 6. Average loans for the quarter were $117.7 billion, up 18% from the year ago period and up 3%
from the prior quarter as we continue to add and deepen client relationships across our franchise. Commercial
loans increased 17% from the year ago quarter, driven by growth in commercial and industrial loans and
commercial real estate balances. Relative to the year ago period, consumer loans increased 22%, reflecting
growth in consumer mortgage and Laurel Road.
Compared with the third quarter of 2022, commercial loans grew 3% and consumer loans were up 2%. Our
commercial growth continues to reflect the strength in our targeted industry verticals and higher line utilization.
Our consumer business continues to benefit from residential real estate originations, which were just under $1
billion for the fourth quarter. Approximately one-third of our originations came from targeted healthcare
professionals.

Continuing onto slide 7, average deposits totaled $145.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022, down 4% from the
year ago period and up $1.4 billion or 1% compared to the prior quarter. Year-over-year, we saw declines in non-
operating commercial deposit balances and retail deposits. The increase in deposit balances from the prior
quarter reflect higher commercial deposits due to seasonality and our focus on maintaining relationship business.
Consumer balances declined in the quarter, driven by inflationary spending and the movement of interest – of rate
sensitive balances. Interest-bearing deposit costs increased 49 basis points from the prior quarter, and our
cumulative deposit beta was 19% since the Fed began raising interest rates in March of 2022.
We continue to view our strong deposit base as a competitive strength, with approximately 60% of our balances
and core consumer and escrow deposits. In addition, over 80% of our commercial deposits were from core
operating accounts.
Turning to slide 8, taxable equivalent net interest income was $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter compared to $1.0
billion in the year ago period and $1.2 billion in the prior quarter. Our net interest margin was 2.73% for the fourth
quarter compared to 2.44% in the same period last year and 2.74% for the prior quarter. Year-over-year, net
interest income and net interest margin benefited from higher earning asset balances and higher interest rate.
Quarter-over-quarter, net interest income and the net interest margin were negatively impacted by higher interest-
bearing deposit costs and a change in the funding mix.
Later in the quarter, we experienced changing market conditions and customer behavior. Market rates increased
more than we expected, and the migration from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing commercial deposits
ticked up. This resulted in a higher deposit beta, lower-than-expected net interest income and net interest margin.
Our outlook for 2023 has our cumulative deposit beta peaking in the mid to high 20% range, well below our
historic levels.
Included in the appendix is additional information on our future net interest income opportunities and asset liability
position. Based on our feedback from our shareholders, we have also included detail on maturities of our interest
rate swaps and short-term treasury security.
As Chris mentioned in his remarks, we've been very intentional in the way we manage interest rate risk with a
long-term perspective. Although, our position has provided less near term benefit, we have significant upside over
the next two years as our swaps and short-term treasuries mature and reprice. We expect this to drive both our
net interest income and our net interest margin higher over the next few years. We believe this is a true
differentiator.
Moving to slide 9, noninterest income was $671 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $909 for the
year ago period and $683 million in the third quarter. The decline in noninterest income from the fourth quarter of
2022 reflects a $151-million decline in investment banking and debt placement fees, along with a $35-million
reduction in other income, primarily from market related gains from the year ago period.
Additionally, service charges on deposits were $19 million lower due to changes in our NSF/OD structure that we
implemented in September, as well as lower consumer mortgage income, down $16 million. Partially offsetting
these declines was an increase in corporate services income, up $13 million due to higher derivatives income.
Relative to the prior quarter, noninterest income declined $12 million.
Service charge on deposit accounts accounted for the majority of the decline, down $21 million, once again
reflecting our new NSF/OD fee terms. Additionally, corporate services income decreased $7 million, driven

primarily from an evaluation adjustment benefit in the prior quarter. And investment banking fees increased $18
million.
I'm now on to slide 10. Total noninterest expense for the quarter was $1.16 billion, down $14 million from the year
ago period and up $50 million from the last quarter. Our expenses reflect our ongoing investments in digital,
analytics and our teammates. Compared to the year ago quarter, we saw declines across most non-personnel
line items, including business services and professional fees, and operating lease expense. Personnel expense
remained flat compared to year ago period, reflecting higher salaries and employee benefits, offset by lower
incentive and stock-based compensation.
Compared to the prior quarter, noninterest expense is up $50 million. Higher non-personnel cost drove most of
the increase. Other expense increased $17 million, reflecting a pension settlement charge in the fourth quarter.
Also, professional fees were higher in the quarter, some of which were temporary in nature. Personnel expense
also increased, reflecting lower deferred costs from slower loan originations.
Moving on to slide 11, overall credit quality remained strong. For the fourth quarter, net charge-offs were $41
million or 14 basis points on average loans, which remained near historic low levels. Nonperforming loans were
$387 million this quarter or 32 basis points of period-end loans, a decline of $3 million from the prior quarter.
Our provision for credit losses was $265 million for the fourth quarter, which exceeded net charge-offs by $224
million. The excess provision increases our allowance from credit losses, reflecting a more cautious model driven
assumption set. For our CECL modeling, we start with Moody's consensus scenario. This quarter, the consensus
estimates reflected a marked slowdown in the economy and meaningful reductions in home prices, both of which
impacted our allowance levels. Despite the increases in the allowance, our outlook for net charge-offs in 2023 are
25 basis points to 30 basis points, remains well below our through-the-cycle loss levels of 40 basis points to 60
basis points.
Now on to slide 12. We ended the fourth quarter with Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.1%, within our targeted
range of 9% to 9.5%. This provides us with sufficient capacity to continue to support our customers and their
borrowing needs and to return capital to our shareholders. We will continue to manage our capital consistent with
our capital priorities but, first, supporting organic growth in our business; second, paying dividend. In the fourth
quarter, our board of directors approved a 5% increase, which now places our dividend at $0.205 per common
share per quarter. And finally, repurchasing shares. Our current share repurchase authorization of $790 million is
in place through the third quarter of 2023. We did not complete any share repurchases in the fourth quarter.
On slide 13 is our full year 2023 outlook. The guidance is relative to our full year 2022 results. Importantly, using
the midpoint of our guidance ranges with result in another year of positive operating leverage in 2023, we expect
average loans will be up between 6% and 9% and average deposits will be flat to down 2%. Net interest income is
expected to be up between 6% and 9%, reflecting growth in average loan balances and higher interest rates.
Our guidance is based on the forward curve assuming a Fed funds rate peaking at 5% in the first quarter and
starting to decline in the fourth quarter. These interest rate assumptions, along with our expectations for customer
behavior and competitive pricing environment, are very fluid and will continue to impact our outlook prospectively.
Noninterest income is expected to be down 1% to 3%, reflecting the implementation of our new NSF/OD fee
structure last year and continued challenging capital markets activities, at least, for the first half of the year. We
expect noninterest expense to be relatively stable with the benefit of the cost takeout opportunities Chris
described in his remarks, along with ongoing investments that we will make in our business.

For the year, we expect credit quality to remain strong and net charge-offs will be in the 25-basis point to 30-basis
point range, well below to the through-the-cycle range of 40 basis points to 60 basis points. Our guidance for our
GAAP tax rate is approximately 19% to 20%.
Finally, shown at the bottom of our slide are our long-term targets, which remain unchanged. We expect to
continue to make progress on these targets by maintaining our moderate risk profile and improving our
productivity and efficiency, which will drive returns. Overall, it was a solid quarter and a very good finish to another
successful year for Key. We remain confident in our ability to grow and deliver on each of our long-term targets.
With that, I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator?

I know you mentioned that you saw a step up in deposit rates late in the fourth quarter. I wonder if you could give
us a little more detail of what products and the magnitude that you saw, maybe your – how you see that following
through? And then related to that, you also said that higher than expected pressure on deposit cost as well, not
just a step up but a greater than expected amount of pressure. And just trying to get a feel on around what area
surprised you and why do you think given the outlook around deposit pressures and rates, what was – what
attributed to the surprise there? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial & Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Sure can, John. And as far as late in the quarter and late November, December, we started to see a different
migration pattern as far as some of the deposits and the rates. We saw market conditions start to pick up as far as
rates and many products. Our expectation coming into the quarter was continuing to drift up some of the money
market rates on deposits but the customers were migrating more towards time deposits, which had a higher
incremental cost than what our assumptions were as far as money market deposit accounts.

We also saw a shift away from noninterest-bearing account at a faster pace than what we would have expected
late in the quarter. And so, both of those had an impact of driving net interest income down for the current quarter
compared to what we would have expected even coming into the end of the quarter, and it's also reflected in our
outlook going forward. And, Clark, I don't know if you want to offer up any thoughts as far as trends going forward,
as far as the deposit rates, and betas, and what have you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Strategy Officer & Executive Vice President, KeyCorp
Sure. Thanks, Don. A little bit more – just to get to your question, John, a little more pressure on the commercial
side than the consumer side which would not be unexpected. We did see, as Don mentioned, a rotation out of
non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing, and we saw the ending balance of noninterest-bearing around 29%.
That's a little bit of seasonality and we've seen that come back. That's a ratio kind of high 20s that we would
expect through the year, and that's a little bit better than where we've been historically, which would have been
sort of mid-20s.
In terms of the products and rates, as Don said, CDs coming through. We'd expect the betas for the year to be
mid to high-20s, as Don said in his prepared remarks. And, again, a little bit more movement to CDs than money
markets that we expected, but we've factored that in. And, again, that's sort of stable high-20s noninterest-bearing
ratio for the year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
John, it's Chris. It's interesting. Customer behavior is really hard to model. We wouldn't have expected that the
cumulative beta for the first three quarters would have ever been as low as 9%. And as we got to the end of the
year, it really accelerated. And a lot of it was on the commercial side. A lot of it were excess deposits in places
like our private banking area. So, it's been interesting. This has been the steepest rate of increases in the Fed's
history, and I think some of the conventional curves are sort of out the window.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore Group LLC
Okay. Thanks, Chris. That helps. And then I know you mentioned the need for investment in the year. You're
focusing on ratcheting up investments in certain areas. So, I just want to see if you can give us additional color on
what changed there in terms of areas that you're investing in that necessitated a greater pull back in costs
elsewhere. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. So, it's really a continuation of the investments, John, that we've been making. And the point I was making
there was we're not going to cease to invest as we take out costs. And when we were at Investor Day a year ago,
we talked about growing our consumers by 20% by 2025, focusing really on our growth markets. And we're
having a lot of success with our younger customers and we're going to continue to focus on both products and
marketing in that regard.
Also, we talked about hiring bankers. We talked about we think we had these unique platforms that are
underleveraged, and we talked about increasing our banker population by 25% by 2025. Admittedly, last year, we
tapered off in the back half of the year. The market was obviously overheated and also, frankly, we saw the
8

downturn coming in the economy. We think it will be a very good environment to recruit and successfully bring
people onto the platform going forward.
And then, lastly was Laurel Road and the commitment we made around Laurel Road where we've continued to
invest is that we were going to grow our members from 50,000 to 250,000. This year, we successfully grew by
30%, and we've made a lot of investments expanding to nurses, having a full product line there, buying GradFin,
being a leader in public service loan forgiveness, and we're also going to get into the income-based forgiveness
game as well.
So, those are the three areas. And so, it wasn't really new investments so much. It's a continuation of the
investments we've made in critical areas of the business, including around things like continuing to migrate to the
cloud and investing in digital.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey, good morning. Can you give us some more color on the reserve build this quarter? To your point, your NCO
guide for 2023 is well below your long-term target. So, I guess, what changed in the macro environment that
necessitated the reserve build? And, I guess, is this you being a lot more conservative? And should we expect the
reserve ratio to stabilize from here? Or could there be factors that drive that reserve ratio higher?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure, Manan. First of all, thank you for your question. And you're right. Despite the fact that we have really good
credit metrics, we did in fact build the reserve. And so, if you kind of step back for a second, kind of look at the
macro perspective, we believe the economy is clearly slowing. We think the probability of a recession has
increased from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of last year. Our base case by the way is that there will be a
mild recession.
There is really three drivers of the CECL reserve. The first is the macro view which I just described, which is the
driver for us. The second is loan growth and we actually have some loan growth. The third is really idiosyncratic
risks, specific portfolio, specific credit. That is not driving our reserve build at all.
So, just to kind of bring it to life for you. From the third to the fourth quarter, as we look at our model, we looked at
GDP declining by about two-thirds from sort of 1.3% to 0.4%. Unemployment going from say – in the third quarter,
we thought it would peak at 4.1%. We now think it will peak around 5%. But significantly when we look at things
like home price index, in the third quarter, we thought homes were going up by 1.3%. In the fourth quarter as we
modeled it, it was a decline of 4.6%. So, fairly significant quarter-over-quarter change of 5.9%.

Now, to bring it back to kind of our portfolio. We, for example, have $21 billion of mortgages. That's about 18% of
our loan book. Booking about – the FICO scores on those are say 761 from memory or some such number. We
also say that 40% of our mortgages are 800 or above, and I share this texture for you because we are not worried
about our mortgage book. But as we drive our CECL models, which are forward-looking, the macro drivers have
significant impact. And I'm just using that as an example for why the reserve build. Does that answer your
question?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah, that's really helpful. Thanks so much for the color. And then, if you could just round that out with how you're
thinking about the NIM and just managing the NIM as you go to 2023. Earlier on, you were in the camp of the
Feds keeping rates higher for longer. Has that changed and has that changed how you're managing – you're
putting on any additional swaps or hedges on the books?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial & Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. As far as how we're managing it right now, our assumption set is basically that we would just continue at
this point in time to replace roll-off of swaps that we have. We're continuing to evaluate that. I think the challenge
that we all have is just with this inverted yield curve is when do you pull the trigger to start to lock in some of that
rollover risk and outlook. And so right now, we've not embedded any of that into our base assumptions, but that –
it's something that we'll continue to have as optionality to take care of that in the future.

Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
I guess, just wanted to follow up on credit. So, you talked about the consumer book and the FICO's. When we
look at the commercial book both on the C&I, CRE, just talk to us about the idiosyncratic risks. I mean, the
leverage lending book you provide on slide 15 is relatively small. But when we think about the impact from higher
rates pulling demand and you talked about mild recession as your base case, like where within the CRE and the
C&I portfolios do you expect delinquencies to start moving higher and where is the loss content?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. Well, Ebrahim, thanks for the question. So, you started at the right place where we focus. We focus any
place where there is leverage and obviously if you think about leverage finance, which by the way for us is only
about 2.5% of an entire loan book and it's focused in our seven industry verticals and it has a pretty high turnover.
But you're exactly right. Where there is leverage and you go into a mild recession and you have declining
EBITDA, you have to watch that very closely. We feel good about that portfolio. Nothing has bubbled up to the
surface. But as you can imagine, we're modeling it very, very regularly.
The next area that you mentioned which I think is really appropriate is real estate, and real estate is an area that
we look at closely. What we've done with our real estate business is we completely rebuilt it around a business
that's not – we now have put real estate loans on our books, but we also distribute a lot of paper. So, it's a little bit
of a different business than a lot of our competitors have Fannie, Freddie, FHA, the like companies, the CMBS
market, etcetera. So, we distribute a lot of risks.
We're also focused on – very specifically on certain asset classes. And the certain asset classes that we're
focused on first and foremost, multifamily in its broadest sense, but within multifamily on affordable housing.
We're watching those closely. So far, the rent uptakes are good. The rents are still holding firm. So, we feel really
good about that portfolio.
The portfolio that we look at very closely and fortunately we have very little of it, there's actually two portfolios, the
first is B and C class office space in central business districts. Right now, we're down to $250 million, but we're
watching that very closely because those buildings are multitenant buildings. And the reality is whether it's key
cutting expenses and getting rid of occupancy cost or any other business, I think that's a real risk going forward.
So, we're watching that closely.
The other area where we only have about $1 billion of exposure is in the retail, and retail is an area where we
keep a close eye. So, that's kind of how we're thinking about it. And as you can imagine, we are continually
modeling this portfolio as we look at that delta between where they're borrowing and where their debt rolls over.

There hasn't been – there really hasn't been a lot of movement yet. I think people were still – just like in the M&A
environment, I think people are in price discovery. Obviously, if you take my example of B and C class office,
there's a lot of people that have impaired equity. But I think people are going to have to frankly endure some more
pain before there's a meeting of the minds on kind of how to restructure, how to bring in fresh equity, etcetera.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Got it. And just one question, Don, on NII, do you think the mid to high-20s beta is conservative enough? I'm just
wondering, in a world of 5% plus Fed funds, QT, like a lot of banks are kind of nudging their expectations a bit
higher. Do you think that sets you up for more downside risk over the next few quarters? Just give us a sense of
your comfort level with that beta guidance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial & Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
I'll go ahead and offer some thoughts, and then ask Clark to go ahead and chime in as well. But I would say that
keep in mind that, as Chris mentioned earlier, we really were kind of best-in-class for the first few quarters of this
rate increase cycle that our cumulative deposit beta is at 19%. Most of the peers I'm seeing are closer to the 30%
already. We did do a thorough scrub as to where we see rate is going.
And I think what you're seeing and why we have confidence in our deposit beta assumptions is the fact that we
have shifted our priority and focus over to more primacy, both on the commercial and consumer side. And we
think that will continue to pay dividend for it as far as keeping our overall deposit costs down. Clark, anything you
would add there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Strategy Officer & Executive Vice President, KeyCorp
Yeah. The other point I would add is just that it's less for us about new deposit acquisition. We're always going to
acquire deposits from new clients and new relationships. But a lot of what we're looking at this year is managing
clients from product to product, and that just allows us a little bit more flexibility on pricing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Ebrahim, the only thing I would add, I agree with everything that Don and Clark said. The thing that I will share
with you though, this is sort of uncharted territory and while we're really pleased with the trajectory of our deposit
betas, we're not going to win the deposit battle – deposit beta battle and lose the – win the beta battle and lose
the deposit more because it's very important that we serve our clients and we keep them here at Key.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey. Good morning, everyone.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Good morning Steve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial & Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I wanted to start on the loan outlook. If I look at where period end and average loans end in 2022, it appears that
you're not looking for much loan growth in 2023 on a period end basis. Can you confirm that and maybe give
some color on why such a sluggish outlook? I don't know if you're tightening your credit box or whatnot.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial & Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Steve, this is Don. And as far as the outlook, the period end balance sometimes can be a little misleading. So, if
you just take a look at the fourth quarter average for total loans at $117.5 billion, our midpoint of our guidance
range is in the $120-million range. And all of that really is coming from commercial. And so, with this change in
our economic outlook that also influenced our – or determined what our allowance was, we've also pulled back on
some of those loan growth outlook.
We also see, Steve, that our consumer loan balances are flat throughout next year. And what – our expectation
there is that we'll continue to have residential mortgage origination, that we'll continue to see some of the home-
equity balances trade down and relatively flat on other consumer categories. And so, it is very modest incremental
growth from here, but we think it's appropriate given the backdrop of the economic outlook we have.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Okay, Don, that's helpful. And then on the reserve build, if the reserve build was a change in the economic
assumptions and not idiosyncratic risk, why did the specific reserve not go up materially in some of these
consumer categories? I know they're smaller, but home equity, consumer direct card, I would have thought if
you'd changed your unemployment rate etcetera, we would have seen an increase in those as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial & Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
One of the biggest things that Chris talked about were that the larger moves were the GDP coming down and also
the home price index. And so what you would have seen is the residential real estate back credits having a larger
increase than some of the others. You also factor in the position that our delinquency levels and our credit size
and class 5 levels are still very benign. And I think that's why you're not seeing some of those other "higher risk"
category showing increased reserves because we're not seeing the migration of those portfolios at this point in
time.

Got it, okay. Thanks a lot. If I could squeeze one more. And just looking at the NII guidance, you have 6% to 9%. I
know you said mid to high 20% range for deposit beta, but what is the assumption? Is it mid or high that's
underlying this guidance range? And what are you assuming the mix of noninterest-bearing is by the end of
2023? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Strategy Officer & Executive Vice President, KeyCorp
Yeah. Hey, Steve. It's Clark. So, the mid to high question is sort of mid to high, 27-ish, 28% area for the year on
the beta. And then the noninterest-bearing percentage is 29%, roughly high 20s for the year.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
Don, I think you mentioned in your remarks that there wasn't any share repurchases completed in the fourth
quarter. Maybe, Chris or Don, what's the outlook for stock buybacks? I may have missed your comment that you
gave it, but what's the outlook for stock repurchases in 2023?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Gerard, we're not assuming that there's going to be any meaningful stock repurchases. As we look at our balance
sheet and supporting our clients and we look at our second priority, which is paying our dividend, I just don't see
us out there repurchasing a lot of shares based on our current modeling.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then you talked a lot about what went on with the deposit betas and the mix of deposits in the
quarter. Obviously, your peers had similar comments and the difference that we saw with Key was that the margin
was essentially flat where others went up. How much of the borrowings – I noticed in your average balance sheet
that you included in the press release, your short-term borrowings and long-term borrowings have gone up and
they are much more expensive of course than deposit funding. Can you share with us your thinking on how you're
using those and why they have been going up?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial & Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Gerard, as far as the funding, what we've seen is that the loan growth throughout the second half of the year
especially exceeded deposit growth, and so we were using FHLB and some other issuances to help address the
funding needs. I would say that our loan growth outlook and our deposit outlook wouldn't suggest a continuation
at the same pace as far as building that other funding sources. And so, we wouldn't expect to see that same type
of a growth rate going forward. But near term, we work fine with that. I would say traditionally we would look at a
loan to deposit ratio in the 90% to 95% range and we're still below that, and so we've got plenty of capacity to
continue to leverage that funding source as needed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking the call. Don, with regard to the $1.1 billion of NII repricing
benefits to which you guys alluded, I was wondering if you could just sort of walk through the trajectory of when
and how those kick in. I mean, I see the repricing numbers in the appendix, which is very helpful, but just would
be curious to hear kind of more vocally how you think about it.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
Maybe put it another way or I wonder if there is an easy frame of reference, what would first quarter 2023 NII look
like versus say fourth quarter 2023 or first quarter 2024? I'm not looking for specific numbers, but is there an easy
way to say, hey, we sort of troughed here and then start to accelerate meaningfully off of here and if there's a
timeframe around that, something like that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial & Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Good. And I will offer up a couple of quick comments but turn it over to Clark, because Clark could be the one
that's here to deal with that going forward and I won't be around. So, we'll go ahead and pass the baton from that
perspective.
One thing I want to highlight though, Scott, is that we take a look – for example, you mentioned the first quarter of
2023. Keep in mind, there are some things that impact the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter that are more
seasonal. Day count related issues cost about $20 million from where the fourth quarter is to the first quarter. We
also typically see fee income drop from the fourth quarter to first quarter given some of the refinance activity on
the loan side.
And so, we would see the first quarter traditionally being the low point for both our net interest income and net
interest margin, and we'd expect to see growth from there. And Clark has been spending a lot of time taking a
look at strategies as far as the swaps and treasury. So, Clark, why don't you take it from there as far as other
insights?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Strategy Officer & Executive Vice President, KeyCorp
Sure. Just to try to address your question directly Scott, I think, really the majority of the value is going to come in
2024. If you think about what's coming off in swaps and treasuries in 2023, that number is about $7 billion to $7.5
billion. It's more like $15 billion and $24 billion, so think about that kind of two-thirds, one-third almost ratio.
I'd say of the number we've shared, which is again just to remind you kind of taking all $29 billion of swaps and $9
billion of treasuries and spot pricing them. Again, I think you'd see about a third of that benefit in the 2023 exit run
rate. So, the beginnings of some steepness in that NIM and then more of that pulling through with 2024 as you'd
see – again, the majority of that maybe two-thirds or three quarters of that value started to come through by the
end of 2024.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay, perfect, thank you. And I guess out of curiosity, I'm a little surprised at how well the estimate kind of held in,
$1.1 billion versus I think you're saying $1.2 billion last quarter just given all that changes in the way the curve has
behaved. What does it take to really move that number one way or another? Is that the sort of a $1 billion plus
kind of a pretty sturdy number almost regardless of the way things behave?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Strategy Officer & Executive Vice President, KeyCorp
Yeah. I'd say the biggest impact there is the movement in the two-year end of the curve, and what we saw was
the longer end rates moved a lot more significantly than to your point.

Hey. Good morning, Mike.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey. You guys see financing to wholesale companies from both the lending side and the capital market side. And
one topic during this earnings season is the capital market conditions are a lot tougher, whereas the lending
conditions are not that much tougher. So, when do you think this will converge? In other words, the pricing in cap
market is much more difficult than the pricing in the lending markets. Are you seeing any firming up or not?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
So, the answer is, Mike, it depends. And when I say it depends, it depends on kind of what the customer strata is.
So, 50% of our loans are to investment grade customers and the adjustments there are immediate. There is a
bunch of different inputs where the people are hedging, putting a swap on. There is multiple people looking at it,
etcetera.
Where there is a disconnect and I don't really think the disconnect goes away is in those kind of quality middle-
market companies that one bank or one fund can finance. And I don't think we've seen – not I don't think, we
haven't seen the adjustment there that you would expect.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And do you expect that to change coming up? And just your general outlook on capital markets that – a
nice tailwind at times, recently it's been a headwind.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. So I think, look, ultimately things get repriced and it takes time whether you're talking about bank debt going
into the middle market or you're talking about people doing major strategic acquisitions. My experience is it takes
17

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
literally over a year for people to kind of readjust their expectations. And so, we're obviously easily six months into
this. But I think the first half in capital markets is going to be challenging because people still remember what the
business or the financing was worth, say, six or eight or nine months ago, but eventually – and by the way,
anyone that's a buyer is acutely aware of how things have been repriced.
But those will converge, and I think it's going to be – I think it'll be challenging in the first half of the year, Mike.
And I think this big pent-up backlog will start to kind of – as people go through price discovery will start to clear out
in the second half of the year.

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey. Good morning and, Don, best of wishes as well from me. I just have to come back and just super clarify,
Don, the 27%, 28% beta for cumulative that is interest-bearing that compares to the 19% through three quarters?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial & Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Absolutely yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay, cool. And then so just – I guess the comparison question that I think continues to come up is just that many
peers are talking mid-30s, even low 40s in some of the calls that we've heard so far. So, can you just kind of go
one step deeper into the type of pricing assumptions and, I guess, within products and businesses that just gives
you that much better relative confidence to peers? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Strategy Officer & Executive Vice President, KeyCorp
Sure. Ken, it's Clark. So, I'll pick that up. Again, for us, what we saw in the fourth quarter and what we're looking
at in 2023 is much less about new to Key deposits where those kind of new business rates are much higher and
necessarily have to be higher to bring them in versus motion in the book of noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing
or from different account to different account where we can manage that transition a little more comfortably. And
given that, what we are avoiding we think in large parts is the significant marginal cost of funds that the new price
or new offer dollar requires in repricing the larger book.

The only other thing I would add, Ken, is that right now we're at 19% cumulative, I think most of our peers are
close to 30%. And so by them going to 40% is the same thing as us going to high 20s. So, the incremental
change from this point forward is probably fairly consistent, it's just that we're at a better starting point from peers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah, that makes sense. It does seem like though to get to that point, your incremental interest-bearing deposits
costs have to be – the betas have to be lower than the 33% in the fourth quarter just square to that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial & Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
As far as the cumulative, probably not because you only got a 50-basis point increase going forward as far as the
rates in 2023. But we can go back and reverse engineer the math, but I think it still lines up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay, then just one quick one. Laurel Road origination outlook, can you give us your updated thoughts there?
Thanks, guys.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure, Ken. So, Laurel Road obviously from a straight origination outlook perspective has been challenged. It's
been challenged really by three things. One is the federal loan student payment holiday, that's a challenge, I think
that's been extended several times. The next is just the rising interest rates which are a challenge. And the third
challenge that we have there is all the discussion around student loan debt forgiveness, obviously, I think has
some borrowers wanting to stay on the side lines to preserve optionality. Having said all of that, I was impressed
that we were able to originate last year $1.5 billion of refinance loans.
But even a bigger picture, Ken, is we are trying to create a national digital affinity bank. So, first of all, those
originations will come back and they will come back when there is clarity around all the issues I just talked about.
And there is a bunch of raw material being priced right now that you'll be able to refinance advantageously. But in
the meantime, what we've done is build this national digital affinity bank that has a full suite of products for
doctors, a whole suite of products for nurses. We're getting a 30% cross-sell on the business that we do.
So, there is no question that originations have been challenged and they'll continue to be challenged in the very
near term, but what we're trying to do there is a lot broader. This GradFin business that we bought is really
interesting because they're the leader in public service loan forgiveness. And where you're going to see a lot of
discussion going forward is around this income based repayments and we're kind of uniquely qualified to be in
there advising on that. Anytime we advise people, obviously, we're [indiscernible] (00:52:35) them on as full
customers. So, does that answer your question?

Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. Sorry if I missed it, but what part of the yield curve are we more concerned about as we think
about your fixed rate assets lowering? And I realized it might be a variety of kind of products from the short-term,
from the longer term. But as we think about it, I think that $1.1 billion you said, what part of the yield curve should
we watch with obviously longer rates coming in but shorter rates staying high?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Donald R. Kimble A
Chief Financial & Administrative Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. Matt, as far as the $1.1 billion, it's really at two to three-year end of the curve and that's where we would be
looking to extend those swaps when we're in a position to do that. And so it is in that portion of the yield curve.
Beyond that, we also have a little over $1 billion a quarter and rollover our bond portfolio, and then we tend to look
at some of them around the five-year end of the curve there. And we tend to do more CMO structures and shorter
pass-through like 15-year type pass-through assets as far as our normal investment strategy there.

Sure. The largest decline for us will be in the deposit service charges category. We mentioned that this quarter
was the first quarter of the implementation of the NSF/OD fee. There's about another $70 million impact in 2023
compared to 2022 for that. And our outlook right now also would suggest that we think that our corporate services
income will be down year-over-year just because we've had such a strong program this year as far as derivatives,
interest rate swaps and what have you for customers. And we think that with less rate volatility, there will be less
opportunity there for that category. That's the blended impact as to how we get to that down 1% to 3%.

Got it. And then the loan to deposit ratio is now at 85%, is there a certain level that you don't want to go above?
And secondly, I'm assuming that you're going to continue to let securities cash flows and use those to kind of help
support loan growth.

We typically would target between 90% and 95%, it's been a long time since we have been up to that level. But
that's where we think our balance sheet is still very efficient and access to the capital markets for that national
funding sources is available and supports that. As the second part of the question, I apologize. Peter, remind me.

Sure, just using securities cash flow.

I apologize, yes. What we've talked about a lot is that we got that $9 billion of short-term treasuries that start to
mature later in 2023 and throughout 2024. That can be a very good source of liquidity for us. And we're really
indifferent whether that replaces funding or whether we roll that over into new securities. But if you look at the rest
of the portfolio, it's about $40 billion and we think that's a good core size. We can let runoff their fund, some of the
liquidity needs on a short-term basis. But longer term, we think that that's probably a good relative size for the
portfolio given our overall liquidity management position.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 19-Jan-2023
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Peter, the other thing I would add to that, as you think about the puts and takes on the balance sheet is that in the
fourth quarter, for example, we put 24% of the capital that we raised, which was $33 billion, on our balance sheet.
Historically, that number has been 18%. So, with the dislocation in all the capital markets, we're able to structure
things in a manner that we want and put them on our balance sheet as these capital markets work their way out.
That won't – it will basically start deviating back to kind of 18-type-percent as opposed to 24%. That's just a little
bit of a different wrinkle that I think is pretty, as I said, short-term over the next half year or so.
