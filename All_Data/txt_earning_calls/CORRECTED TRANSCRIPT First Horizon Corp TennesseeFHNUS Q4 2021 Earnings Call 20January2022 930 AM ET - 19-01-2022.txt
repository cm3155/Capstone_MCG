And now, I'll hand it over to Bryan.

D. Bryan Jordan
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Thank you, Ellen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll start on slide 5. While 2021 proved to
be an interesting year for the US economy and the banking industry as a whole, I'm very proud of the resilience of
the First Horizon team and the continued progress and results that we delivered, once again, highlighting the
benefit of our business model.
The team remains strongly focused on understanding and anticipating the needs and prospects and clients alike
in order to deliver value-added advice and services across an increasingly competitive landscape. Our Specialty
businesses and higher growth markets helped to drive the momentum in the second half of the year and coupled
with funding discipline, a focus on expenses and improving credit quality resulted in EPS of $0.48 per share in the
fourth quarter and an adjusted return on tangible common equity of 17.5%.
For the full year, adjusted EPS was $2.07, up $0.85 over 2020, driven by the benefit of the IBERIABANK merger.
While pressure on short-term rates continued and the competitive landscape amplified, our client focus value
proposition with a broader product set continued to provide a point of differentiation and generate better than
expected results.
Strong focus on deposit pricing helped drive net interest income up 1% despite a $5 million reduction in net
merger accretion and Paycheck Protection Program benefits. Core NII was up 3% with commercial loan growth
up 2%, excluding the impact of the PPP portfolio. We continue to see momentum in our commercial business and
ended the quarter with unfunded commitments up 8% to just over $20 billion.
Our focus on reducing our deposit costs has really paid off. In the fourth quarter, our interest-bearing deposit cost
declined 6 basis points and declined 18 basis points from year-end 2020. As many of you know, we are
extraordinarily well-positioned to benefit in a rising rate environment and a strengthening economy. We ended the
quarter with our interest rate sensitivity profile of a 16% increase in net interest income to a 100 basis point rate
shock across the yield curve.
As expected, we continue to see further moderation of fixed income and mortgage banking fees, given both the
impact of higher long-term rate and seasonality as well as additional pressure from our recent reduction in NSF
OD pricing. Expense control is an area of focus, and expenses were down 1% despite a $3 million increase tied
to special bonuses we paid to our frontline associates, primarily designed to reward associates who have served
clients continuously during the pandemic throughout our banking and our call centers.
Our asset quality trends continued to show strong performance highlighted by net charge-offs of only 1 basis point
and a 21% decrease in non-performing loans. The stabilizing economic outlook and overall credit quality
improvement drove another robust reserve release with provision credit of $65 million in the quarter. Our capital
levels remained strong with a CET1 ratio of nearly 10%. And given the lower growth environment, we increased
our return of capital to shareholders including the repurchase of 9 million common shares in the quarter in a total
of 24 million shares repurchased for the year.

This drove a year-over-year decrease of 4% in our share count. Despite the impact of dividends and buybacks,
tangible book value per share of $11 was up 1% in the quarter and 8% for the full year. We have made
substantial progress towards our upcoming systems conversion in February, including additional mock
conversions, further upgrades to online banking platforms and finalizing client communications.
We believe the planning and focus on investments in technology, products and people positions us well to
capitalize further on the power of the combined platform into 2022 and beyond. As of the fourth quarter, we have
identified approximately $45 million in revenue synergies related to the merger. We remain confident in our ability
to deliver at least $200 million in net annualized cost savings by the fourth quarter of this year.
As the world continues to deal with the impact of COVID and variants, I'm very optimistic about the continued
macroeconomic recovery and the momentum and strength of our combined organization is providing towards our
commitment to delivering top quartile returns. I am very grateful for the dedication and hard work of our
associates, as they continue to navigate the various impacts of the pandemic and at the same time deliver value
for all of our constituents, clients, communities and shareholders.
I'm also pleased to introduce our new CFO, Hope Dmuchowski. While she joined our team less than two months
ago, she has already added tremendous value. I'm confident that her expertise, forward thinking passion for
change and commitment to excellence will be instrumental in helping to drive continuous improvement.
With that, let me turn it over to Hope to take the call from here. Welcome.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Thank you, Bryan. Good morning to you all. I am excited to be with you today. I'd like to start off by saying I'm
deeply honored to serve this company and our shareholders as the Chief Financial Officer. I'm grateful to
everyone that has encouraged, supported, and believed in me all along the way. I could not have asked for a
warmer welcome from the First Horizon team. I'm so thankful for the incredible foundation they have provided me,
and I'm excited about the future of our company.
Now, starting on slide 6, which provides the highlights of the quarter, some of which Bryan has already covered.
Overall, our results reflect a solid quarter, with improvement in core net interest income and continued strength in
credit quality and capital return. As we look toward the upcoming systems conversion in February and our
trajectory in the coming year, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the strength of the combined
organization, particularly given our higher growth footprint and our highly asset-sensitive balance sheet in light of
accelerating improvements in the economy.
Turning to slide 7, we outlined the notable items in the quarter, which reduced our results about $41 million after
tax or $0.08 per share. In addition to net merger related notable items of $35 million, we recorded a $3 million
non-cash charge on retirement of the remaining legacy IBERIABANK's trust preferred securities; $6 million of
deferred compensation costs resulting from litigation tied to a company that was fully divested more than 10 years
ago; $10 million tied to derivative valuation adjustments related to prior Visa Class-B share sales. This was
triggered by the fact triggered by the fact that these have funded additional escrow balances related to their
litigation prior to year-end.
Turning to slide 8, we provide highlights on our adjusted financials and key performance metrics for the quarter.
We generated better-than-expected PPNR of $274 million, as solid improvement in net interest income was
driven by lower funding costs, higher other interest earning assets and commercial loan growth excluding PPP.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
This helped to mitigate expected declines in fee income, driven by the impact of higher long-term rates and
seasonality.
Adjusted expenses of $474 million was in line with expectations, which included the impact of a special bonus for
employees of $3 million. The stabilizing economic outlook and continued improvement in asset quality led to
provision for credit of $65 million this quarter, which was down from the $85 million credit last quarter. This
reduction drove a $0.03 decline in earnings per share. Adjusted ROTCE was 17.5% and adjusted ROTCE before
the impact of the provision credit was 14%. Tangible book value per share came in at about $11, up 1% as GAAP
net income was largely offset by a $0.24 impact tied to return of capital and an $0.08 decline tied to the mark-to-
market impact on the securities portfolio.
Turning to slide 9, we are really pleased to report that our fully taxable equivalent NII was up $7 million linked
quarter, despite a $5 million reduction in net merger accretion and PPP revenue. Our strong focus on reducing
interest-bearing deposit costs through disciplined pricing benefited NII in the quarter by over $6 million. As a
result, core NII was up $12 million or 3% reflecting improvements tied to lower funding costs, as well as growth in
commercial loans and other interest-earning assets, which more than offset the impact of spread tightening in the
quarter.
During the quarter, we continue to put additional excess cash to work with security purchases of an incremental
$700 million at a yield of approximately 1.7%. We ended the quarter with excess cash of $14.1 million and our
securities to interest-earning assets totaled 11%. As the rate environment changes, we will continue to reevaluate
opportunities to redeploy excess cash and manage our overall asset sensitivity prudently. The net interest margin
was up 1 basis point linked quarter and stable on a core basis. We lowered our interest-bearing deposit costs by
6 basis points, which helped drive a 4-basis-point benefit to the margin from total deposit costs.
Turning to slide 10, as we anticipated, headline fee income was down around 8% in the quarter, driven by
expected declines in fixed income and mortgage banking. Fixed income fees remained relatively resilient and
were down in line with expectations. Average daily revenue came in at $1.1 million, compared with $1.3 million
last quarter and resulted in a full year average of $1.4 million.
Service charges and fees were stable, despite a modest decrease related to our recent NSF pricing changes,
which was partially offset by higher volumes. Mortgage banking and title fees were down $6 million as the impact
of lower secondary origination volumes was partially offset by higher gain on sale margins in the quarter. We
continue to shift more of our production on balance sheet. Card and digital banking fees were down $2 million,
driven by a $4 million decrease tied to a revenue sharing adjustment which more than offset the benefit of
seasonally higher transaction volumes in the quarter. Other non-interest income increased $4 million, largely
reflecting higher SBA servicing income in the quarter.
Turning to slide 11. Let's review our expense trends. Adjusted expenses of $474 million was down $6 million in
the quarter, driven by a $12 million decrease in personnel. The decrease was driven by lower incentives and
commissions, largely tied to reductions in fixed income and mortgage banking fees. These results were partially
offset by the $3 million impact of a special bonus to our frontline associates, which Bryan mentioned earlier.
Personnel costs also reflected lower salaries and benefits, reflecting merger saves and lower 401(k) costs, which
were partially offset by increase in FICA taxes from unusually low third quarter levels. Outside services remain
stable. The slight increase was primarily from branding initiatives and advertising related to the upcoming
conversion. Our non-interest expense increased $4 million, driven by a DDA product reward accrual catch up, as
well as higher travel and entertainment expenses, as well as an increase FDIC cost.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
On slide 12 and 13, we covered loan and deposit growth. Our efforts to broaden their reach and market
penetration across our footprint helped generate another quarter of underlying momentum in loan growth.
Average PPP loans were down $1.5 billion in the quarter, with forgiveness coming in faster than we originally
expected. As Bryan mentioned, annualized loan growth before the impact of PPP loans was 5%, driven by linked
quarter commercial loan growth of 2%. On a period-end basis, we generate 2% loan growth before the impact of
PPP and loans to mortgage companies. This was driven by a 5% increase in other C&I.
We continue to see great traction in our Specialty businesses, particularly equipment finance, asset-based
lending, franchise finance, and correspondence, as well as growth in our markets such as Florida, Tennessee,
and our mid-Atlantic region. These results have been muted some by reductions in commercial real estate, given
high levels of refinancing activity in the capital markets as well as lower balances in the energy portfolio.
Deposits continue to drive our balance sheet growth again this quarter with $1.8 billion increase in average DDA
or 7%, which continued to further improve the deposit mix. I mentioned the success and benefit of driving down
our interest-bearing deposit costs which were reduced by 6 basis points to 11 basis points in the quarter that also
reduced total funding costs by 5 basis points.
Turning to slide 14, I'll cover asset quality and reserves. Credit quality continues to be strong with exceptionally
low levels of charge-offs and non-performing loans. Our allowance coverage ratio remains healthy at 1.34% and
1.48%, excluding loans to mortgage companies and the PPP portfolio. We recorded a $65 million provision credit,
giving the stabilizing economic outlook and overall improvement in credit quality. This was the fourth consecutive
quarter with a provision credit.
Turning to capital on slide 15, our CET1 ratio of 9.9% remained strong, but decreased modestly linked quarter. As
Bryan mentioned, we returned $225 million in capital to common stockholders during the quarter, including $144
million or 9 million shares of common stock repurchased.
Turning to the merger integration on slide 16, we continue to make substantial progress across a number of fronts
including conducting additional mock conversions, rolling out additional upgrades to online banking platform and
completing our client communications. We've achieved $104 million in annualized run rate savings against our net
annualized target of $200 million by the end of this year.
Additionally, we continued making solid traction on revenue synergies with $45 million of annualized revenue
synergies that are largely tied to commercial loans with additional synergies tied to debt capital markets,
mortgage and private client wealth. We are extremely focused on retaining and growing our client base and
leveraging our expanded set of products and services.
Turning to slide 17 and 18, we provide our outlook for full-year 2022 and for the first quarter. Our expectations
reflect a relatively robust economic outlook with rate hikes in March, July and December. We also incorporate full
year unemployment of approximately 3.7% with real GDP growth of around 4.5% and a House Price Index
increase of 4.5%.
For full-year 2022, we expect NII to be relatively stable with a roughly $120 million reduction in net merger
accretion and PPP benefits, largely offset by the benefit of higher rates, loan growth and reduced funding costs.
We expect to generate loan growth excluding PPP in the mid-single digit percent range. At period end, we had a
total of $1 billion in PPP loans with remaining fees of approximately $17 million. We now expect the vast majority
of portfolio to be forgiven by the end of the second quarter. We recognize that there has been a fair amount of
6

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
volatility in the expectation of rates recently, so we thought it might be helpful to provide some additional
information on our sensitivity.
First, it is important to note that nearly 90% of our interest rate sensitivity is concentrated at the short end of the
curve. This predominantly reflects the fact that roughly 65% of our loan portfolio is variable rate. Here, I would
note that about $8 billion of those loans are subject to floors with about half of those in the money by
approximately 40 basis points.
We estimate that a 25 basis point increase in Fed funds is worth approximately $16 million per quarter on an 8
basis points of margin benefit. Additionally, we assume approximately 15% interest-bearing deposit betas in our
outlook, given the high levels of excess liquidity. We provided some additional information on our interest rate
sensitivity profile in the appendix.
Regarding non-interest income, we expect a low-teens percent decline, driven by further pressure in fixed income
and mortgage banking, partially offset by improvement in wealth, service charges and card fees. We expect non-
interest expense to remain relatively stable with lower incentives and commissions resulting from fee income and
the continued benefit of merger saves, which will be offset by the impact of inflationary pressures. Our full year
outlook for net charge-off is in the 5 basis point to 15 basis point range. And while credit quality continues to be
strong, we expect that is likely, we will need to begin building reserves to support loan growth in the second half of
2022.
Finally, we expect our full year CET1 ratio to remain in a 9.5% to 10% range, as we focus on organic growth and
opportunistic share repurchases. For the first quarter, we expect NII to be down at the high end of the mid-single
digit range, given the outlook for reduced net merger accretion and PPP benefit. Core NII will decline given a $7
million impact tied to day count, as well as increased pressure from seasonally lower warehouse balances and
continued spread tightening.
We expect low single-digit percent growth excluding PPP and loans to mortgage companies. Regarding non-
interest income, while we anticipate relatively resilient results in our fixed income business, we expect fee income
to be down in the mid-single digit range, with additional decreases tied to our previously announced NSF pricing
changes and seasonality. We expect non-interest expenses to decrease in the low single-digit percent range, with
seasonally higher salaries and benefits more than offset by lower incentives and commissions, as well as other
costs.
Our outlook calls for charge offs to be stable to up modestly with continued positive credit, great migration and
reserve outflows near-term. On capital, as with the full year outlook, we expect our CET1 ratio to remain in the
9.5% to 10% range. Given our recent performance for strong underlying growth dynamics and expanded product
set, we feel very well positioned to capitalize on our diversified business model to deliver enhanced value for our
shareholders.
Finally, turning to slide 19, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities of our diversified
business model, highly attractive franchise and asset-sensitive balance sheet particularly given the improving
economic landscape and outlook for higher rates. Beyond our upcoming systems conversion we are well-
positioned to capture additional revenue synergies as well as continue to pivot expenses and capital investments
to our higher growth opportunities. We also remain committed to making prudent investments to support the
dynamic digital needs of our clients and associates and drive further efficiencies.

Now, I will turn it back to Bryan.

D. Bryan Jordan
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Thank you, Hope. I'm excited about the results of combined organization this year and then what momentum I see
as we look into 2022 and beyond. We have an attractive franchise. We have a very diversified business model
and higher growth markets as well as a strong interest rate sensitivity that Hope described. So, I think we're very,
very well-positioned.
The merger continues to deliver revenue synergies, and the team is highly focused on delivering value-added
advice to clients with improved products and technology, all the while supporting our communities. I'm confident
that we're well on our way to becoming a top performing regional bank and delivering enhanced returns to our
shareholders.
This concludes our prepared remarks. Juan, we can now open it up for questions.

Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning, Bryan. Just around loan growth, the mid-single digits guidance. Two things. One, if you – what are
you assuming happened to the mortgage warehouse in 2022 year-over-year? How much of a drag is that? And
secondly, in terms of the mid-single digit growth, talk to us in terms of upside risks, especially once you get the
systems conversion done, I would think your market should outperform national GDP which should probably lead
to much stronger loan growth as things ramp back up. So, give us a perspective on what could drive upside risk to
that loan growth number?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. This is Hope. I'd be happy to take that. Fannie and Freddie projected 20% decline of origination volume in
Q1 and a 29% decline in full year 2022. So, we are in line with that on a balance as well as compressing spread.

However, we hope to mitigate the decline by developing customer-specific strategies to increase utilization and
using some of our available tools in both pricing and other credit metrics as we move forward in the business.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
This is Susan, Ebrahim. I'll add-on in terms of potential upside to loan growth. Just looking at the momentum that
we had in the second half of 2021, third and fourth quarter, we saw – so period-end loan growth in the number of
our core markets was up significantly. So, the mid-Atlantic, North Carolina market, Middle Tennessee, Georgia
and really the whole state of Florida, we saw quarter-over-quarter growth in those markets, ranging from over 3%
to almost 9% and in C&I, largely C&I, some CRE, and some consumer.
And as mentioned earlier, so I think the [indiscernible] (00:27:36) mentioned that when you think about these
markets, they're very vibrant and when you look at what happened during the pandemic and those businesses
and individuals moving into many of these markets, we have seen opportunity to do more with existing clients as
well as with new prospects. That's the other thing I saw, Ebrahim, as I looked at the new production in the second
half of the year.
Third and fourth quarter, we saw increased percentage of new to bank clients while also serving existing clients.
That's a combination of our existing RMs and our track record of attracting seasoned RMs in many of these
growth markets. And in the Specialty businesses as that were mentioned previously, equipment finance has really
been one of our main synergy items. We've seen good growth in equipment finance, franchise finance, asset
based lending. So, I do think, as you mentioned, there could be upside, assuming things with the economy
continue to improve.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Ebrahim, two additional thoughts, first on mortgage warehouse lending. And so, to describe, we think there are a
number of levers there. And while we would broadly acknowledge that refinance activity is likely to drop and
overall purchase money activity is going to drop. We have done an outstanding job, in my view, of sort of
repositioning the portfolio and gaining additional market share from existing customers. So, while we could be
down a bit, I think we've done a good job, taking the lows out of that business by repositioning with our customer
base.
And as Susan said, we see great opportunities in these higher growth markets that we serve, both with existing
customers and new to bank. I was really pleased with all of the great work our bankers did with new to bank
customers. And as we said in previous calls, we like everybody saw a bit of a headwind in commercial real estate
as projects went to the permanent markets earlier and they really put pressure. Originations have been good
there, and I think I mentioned in my opening comments our commitments were up strongly at year end. And I look
at that as a spring loading on the balance sheet. That will drive growth, particularly as it relates to CRE where
those projects will fund up over time. So, we're pretty optimistic about our ability to do, as Hope said, deliver
something in those mid-single digits.

reasonable timeframe two, three, four, five years. The stock has underperformed regional bank peers. Talk to us
in terms of the importance of this year. And then as you emerge out of this integration of actually getting the stock

to work like what do you think is needed and do you think 2022 will be the year that we actually finally see some
of these – the power of the First Horizon franchise actually work for shareholders?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. It's a good question and I think an important one. We have, I think in 2022, a number of things that I think
will be a catalyst for not only 2022, but I think we'll start to prove out even further in 2023. First, one of the things
that's sort of been an overhang that impacted us hit leading into the transition is our credit performance from the
great financial crisis. And I think through this cycle, our credit team led by Susan along with our aligned bankers
led by Anthony and Anthony Restel and David Popwell proved that we've got very strong credit quality in the
balance sheet. So, I think, we've proven that, that repositioning of the balance sheet has worked.
We've also been dealing with a pandemic and integrating too large organizations in that period of time. And we
feel very strongly that, that organization, IBERIABANK First Horizon combined, truly is better together. We're
seeing great growth opportunities, we're seeing the benefits of being in 15 of the largest 20 MSAs in the south,
having strong share, great bankers, and the ability to deliver differentiated level of service with a strong balance
sheet.
And while 2022 will have a bit of reset, simply because some of the PPP earnings and purchase accounting
accretion will be offset, we think with the rate increases that are likely to occur, Hope mentioned, I think March,
July, and December. December, largely being a driver of 2023 rather than 2022 and growth in the balance sheet,
we're very optimistic not only about our repositioning this year and delivering shareholder value, but also how it
positions us for creating shareholder value in 2023 and beyond.

Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
I wanted to first ask on the fee income guidance for 1Q relative to 2022, it seems like the guidance implies that
the fee income is fairly soft in the first quarter and then kind of builds thereafter. And so, I want to make sure if
that was sort of how you were thinking about fee income? And then, in terms of 1Q, would you describe the fixed
income business as a primary driver of that decrease and maybe, talk about what you're expecting for an average
ADR for the quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. So, fee income is seasonal in our business in two ways. One, mortgage activity tends to be lower in the first
part of the year and the number of business days also in the fixed income business also impacts it. As we look at
our average daily revenue across the year, first quarter included, we think it could moderate a little bit from 2021
levels, but we think fixed income will be continued to be reasonably strong, given the amount of excess liquidity
that still exists in the system, the steepness of the yield curve.
And so, I would expect something that looks more like for the full year, something that looks more like what we
saw in the fourth quarter. But I'm sure, there's seasonality in a number of these businesses. And so, first quarter
can be a little bit softer. It will build as we get into the second quarter and beyond in our view and as we get back
to the stronger seasons.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brett Rabatin Q
Analyst, Hovde Group LLC
Okay. Great. And then, on the expense guide and just the integration and the expense savings this year, it's my
understanding that the bulk of the expense savings comes more in 2Q and 3Q rather than first quarter with the
conversion. Can you maybe talk about the remaining expense savings from the transaction and the timing of that
this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. This is Hope. I'll take that. We will not have much in Q1 with conversion in February and our associates that
are leaving us after conversion, leaving in March. We expect to see the majority come through in Q2 and Q3. But
as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that will be offset by our increasing inflationary environment as well as
our annual raises that will go into effect in March. That will be muted through the quarters, although we will be
achieving the expense savings.

As it relates to that, Hope, does the inflationary pressures that everyone is seeing, has that not changed your
outlook from an expense perspective meaningfully?

Hope Dmuchowski A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
I guess it's about how you define meaningfully. We have changed our guidance for 2022 from prior. We said we
thought quarter Q2 and Q3 would decrease in Q1 and now we're saying we expect it to be flattish throughout the
year. So, that is a change to a prior guidance.

Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Just to get a little more granular on the capital markets business, Bryan and Hope,
do you think that the clients with all their cash and liquidity, does that help the business as you get through the
first quarter? I understand seasonality just mentioned, but just that liquidity, that was a lot different than what
existed the last time that the Fed tightened. Does that help the business as this year plays out?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. We think it does, Chris. The fixed income business is impacted by a bunch of different dynamics, but when
you have a steepening yield curve like we've seen over the last several weeks and you see that much liquidity on
the sidelines, we think it will be helped. And while that's to be seen, I'm optimistic that we will see continued
activity there. The first quarter, so we're on the 20th day of January, our average daily revenue thus far in the
quarter are right in line with our expectations. And we think that as long as that stickiness remains in the curve,
liquidities in the system, we think that that can be a very, very good business for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher Marinac Q
Analyst, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC
Okay. Great. Thank you for that. And then just a follow up as it pertains to some of the new bells and whistles that
you're going to get for the lending teams once the systems conversion is done. Is it proper to kind of expect
maybe two quarters to pass by before you can kind of judge some of the big progress on new loans? I'm just kind
of curious what's the fair expectation there?

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
Yeah. I think it will continue to build. There's no doubt about that. When you're going through an integration,
you're in an inward focus. People are focused on transitioning existing customers reaching out. We're also, like
everybody else in the industry, dealing with a transition from LIBOR to SOFR or something else. And I would say
in that context, I'm really excited about the momentum we showed C&I loan growth, for example, in the fourth
quarter was, I think, up 2%, roughly 8% annualized. Commitments were up. And I think that momentum is
building, and I think our teams have done a really good job of doing that and as I referred earlier in the framework
of our credit risk appetite. So, I'm encouraged by that momentum. I think that will continue to build as we see
further strengthening in the economy, as we see sort of the receding of the Omicron variant and hopefully lesser
impactful waves as we go forward. But I think while we get through this integration, I think that momentum will
build.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A
Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
And Chris, hi. This is Susan. I agree with Bryan. When we talked earlier about some of the revenue synergies and
we talked a couple of quarters about that, seeing very strong referrals. And you've referred to them as new bells
and whistles, the new products and new Specialty lines. So, referrals into equipment, finance, asset-based
lending, franchise finance, and I would say reverse referrals from Specialty teams into our markets is building as
well. And, as bankers, the other bankers have been successful introducing Specialty businesses, additional cash
management, treasury management products. We do think that will continue to build among the bankers in all of
our markets and Specialty business post-conversion.

Michael Rose Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just back to the fixed income business, you mentioned that
the curve remains steep. But what if we do get a couple rate hikes and the curve does flatten out, is that I think
the guidance that you've given previously for ADRs was somewhere in the 1 to 1.2. In that scenario or any other
scenarios, could you see downward pressure on that ADR guide? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. If you get a much flatter yield curve or you get an inverted yield curve, it will be less attractive for that
business without a doubt. We don't expect that. But that is a possibility.

Okay. That helpful. And then, Bryan, as we think about this coming year, obviously, there's been a lot of work
behind the scenes. What are some of your strategic priorities as we move through the year, both on the revenue
and on the expense side? Just in broad strokes. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah, yeah. First and foremost, it is working with our customers and our communities to get through this
integration. There's been a tremendous amount of effort into the planning, the testing, the retesting, and the re-
retesting. And we're now doing a lot of communication, outbound calling with our customers, getting folks logging
into microsites and things like that. So, first and foremost, is getting the integration done.
Beyond that, it is, as Susan said, taking the broader product set that we have in the organization and continuing to
drive synergies across our equipment finance business or our mortgage business. Mortgage, for example, is
something we've been out of for roughly 10 years in the First Horizon business – 12 years. So, that's a new tool in
the old legacy First Horizon footprint. So, capitalizing on those things.
And then thirdly, and maybe most importantly, beyond the integration is, how do we take advantage of the huge
growth opportunities that we have in these existing markets where we have a relatively small share, the ability to
attract bankers and proven ability to attract bankers and to develop a customized go-to-market approach in very
attractive markets. And so, we're very, very focused on how we take all of those and drive a tremendous amount
of organic growth and build that momentum for the next several years.

Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
I want to start, so regarding the outlook for expenses to be up mid-single digit ex the incentives, right after almost
10 years of cutting expenses nonstop, are you guys now running out of wood to chop there, because in the past,
we've seen you offset this?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. I don't think we're running out of wood to chop. As Hope said, we will realize a fair amount more of our cost
savings this year. But, by definition, in the way we're realizing it, we still have some cost savings that will fall to the
bottom line or accretive in 2023. I think we've got a combination or confluence of things. One is, we're not immune
to 7-plus-percent inflation that others see, and we think we can moderate a significant amount of the inflation. We
think that what we're looking at is an environment where our costs will go up some across a number of different
areas, but that we have opportunities to moderate that over the next couple of years.
So, a big focus for us will be once we get this integration done, and I think the way you think about that
integration, we've frozen a lot of things for a couple of years other than making some systems investments and
improvements. But from a process, thinking about the organization, we will continue to look at that in 2022 and
2023 through our team led by Randy Bryan, and who's been leading the integration. And so, we've got a number
of things that would fall into that category of additional wood to chop. So, we think there are further cost reduction
opportunities we can use to offset some of these headwinds that inflation puts on the business.

people and products.

Steven Alexopoulos Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And Bryan, you mentioned the companies are inward looking, right, while you're going
through an integration, particularly the system integration. When do you see the company moving more fully back
on offense, right, being more outward looking? Does that happen in 2Q? And then, it's interesting the comment
better together, compared to other southeast banks, how should we think about this new company from a growth
perspective?

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
Yeah. So, I think to be very, very fair to our bankers, I think they've done a great job managing an inward focus
and an outward focus and doing a good job keeping both balls in the air. We can put down the inward integration
focus ball. So yeah, I think in the second quarter, we won't be juggling that one anymore and we'll be focused
exclusively on sort of that outward go-to-market approach.
I think it's hard to say, okay, relative to south eastern peers, how will you do? But I firmly believe that given our
approach to markets, our product set and most importantly, our geography and differentiated proposition, I think
we can be better than most by executing day in, day out on really being differentiated for customers. Sometimes
our product people get frustrated when they hear this, but I want to say this, but we do is unique in the sense that
all of our products are commodities. I say, our money's no brainer and our loan documents are no easier to read.
So, where we make a difference is our people in the way we deliver for our customers. And I think we truly are
differentiated there. You couple that with great geography. I think we can be extraordinarily good in terms of
delivering value in the Southeast.

Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Jared Shaw from Wells Fargo Securities. Please Jared,
your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hey, good morning. Yeah, I guess when looking at the expectation for earning asset growth, what's your
expectation for funding? With a 15% assumed beta on deposits, do you think that deposits actually really grow in
2022 or are you expecting to utilize a lot of that cash position?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yes, Jared. This is Bryan. Hope may have a slightly different view. I think deposits will get drawn down some over
the course of the year. I think our perception of the marketplace today is excess liquidity is not unique to our
balance sheet. It is endemic across the -shouldn't use endemic in a pandemic. It is across the industry. So, at the
end of the day, we think that there's sort of a balance between what happens with deposits and what happened
with rates. But we think, 15% beta which is not all that different in the lag that people saw or that we saw coming
out of the great financial crisis is likely to be a good place to start our modeling, that lag comes out in subsequent
years. But we think that there's an opportunity for a little bit of deposit rate lag in the near-term.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
I agree with everything Brian said. We spent a lot of time on kind of what the right scenario was, with the excess
liquidity in the system, obviously zero beta seems to make sense. However, as we get to a more normalized post-
pandemic environment, I think the environment coming in a lot more competitive and people – our peers may start
16


First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
(FHN) Corrected Transcript
Q4 2021 Earnings Call 20-Jan-2022
trying to be on price on a client relationship basis, which will require, I think, the industry to move forward.
Eventually, clients will start asking to make some money on their deposits, especially where they have multiple
relationships with a company. So, I think it's less about the liquidity and more about just the competitive landscape
probably driving up deposit pricing this year.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then, shifting to the allowance in credit, talking about getting closer to the point where you
start building allowance from here. We're still pretty far above the day one level of 110 basis points. And then,
obviously, you have the benefit of the acquisition with the double mark there. Do you think that you actually get to
the day one level before building or maybe we don't assume it gets back to day one with the improving economic
backdrop?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
So, Jared, we think probably two more quarters of reserve releases based on what we know today and the
outlook for the economy. We may need to start building reserves in the second half of the year. In terms of an
outlook for ADL, probably in the 115 to 120 basis points, just a little bit higher than your 110 basis points that you
mentioned, but roughly there. Obviously, the models are quite complex. But hopefully that answered your
question.
[indiscernible] (00:51:26)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
I'm sorry, Jared. I was going to say CECL creates some interesting dynamics. The day you book a loan under
CECL, you effectively book at less than a 1% reserve. You book it at 99%, you basically book the loan growth and
set up a 1% reserve. And so, there's a dynamic in this transition phase here while we think credit quality is likely
to continue to get better and likely could drive some further reserve releases headed towards that day one
number. At the same time, loan growth is going to drive some offsetting impact in that just simply because of the
way CECL mechanically works.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then finally, for me, I guess looking at the securities portfolio, I've heard you say you
purchased the $700 million at 1.7% yield. Can you sort of walk us through what caused the decline in yield when
you look quarter-over-quarter with the average yields going from 1.48% to 1.43% with that growth, is there a
bigger restructuring behind that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
No. There was no restructuring. That portfolio kicks off a tremendous amount of cash flow, so you're just
reinvesting at lower rates.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)

That's right. Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Susan L. Springfield A

And the book yields on the cash flows that we got was around 80 basis points.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. So, should we expect to see in a stable rate environment or not assuming any rate move, should we
assume that securities yields grows now from here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Given the inherent steepness that's crept into the yield curve if that remains, you would expect that it would grow
over time, yes.

Jared Shaw Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

was just trying to reconcile it with the purchase at 1.70% yield that...

Hey, Brady.

Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
In addition to your asset sensitivity, it seems like First Horizon has a pretty big lever just because 19% of your
average earning assets are in cash, your bond book is still only about 11% of average earning assets. It feels like
you could easily be throwing more cash into the bond book. We have seen the long end of the curve increase
pretty nicely. I know it's still pretty low. But how do you think about materially increasing the size of the bond book
going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Hope Dmuchowski A
Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Brady, this is Hope, and as I'm in my seventh week here and I've only been to one call, I'll tell you we are
spending a lot of time talking about this. I know we've got a lot of pressure externally on that. So, we are looking
at it. Especially in a rising rate environment, we need to look at how we position our balance sheet to protect
against the downside, as well as what the right amount of cash as we have. I expect that in 2022 and 2023, we
will see cash leave as the competitive landscape increases, and we're not willing to price up for a non-relationship
deposit. So, the short way of saying it, as the new CFO, stay tuned in the next quarter, I'll have a little bit more
information for you on that.
Bryan, I don't know if you want to add anything.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
So, I think that's right. I think the big driver in the near-term is sort of opportunistic investment, because we
recognize we have a fair amount of excess cash similar to what we did in the fourth quarter or third – fourth
quarter. And as you pointed out, as rates move away from zero, now we've got to add more fixed rate assets to
protect against the downside and the bond portfolio is the place to do that. So, my guess is, as we look at this
balance sheet, we'll have opportunities to put some of that cash to work at higher yielding points and create some
incremental earnings, sort of to your thesis, Brady, that we have a bit of a lever there, and in addition to a floating
rate loan portfolio.

Brady Gailey Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
All right. And then my second question is really on the buyback. If you look last year in 2021, First Horizon
repurchased 4% to 5% of the company, which was pretty notable. So, it feels like growth is going to be better this
year. I know you kind of prioritized growth over buybacks as you look at capital, but how should we think about
the buyback? I mean, the stock is still cheap, do you think that First Horizon will still be notably active in the
buyback this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
D. Bryan Jordan A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, First Horizon Corp. (Tennessee)
Yeah. We do think that the stock is cheap. And as you said, we do prioritize organic growth over repurchase
activity. And while we think that the strength of the balance sheet will continue to grow through organic growth
and there will be opportunities to deploy it there. Hope alluded, we're comfortable in that 9.5% to 10% CET1
range. We're at the high end of that range now. So, I think that provides us the opportunity at the right spot to take
advantage of what we think are attractive levels to buy our stock. So, yeah, it will continue to be one of the levers
we use from time to time to get excess capital out of the organization, and we'll balance it between organic growth
and getting our capital ratios right for the economic environment.
