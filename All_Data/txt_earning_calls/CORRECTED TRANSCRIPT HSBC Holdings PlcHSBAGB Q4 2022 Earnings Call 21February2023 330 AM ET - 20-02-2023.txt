Good morning to everyone in the room in London today and great to see you all again. And good afternoon to
those watching from Hong Kong and around the world.
Before Georges takes you through the Q4 numbers, I'll start with a summary of our strategic progress. When we
started our transformation three years ago, we also revisited our core purpose and values. Opening up a world of
opportunity is the reason HSBC exists. We are making it a reality for our customers. Our results today are
evidence of that. And I'm pleased that our performance also demonstrates that our people are living and breathing
our values, particularly the fourth value, which is get it done. I will demonstrate during the discussion today that
we have achieved a lot over the last three years and that we are committed to doing even more.
I want to start by telling you the three elements I'm going to cover in the presentation today. Transformation was
the first phase of our strategy execution. Three years ago, the fair criticism of HSBC was that unprofitable, or
subscale businesses and clients were dragging down good profitability from our international proposition and from
the profits generated in Hong Kong and the UK. I'm pleased to say we've addressed this. Our international
connectivity is now underpinned by good broad-based profit generation around the world.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 21-Feb-2023
Delivery in 2022 is all about the good set of results we've just announced. I will come to the detail later, but I'm
pleased, adjusted profits before tax were up 17%. We're firmly on track to achieve our returns target for 2023
onwards. And we expect to have substantial distribution capacity for higher dividends, more buybacks, and
potentially a special dividend in early 2024.
But there's also so much more we can achieve. So, the final element of the presentation is growth and returns. It's
all about how we will further improve performance going forward. As we've transformed, we've built a strong
platform for the future that will enable us to meet our customers' needs. And I expect wealth, payments and FX,
fee income, technology investment, and climate finance to provide new value creation opportunities in the years
to come.
So, taking these three messages in turn, starting with transformation. Three years ago, we set out to tackle a
series of fundamental problems, loss-making businesses, unprofitable products and clients, inefficient capital, and
costs. Our transformation journey has six components, which I will run through in more detail on the following
slides.
Our international connectivity remains our biggest differentiator. And we've grown and protected many of our
market-leading international businesses during the three years. But we've done that while repositioning
unprofitable and non-strategic businesses, particularly in the US and Europe. That's resulted in a client
proposition that is now built on international connectivity, underpinned by a broad base of geographic profit
penetration (sic) [generation].
All of this has been supported by strong cost discipline, which has enabled us to drive a step change in our
technology investment. We've also removed the dilutive scrip dividend and introduced the new sustainable
dividend policy, which is delivering attractive ongoing returns for shareholders and enabling us to invest in the
business. So, crucially, we've created a strong platform for improved growth and returns with new opportunities
for value creation. Our focus now is to capitalize on these opportunities.
Taking each of these in turn. In terms of international connectivity, our greatest strength remains our ability to
connect the world's major trading and investment blocks. We are the world's number one trade bank. Top 3 for
FX, and a leading payments company. Last year, we processed more than $600 trillion of payments globally.
International is also core to our value proposition. Around 45% of our wholesale client business is done cross-
border. And in Wealth and Personal Banking, we now have 6 million international customers, which is up 7% on
last year. This is significant because our international customers generate around twice the average revenue as
our domestic customers.
Our international connectivity is also translating into higher revenue and market share. Since 2019, we've grown
Global Payments Solutions revenue by 6% CAGR, trade revenue by 5% CAGR, and revenue from Global Foreign
Exchange has increased by 12% CAGR. Overall, transaction banking revenue was up by 7% CAGR over the last
three years. We also see an opportunity to create even more value by continuing to grow these product lines over
the coming years.
The next slide drills down into how we reshaped our portfolio. Across the group, we reduced risk-weighted assets
by a cumulative $128 billion, well in excess of our target of $110 billion. We've made key strategic decisions to
sell our US mass market retail bank, our retail banking operations in France, and our banking business in
Canada.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 21-Feb-2023
We've also announced exits from Russia and Greece with other potential smaller exits being considered. We've
reallocated more of our capital to Asia. And by Asia, I mean the whole of Asia. We want to build strong wealth
businesses in mainland China, India and Singapore, alongside strong business we already have in Hong Kong.
We accelerated this process through bolt-on acquisitions and investments in the last 12 months. We've completed
the integration of AXA Singapore and L&T Investment Management in India. And in mainland China as well as
continuing the organic build-out of Pinnacle, we had seven main license approvals since 2020. These enabled us
to take full ownership of HSBC Life China and increase our majority stake in HSBC Qianhai to 90%.
As I said earlier, we now have an international connectivity, underpinned by good, broad-based profit generation,
as this slide demonstrates. This is the single biggest change compared to three years ago. I won't go through all
the numbers on this slide, but I will mention a few. The total amount of adjusted profit contributed by Asia,
excluding Hong Kong and mainland China, was more than $4 billion in 2022, an increase of 23% compared to
2019. Mainland China, excluding associate income from BoCom, contributed around $1 billion of profit last year in
a challenging year. And India contributed a further $900 million of adjusted profit.
Outside Asia, the Middle East generated $1.8 billion of adjusted profits last year. HSBC UK delivered $5 billion of
adjusted profits, and we've got leaner, more profitable businesses in Continental Europe and the US. Continental
Europe generated adjusted profits of over $2 billion and the US adjusted profits of over $1 billion. Both of those
businesses were close to loss making or loss making three years ago.
Mexico is another high returning business. It delivered return on tangible equity of 18%. And worthy of note that
60% of new to bank retail customers last year were acquired through corporate client relationships by the
provision of employee banking services and payroll services, demonstrating the value of our connected model in
the country.
The next slide focuses on the tight cost discipline. We've demonstrated and we will maintain. The reduction of the
corporate real estate, our branch network and operations head count have all delivered material savings. And we
expect to achieve further efficiencies in the years to come.
But the most important point on this slide is that we've used these cost savings to increase investment in
technology. 18% (sic) [19%] out in operations costs, 18% (sic) [19%] in in technology investment. This is spending
in the right place to build the business of the future, and it has enabled us to fundamentally change the way we
operate.
Our formal cost reduction program, three-year cost reduction program, has now ended, but we still expect more
than $1 billion of cost saves to flow through into 2023 from that program. There will be no easing up at all in our
cost discipline. But I think it's right that we will also continue to identify opportunities to create efficiencies going
forward that will deliver sustainable cost savings in future years, with any associated costs from those programs
reported through the cost line, not treated below the line as sig items.
Whilst we have transformed, we have also invested in areas that we expect to deliver strong growth and returns in
the future. Our strong balance sheet has always been a defining characteristic of HSBC, and we've continued to
grow the deposit book and assets over the past three years. This is benefiting our performance now that rates
have increased.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 21-Feb-2023
Developing our Wealth business has also been a strategic priority. Our investments over the past three years are
gaining traction, reflected in revenues of over $9 billion in 2022, excluding market impacts, which is a 9% CAGR
compared to 2020. It's also reflected by increased insurance market share in Hong Kong.
The next slide sets out the impact of the step change we made in technology investment. The faster services,
reduced friction and more competitive products that this investment has enabled have been critical to improving
the customer experience. With our digital propositions, our aim is to build once, deploy globally. Our upgraded
mobile banking app is available in 24 markets and has around 13 million active customers. HSBC Kinetic, our
award-winning business banking app in the UK, now has around 53,000 new to bank customers.
And as well as Global Wallet and Global Money, we've rolled out our new digital trade finance platform in Hong
Kong and the UK, so that our market-leading businesses are well positioned for the next 10 years. In addition, we
are launching new products like HSBC Orion, which is our proprietary tokenization bond issuance platform using
blockchain. The first public bond was priced on it last month.
Turning now to delivery in 2022. I'm pleased with our 2022 performance. As you know from Q3, the reported
numbers include a $2.4 billion impairment for the planned disposal of our French retail business. Adjusted
revenue was up 18% on the back of a strong net interest income performance. And adjusted profits were up 17%.
We delivered a good cost outcome in a high inflation environment by containing adjusted cost growth to around
1%. Expected credit losses were a $3.6 billion charge. The dividend was $0.32 per share. The CET1 ratio was
14.2%. And we achieved a reported RoTE of 9.9% or 11.6% once you strip out significant items. So, we're firmly
on track to deliver returns of 12% plus from 2023 onwards.
I'm now going to quickly run through our four strategic pillars, starting with focus on our strengths. Our market-
leading Commercial Banking franchise had a very good year. Adjusted revenue was up almost 30% on last year.
There was further good growth in trade and Global Payments Solutions benefited from higher interest rates. It
was encouraging to see fee income grow by 8%, and there was strong adjusted revenue growth across all
regions.
In Wealth and Personal Banking, revenue was up 16% overall. Personal Banking had a particularly strong year
and lending balances were up 3% despite subdued economic conditions in Hong Kong. Wealth was also up,
excluding market impacts. And one of the best signs that our wealth strategy has gained traction is net new
invested assets of $80 billion in 2022, an increase of 25% compared to 2021. This is highly promising for future
revenue generation. There was also continued growth in the value of new business in our Asia insurance
franchise, despite adverse market conditions. And again, there was strong revenue growth in all geographies.
Global Banking and Markets also performed very well in 2022. Markets and Securities Services was up 14%, due
mainly to rate rises and a stand-out foreign exchange performance. Banking was up 17%, also mainly due to
higher rates. In a challenging year for investment banking globally, this good performance underlines the
resilience of our model.
Collaboration revenues from cross-selling Global Banking and Markets products to customers in Commercial
Banking and Wealth and Personal Banking were up 6%. There was strong growth in client business booked in the
East but originated in Europe and the Americas, up around 30% on the previous year. This again underlines
geographic diversification of our revenues and that our greatest strength is connecting the world's major economic
blocs.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 21-Feb-2023
The next slide is on digitize our scale, our second pillar. It illustrates the outcomes of our increasing investment in
technology. Within retail and wholesale, penetration levels increased materially. More than 75% of Commercial
Banking customers are now digitally active, and almost half of retail customers are now mobile active. We also
believe we can grow these numbers further.
The next slide covers energize for growth and how we're changing the culture of HSBC. Taking out unnecessary
layers of management has helped increase our speed and agility. In our last staff survey, the number of
colleagues who say that work processes allow them to work efficiently was 6 percentage points (sic) [6%] above
the sector benchmark.
Confidence within the organization has also increased. 77% of our colleagues told us that they are confident
about our future, which is 7 percentage points above the sector benchmark, and an increase of 3 percentage
points since 2021.
We made further progress against our diversity commitments with increases in representation of female leaders
and Black heritage leaders. 36% of our key leadership roles are now located in Asia. And if I reflect on the
leadership of our Asian business five years ago versus today, I see much more Asian heritage talent and a strong
pipeline of talent coming through that we continue to develop. At the same time, we know we have more to do in
all these areas.
The next slide looks at our final pillar and the leading role that we're playing in the transition to net zero. The
amount of sustainable financing and investment provided and facilitated in 2022 was up slightly, despite the
market for green, social, sustainable and sustainability-linked bonds being substantially down. The cumulative
total amount since the start of 2020 is now $211 billion.
We've set new targets for on-balance sheet financed emissions for six high emitting sectors. We recognize that
methodologies and data for measuring emissions will continue to evolve. And our own disclosures will, therefore,
continue to evolve as well. We continue to reduce emissions across our own operations and supply chain, which
were down more than 58% since 2019.
Finally, my third message is about growth and returns. We are firmly on track to deliver returns of at least 12% in
2023. But there's also so much more we can achieve and we can deliver higher growth and returns as we move
out of transformation and into value creation. We plan to grow our core businesses, which are built on our
international connectivity and the strong, broad-based growth we have now spanning every region.
The investment we've made in new sources of value creation, wealth, payments and FX, fee income, technology,
and sustainability will all increase and diversify our revenue. And we won't be relinquishing our grip on costs,
because it enables us to spend in areas that create value. Our improved profitability and sustainable dividend
policy will give us a substantial distribution capacity.
With a 50% dividend payout ratio established for 2023 and 2024, a return to quarterly dividends from Q1, the
consideration of buybacks brought forward to the Q1 results, and on top of this, the consideration of a special
dividend of $0.21 to be paid in early 2024, subject to the completion of the Canada transaction and necessary
approvals. So, our current strategy remains the best way to improve returns for our shareholders.
And now I'll hand over to Georges. Thanks, Georges.

Georges Elhedery
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Noel. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining in person and via webcast today. I am glad to see many
familiar faces and I'm looking forward to meeting those of you I haven't had the opportunity to meet yet.
Before I get into the Q4 numbers and given this is the first time I'm in front of you in this job, I would like to share a
few thoughts about my approach. You may know I've already spent 18 years with this firm running various
businesses, including as CEO of the Middle East and most recently co-CEO of Global Banking and Markets. But
what you may not know is that I spend most of this time creating efficiencies to achieve the purpose of investing in
growth.
So, indeed, I oversaw the sales of non-strategic businesses in the Middle East, and this allowed us to focus our
investments into Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. And when I led GB&M with Greg, I drove the
rationalization of our product line and booking structure to focus on the areas where we had competitive
advantage and could best serve our clients. So, as a result, I materially reduced RWAs and costs and repurposed
those saves to invest in technology for the future of the business.
I believe, therefore, the growth cannot be achieved without a clear focus on our strength. Therefore, purposeful
transformation and elimination of areas of marginal impact are paramount. Equally and as importantly, clinical
delivery and keeping a tight grip on spending are key to unlocking the potential to invest.
So, as I approach this next phase, I want to emphasize my three focus areas. So, one, continuing to support our
business to deliver growth and returns, which is underpinned by improving – continuing to improve customer
service and attracting and retaining talent. Number two is continuing to generate the further efficiencies required
to support the investment I just spoke about. And number three, therefore, the guiding principle that supports all of
this will be absolute cost and capital discipline.
I'll turn now to the Q4 numbers. Reported profits before tax were at $5.2 billion, up 95% on last year's fourth
quarter. Adjusted profits before tax were at $6.8 billion, up 92%. Adjusted revenues were up 38%, driven mainly
by net interest income growth of 53% and higher non-net interest income. We booked an expected credit loss
charge of $1.4 billion in the quarter, and then adjusted costs were up 2% due to higher technology spend and
higher performance-related pay.
Compared to the previous quarter, lending and deposits were both down, but this was largely due to our banking
operations in Canada being reclassified as held for sale. So, if you excluded this, lending was down 2%, mainly
due to subdued conditions in Hong Kong and deposits were up.
For the full year, the dividend is at $0.32 per share with a second interim dividend of $0.23 per share. Also, after
strong capital generation and lower currency adjusted RWAs, our CET1 ratio was at 14.2%, an increase of 80
basis point on the third quarter.
Our effective tax rate for 2022 was at 5%. This includes credits from the recognition of deferred tax asset related
primarily in the UK as well as other deferred tax assets and uncertain tax position reassessments. If you excluded
these credits, then the effective tax rate for 2022 was 19.2%, and we expect our normalized effective tax rate for
2023 to be around 20%.
This slide now shows another strong adjusted revenue performance with overall growth of 38% compared to the
fourth quarter of 2021, driven mostly by recent rate levels. There was strong growth in all businesses, Noel

indicated; Wealth and Personal Banking revenues up 45%, Commercial Banking up 51%, and Global Banking
and Markets up 16%.
Net fee income was down 11%. This was mainly due to, number one, lower wealth distribution revenue driven by
lower equities turnover in Hong Kong in general and mutual fund sales. And this is reflecting soft equity markets in
general, yeah. And two, lower capital markets and advisory activity, which also impacted Global Banking and
Markets.
On this slide, you can see that reported net interest income was at $9.6 billion, up 41% on last year's fourth
quarter. The net interest margin was at 174 basis points, up 17 basis point on the third quarter of 2022 and up 55
basis points on the fourth quarter of 2021. We continue to guide to a full year 2023 net interest income of at least
$36 billion on an IFRS 4 basis.
Let me unpack this a little bit. Our guidance, therefore, is unchanged to what we indicated at quarter three. We do
view this as a conservative guidance given current FX rate tailwinds and the strong fourth quarter performance.
So, this is why we're emphasizing on at least $36 billion, it's very important.
And there are a number of factors that we need to be aware of, which is driving us to be conservative in our
approach. First one is the potential lag effect of customer migration to time deposits. The second one is the
competitive pressures we may be facing in deposit pricing. And the third one is, obviously, the impact of foreign
exchange and future rates outlook. We do not consensus and we're not seeking to change it. We will be updating
you on this NII performance throughout the year starting at the Q1 results when we will also incorporate the
impact of IFRS 17 in our guidance.
We retained a cautious outlook on loan growth in the short term, but continue to expect mid-single-digit
percentage annual loan growth in the medium to long term. Historically, our earnings have been very sensitive to
short-term interest rate movements, and we have started to address this lately with additional structural hedging
positions given the current rate levels. We will also update you, I will certainly update you, later in the year on the
progress towards this net interest income stabilization or mitigation.
Turning to credit. Our fourth quarter ECL charge was $1.4 billion, which includes $0.6 billion for our mainland
China corporate real estate exposure. If you excluded this portfolio, the ECL charge was $0.8 billion or around 30
basis points of loans with limited signs of credit deterioration. So, our main indicators, therefore, are still holding
up.
Given the macroeconomic headwinds, we expect an ECL charge of around 40 basis points for the full year 2023.
Our ECL charge as a percentage of average loans includes loan balances held for sale from the planned sales of
Canada and France retail. Therefore, when you exclude them, you need to add another 4 to 5 basis point on top
of that number.
I do get a lot of questions on mainland China exposure, mainland China corporate real estate specifically. So, in
the spirit of transparency and having done a lot of work at the dynamics of this portfolio, let me zoom in and walk
you through that logic.
First, our principal area of focus remains the portfolio booked in Hong Kong. The onshore portfolio is performing
and the security is working. The exposure booked in Hong Kong reduced by around 20% in the second half of the
year, from $11.7 billion at Q2 to $9.4 billion. And this is primarily due to repayments.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 21-Feb-2023
In Q4, we did see some further deterioration in that sector. So, we looked at the portfolio again and decided to
increase the share of sub-standard and credit impaired exposures to around 60% of that portfolio. That's up from
around 35% at Q2. And by doing so, we increased our provisions accordingly.
So, now, if you zoom in on the $6 billion exposure that we now rate as sub-standard or credit impaired, $1.1
billion is secured with minimal ECL due to the security held. So, then against the remaining $4.9 billion, we are
holding $1.7 billion of provision, circa 35% coverage ratio. And within this, our coverage ratio against the
unsecured credit impaired exposure is around [ph] 50% – 55% (00:31:20). We also run a number of downside
scenarios and I've included some of that analysis in the deck, which we can discuss in Q&A if you wish to.
But to be clear, we did not need to factor those downside scenarios on the 31st of December number. And since
then, our view of the sector has become more positive following more accommodative policy stance that we've
been seeing. So, we are currently comfortable with our coverage level, but we will continue to monitor the
situation very closely.
Okay. I'll move on to costs now. Fourth quarter operating expenses were up 2% on the same period last year, as
most of the cost saves were broadly offset by technology spend and higher performance-related pay. The UK
bank levy for 2022 was offset by credits from overpayments we made related to prior years. We expect an annual
charge of around $200 million for 2023. Rebasing prior year costs at constant currency for hyperinflation
economies, and that's specifically Turkey and Argentina, added around $200 million of cost growth to our adjusted
cost base, so around half of the increase and when you're comparing 2022 to 2021.
Our formal cost to achieve transformation program, what we called CTA program, is now complete. We did
achieve $5.6 billion of gross cost saves, which was somewhat at the top of our expectations, with an associated
cost to achieve spend of $6.5 billion, which was towards the lower end of our guided range.
As Noel said, we're still seeking and finding opportunities to create efficiencies that will deliver sustainable cost
saves in future years. The costs thereof will be above the line. And we're now considering up to $300 million of
additional costs for severance in 2023. This will enable us to take out further management layers. These costs will
be reported in our costs line.
Taking this into account, we're now aiming for approximately 3% cost growth in 2023, which remains a tough
target in a high inflation environment. You should probably expect our 2023 costs to be marginally higher in Q1 as
we're absorbing the rundown of the residual costs from the cost to achieve program, just to notice.
I move on to capital now and the three points I wanted to call out here is, first, our CET1 ratio at 14.2%, up 80
basis point on the previous quarter, is mainly due to a $8.5 billion capital benefit from higher profits and lower FX-
adjusted underlying RWAs. Second, we're back within our CET1 ratio target operating range, which remains 14%,
14.5% for the medium term. The intention is to manage this range further down from medium to longer term. And
given now we have returned to our target operating range six month earlier than we initially indicated, we have
brought forward the consideration of future buybacks to the Q1 results.
And finally, on the proceeds generated by the planned sale of our Canada banking operations, subject to the
completion of the transaction, of course, we anticipate three potential uses. One, a special dividend of $0.21 per
share, which will be the first priority use; two, we'll consider additional buybacks over and above any existing
buyback program; and three, we'll retain capital as required within the business. And we will update you on these
later in the year.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 21-Feb-2023
Finally, on guidance, we are reiterating our guidance of at least $36 billion of net interest income for 2023. We
remain on track to deliver a return on tangible equity of at least 12% from 2023 onwards. And as I explained, we
are now targeting approximately 3% cost growth in 2023. Our capital allocation target for Asia remains unchanged
at 50%. Now, given the changes in the macroeconomic environment, together with the IFRS 17, we do not intend
to continue to track insurance and fees as a percentage of group revenue nor Wealth and Personal Banking as a
percentage of group tangible equity. Needless to say, these businesses remain absolutely strategically important,
and we remain absolutely committed to growing them.
In summary, this was a good set of results. We've had revenue growth from all businesses, but we want to further
increase and broaden revenues, while protecting net interest income. We remain focused on meeting the needs
of our customers through high quality proposition and our multichannel international distribution network.
And as I said at the beginning, I have three focus areas: supporting the businesses to deliver growth and returns,
continuing to generate further efficiencies, and a strict cost and capital discipline. Higher returns in 2023 will give
us substantial distribution capacity in the future. 50% dividend payout ratio has been established for 2023 and
2024. We will return to quarterly dividends from quarter one.
Considerations of buybacks have been brought forward to the quarter one results, and we have signaled a $0.21
per share special dividend as the first priority use of proceeds generated by the planned sale of HSBC Canada,
all followed by increased investment in growth and further buybacks in 2024 and 2025, subject, of course, to
continued strong capital efforts.
With that, I'll ask Richard to take us to Q&A. Thank you very much.

Omar Keenan Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd.
Good morning. It's Omar Keenan from Credit Suisse. Thank you for the presentation. I had questions on net
interest income, please. I was wondering if you could talk us a little bit through how the published rate sensitivities
have changed versus what was published at the interim results. It looks like there's been some quite significant
changes, and it might be impacted by the NII stabilization program that you talked about. So, that would be really
helpful.

And then my second question, just when we think about the recommencement of the buyback, given the good
capital performance, when we think ahead to the first quarter, how should we think about how you'll manage
within the 14% to 14.5% range? Can we consider that any capital generation that lets the group land north of
14.5% might be, say, paid down to the midpoint or something like that? That would be quite helpful. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks, Omar. And let me just give a couple of quick comments on before we go into the detail on rate sensitivity,
just on NII because just to reinforce some of the comments that Georges made. Listen, our guidance is
unchanged quarter to quarter. I think it's important to keep it pretty consistent. But I do want to emphasize what
Georges said. It's at least $36 billion. We do note that consensus is higher than $36 billion. Consensus currently
is around $37 billion. Georges said earlier, we're not looking to move consensus. We're comfortable with where
consensus is.
As Georges said, there are three factors that will play out over the next few weeks and months. And they are
deposit migration, competitive pressures and foreign exchange. That will determine exactly what we mean by at
least. But we'll update on that each quarter. But I just want to reiterate, we're not looking to change consensus
from its current level in the market.
And then on the NII sensitivity or the rate sensitivity, Georges, do you want to just explain how that shift has taken
place?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks, Noel. Thanks, Omar. So, if you look at the downside 100 basis point shift NII sensitivity, we're reporting
now $4 billion. You may have kind of a record of $6 billion previously. The reduction is mainly due to two factors.
Two-third of it is due to the rate level changing. Obviously, the higher the rates, the less you're compressed by the
zero downside challenge. And one-third is due to the additional structural hedging we have started putting on. We
probably expect that one-third proportion to increase as we go forward.
If you look at the upside, the number is $3.5 billion, 100 basis point up. I'd caution you that this number is
somewhat theoretical, i.e., we're assuming 50% betas and no balance sheet change, so no deposit migration, et
cetera. So, we know that the real upside for higher rates will be lower than this, will obviously be higher than
where we are today, but lower than the $3.5 billion addition because you have to factor in a natural deposit
migration and probably higher betas than 50% at the next juncture of rate increases.
On your second question, we're not giving an exact target. We're just stating a range, 14% to 14.5%. We're
leaving it to our judgment and obviously relevant approvals to assess what is excess capital beyond that 14%. But
14.5% is not necessarily the lower bound, right? It's a range and therefore it's not a lower bound at which we
judge excess capital.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 21-Feb-2023
Yes. Good morning. I'm Martin Leitgeb from Goldman Sachs. Could I just have one on NII and one on growth?
And just in terms of net interest margin, a strong progression again quarter-on-quarter both in Hong Kong, so
HBAP and the UK ring-fenced bank. I was just wondering, could you give us a steer on how you think on the
shape of net interest margins on these two core businesses going forward? Should we expect a broad picture of
stability from here in terms of hedge providing further tailwind, hopefully helping to offset migration? And would
you expect the impact of deposit migration to be fairly front-end loaded into 2023 or could this be a longer-term
process?
And secondly on growth, the improved and higher profitability outlook as we head into 2023, a better capital
position and also some of the disposal proceeds from Canada being earmarked for growth and investment. I was
just wondering what growth opportunities are you most excited about and how to square it up with the kind of
guidance for low-single-digit growth this year. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. Let me deal with the second one first and then Georges can come back and add any flavor on deposit
migration. Listen, I think with the economic uncertainty there exists around the world at the moment, I think it is
wise to be cautious on expecting too much underlying growth, particularly, I think, in the demand for term lending
from corporates.
I think they're in a cautionary mode at the moment. So, that's why we're saying we're not expecting in the near
term a significant growth, particularly in the demand for term lending. I still think this growth potential in working
capital finance, trade, a lot will depend on global GDP. That's why we're sort of saying being a little bit more
cautious near term, whilst also seeing once we get through those uncertainties, there'll be growth potential
beyond that.
What I'll also say, though, it's not equal and it's not even. We're seeing a very strong business performance in the
Middle East at the moment. We're seeing good growth there. We're still gaining market share in mortgages.
Granted the market in the UK has shrunk for mortgages, probably around about 30%, but we're still seeking to
grow market share, and we can do so wisely and safely. I'm still seeing very strong business activity levels in
India. It's a strong market with good growth potential.
And Hong Kong is rebounding, not yet translating into, I think, demand for term lending from corporates. But we
are seeing some early signs in January of wealth activity starting to increase as the border with China opened up
and economic activity in Hong Kong opened. That's particularly focused more on investors willing to invest in sort
of the debt markets and structured products rather than equity. I think they're waiting to see how the equity
markets move forward.
And I think China, we delivered $1 billion of profit in China last year, adjusted profit. So, that's a good outcome.
And that was in a tough year. And so, I am expecting economic rebound in China. It will not be unaffected by the
global slowdown. So, I think we're well positioned if there's growth in the world through our Asia franchise, our
international franchise and Middle East. We're well positioned. But it's hard to predict exactly how much growth
will be in the economy. So, we'd rather be a bit cautious.
In terms of linking it to Canada, listen, we've been quite clear in that our preferred use, our prime priority use of
the proceeds of Canada, the first priority use will be a special dividend of $0.21, and I think you can understand
why we're doing that. The cancellation of the dividend for our retail shareholders was a very significant event a
few years ago and we want to try and put that right with the Canada transaction once that closes.

The balance of the rest of the proceeds between retention and buyback, we haven't formed a view on at this point
in time. We'll look at that, at the circumstances when the Canada transaction closes. It will be a combination,
probably a buyback and some retention, but I'm not giving guidance at this stage on what the balance is.
Georges, do you just want to add any further comments on NII? I'm going to reiterate for the avoidance of doubt,
we're not seeking to move guidance on NII. We tend not to give guidance on NIM.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thanks, Noel. Martin, so just a couple of comments that probably will help you figure it out. The first one is deposit
migration and pass-through is already happening, so we are already starting to see it all the way from Q4.
On that point, in Hong Kong, the market tracks deposits and term deposits were substantially below the market,
but we're tracking along kind of directionally same as the market. In the UK, we've already increased our rates
about 7 times, so in the last year, so it kind of reflects this. So, it is already happening.
The second thing I wanted to say is that we haven't seen such speed in rate hikes and such level of rates for a
couple decades now, which means however much we build and evaluate our forecasts on expected customer
behavior and competitive pressures, we don't know. And this is why we wanted to stay somewhat conservative,
but we are conservative for those reasons to assess that. But third, I think this is – many of the proposition we
have in both Hong Kong and the UK since you called out these markets is leading many of our – most of our
customer deposits, our transactions and operating accounts, which means we do expect stronger performance
than what you may see as market's numbers.
The one thing I just want to call out in Hong Kong to be mindful of is HIBOR, which is obviously a leading indicator
of NII performance in Hong Kong has moved all the way to 5.3%, 5.4% and dropped all the way to 2.4%, where I
think is around 2.9% today. There is a short-term headwind on NII due to that. But this is only a – we believe it's
only a short-term headwind due to inflows into Hong Kong and that will resolve itself.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
And I think that's a positive because what's happening in January, what we're seeing is an inflow of capital back
into Hong Kong seeking opportunities for growth. That has temporarily, we believe, suppressed HIBOR a bit. But
it's for a good reason, not a bad reason. Next question.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Aman Rakkar Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
Good morning. It's Aman Rakkar from Barclays. Hi, Noel. Hi, Georges. I've just got a question on revenue, but
principally around non-interest income. I think you're selling yourself a little bit short today around the revenue
guidance. There's a lot of focus on net interest income in the $36 billion guide. But my understanding is that that
includes a much bigger trading interest expense than the kind of numbers you were calling out in Q3.

Q4 2022 Earnings Call 21-Feb-2023
I think you told us to kind of factor in a greater the $1.3 billion drag in 2023, but it looks like that's annualizing
much north of $5 billion. So, it looks like the net interest income that you're calling out has a much bigger negative
in it. And I guess the assumption would be that there would be some positive trading income on that trading
interest expense, which presumably is a big positive for non-interest income. I wouldn't want you to audit my
spreadsheet, but I think I can get to a non-interest income number somewhere between $25 billion and $26
billion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I was going to say an ex-accountant, I don't think you're ever an ex-accountant, but I'm probably not topical, but I
like your double entry. So, yes, there's a double-entry effect and Georges will explain the double entry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
So, your analysis is correct, as a short answer. Just to unpack it a little bit, the earnings from lending to the trading
books in Global Banking and Markets are not booked in NII. They're booked in non-NII due to the accountings.
Those earnings for last year accounted for $2.5 billion in the non-NII line.
Of that $2.5 billion, $1.3 billion was generated in Q4 obviously with the rate level of Q4 with the assumption that
the money – the bank lends to the trading books and Global Banking and Markets stays where it is today and the
rates stay where they are today, then it is not unreasonable to assume you can annualize the Q4 $1.3 billion for
the full year 2023. And, therefore, yes, you will be a couple billion up year-on-year on the non-NII part, which is
related to funding the trading books.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
So a good analysis, fair observation.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Aman Rakkar Q
Analyst, Barclays Capital Securities Ltd.
Thank you very much. I guess, the related question would then be because non-interest income is a messy line. I
know you've got IFRS 17, which you're going to come back to us on, can you help us understand year-on-year
the two big drivers of fee income, I guess, GB&M and Wealth Management? Is your best guess GB&M is up year-
on-year – kind of what's your best take on the kind of underlying fee income in the business year-on-year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Well, first of all, on GB&M, I think we, as probably the markets, have seen a strong level of activity in January, has
been particularly so in the debt capital markets. But we've seen a strong January. Will that sustain through the
year is too early to predict, but good activities, good pipeline.
On Wealth, I said earlier, I think we've seen some early signs of Wealth having a positive January in Hong Kong
in particular. One should assume that positiveness should accelerate, but it's hard to know exactly by what rates.
And I think equities will – equity investment will lag investment in the bond markets and the debt markets. But I
think they are going to be the two drivers.

We got to keep with the fee income growth in Global Payments and foreign exchange and trade. That bedrock
that we've had last year, that's grown around CAGRs of 6%, 7%, 8% per annum for the past three years, will
continue. We're not going to lessen our focus on that, but it should be supplemented by greater levels of activity in
GB&M and in Wealth. Is there anything you want to add or?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
I mean, look, we're not guiding towards fee income, but if you unpack every component of fee income, there's an
area of strategic focus and growth. So, clearly subject to market conditions, you know where our investments are
going. And clearly fee income earning businesses is a key priority, as Noel was indicating earlier, yeah.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Coombs Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
Thank you. It's Andrew Coombs from Citi. I guess I'll carry on working down the P&L, so one on costs and one on
provisions. Previously on the cost guidance, you talked about this $1 billion of cost saves, 3% cost saves, 5%
inflation, net 2%, and now today there's the $300 million severance taking you up to 3% cost growth.
Just thinking more about the medium term, your messaging was no easing up on cost discipline and saves. But
obviously, the severance charges are somewhat lower than the CTA that you booked last year. So, presumably
the attached cost savings are going to be lower than what you had as a tailwind following through into this year.
So, when we think about the cost base in the medium term and the underlying growth run rate, obviously inflation
dependent, but did you see it slightly higher than 3% or do you think 3% is kind of a medium-term run rate?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
We're not giving guidance on 2024 costs at this point in time. I think it's too early. I think we got to see where we
go to on the inflation curve for the rest of the year. There's good progress on inflation, but it's still unpredictable.
On your point, which I do want to come back on, our investment in technology continues. We're now at 20% of our
total cost base in tech. That technology is improving customer propositions, but it's also improving processes,
digitizing processes more and more. We have a long-term program of cost takeout over the future years, 2023,
2024 and 2025, that's already underway.
From the IT investment, that's already embedded in our plan, that would generate cost savings on a recurring
basis as we digitize. So, I don't always need severance to get cost savings because I got IT investment to give me
some cost savings, and that is going to be a continuum. Now, clearly, the more notice you have on that, the more
ability to achieve that without severance, because you can do natural attrition.

Typically, the attrition rate in processing centers and in much of the cost base could be 10%, 15% per annum
attrition. Some places could be as high as 20% per annum attrition. So, you have lead time ability to reposition
your head count without the need for severance as those processes are reengineered. And we're going to be
doing more of that going forward and, therefore, not have to call on things like CTA in the quantum we called on it
in the past three years. And I want to forget CTA. That's now history, and we're just embedding cost savings as
part of the fundamental architecture of the business going forward. Hopefully, that's answered your question on
cost.

Andrew Coombs Q
Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.
It does, indeed. And then on provisions. Thank you for providing the additional disclosure on Chinese commercial
real estate. The $1 billion plausible downside that you provided on the Hong Kong booked Chinese commercial
real estate positions. Just so we have an understanding, you talk about as plausible downside. Is that or isn't that
baked into your overall 40 basis points guidance? Is the 40 bps the base case without that $1 billion, just so we
understand?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Well, let me give you an opening comment and then Georges can add some flavor. Look, we run that plausible
downside as at 31st of December without knowledge or the benefit of the positive policy moves that took place in
January. So, it's a like-for-like. We topped up the provisions. We thought the provisions were appropriate.
We decided to do some scenario analysis. That's the result of the scenario analysis. We didn't think that scenario
required to be provided against or we would have put it in the balance sheet. We decided that was not required.
We had sufficient coverage, but we wanted to run a scenario that said, what is the plausible downside if things
continue to get worse? And that scenario has existed in Q4, continued into 2023.
Since then, positive measures have happened, particularly the provision of liquidity to the offshore market and the
rebooting of the China economy post-COVID. That you could argue in my terminology as changed the dynamics
of that plausible downside, either the probability of it or the quantum of it. But we've not rerun it. It is what it was at
31st of December. And what we try to give you is a scoping of what could happen if things continued the way they
were.
Now, I'm not going to answer the question, is it in the 40 basis points or isn't in the 40 basis points. We feel
comfortable whether it's looking at the global economy, our UK business, our Hong Kong business, China,
commercial real estate. We're guiding you to an overall bad debt, an ECL charge of around 40 basis points, the
composition of which we're not going to blow out into any finer detail. But to the extent it's not needed for China
real estate for that plausible downside, it gives us more cover elsewhere.
So, like, is there anything I should – you want to add Georges?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
No, no. I think Noel covered it exactly. I mean just kind of to be very clear, it is a downside. It is not a forecast.
We're very comfortable where we are now in terms of provisioning. And we have not factored $1 billion in the 40
basis points. So, it's not – so again, this is a downside.

I think just kind of zooming in on one thing. We've given you a grid to be able to do your own assessment. We
have our own views on ECLs and China real estate and the outlook and how the sector could evolve. But we've
unpacked the portfolio in a way that allows you to do your own scenario. So, you know what, we've classified the
sub-impaired – sub-standard and credit impaired. And that's 60% of the offshore portfolios as quite – we've taken
quite a robust view there.
You've seen the level of provisions we associated. If you wanted to increase an ECL coverage, you can come up
with an equivalent scenario and you can kind of land on that plausible downside by just making your own
assumptions about loss given default on this subset of the portfolio.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Guy Stebbings Q
Analyst, Exane BNP Paribas
Hi. Morning. Afternoon. Thanks very much for taking the questions. Firstly, on net interest income and then a sort
of quick follow-up on impairments. Just in sort of Hong Kong specifically, it's good NII management in the quarter,
but you're flagging sort of further negative deposit mix, [ph] HIBOR drifted lower (01:03:20), and lending
conditions have been subdued. Just want to get a sense if you think NII in Hong Kong specifically should rise from
Q1 run rate or whether we're kind of capped out there. We need HIBOR to really [ph] wreak up (01:03:31) with US
rates to get NII to move from the Q4 run rate.
And sort of linked to that, in terms of deposit mix and deposit beta in your two largest markets, Hong Kong and
UK, you're obviously further ahead in that journey in Hong Kong. Is the guidance from here predicated on a
greater headwind coming in Hong Kong or UK when you think about deposit mix and beta specifically?
And then just a quick follow-up on impairments, you've nudged up the guidance and now expect to be above
normalized. But appreciate your comments just now that you don't want to get into all the detail in terms of
composition there, but I just wondered if you can share any color on which markets do you think there's a bit more
of a risk about being above normalized cost of risk, or put it another way, any markets you're incrementally more
cautious since Q3 results? Thank you.

Georges, do you want to take it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Sure. Thank you, Guy. So, on Hong Kong deposits, first, the hyper impact we believe is short term-ish and this is
a correction, as Noel was explaining earlier. But you also have to look at what additional deposits this may mean
for us. So, we're looking at this – obviously, it's a headwind for NII. It's certainly a tailwind for the economic
outlook of Hong Kong, its growth, and the capability of growing the overall deposit and loan pool. So, this is why
we're yet to really seeing how the impact of the short-term HIBOR is going to be.

In terms of deposit mix, and this is valid for both Hong Kong, UK deposit mix and betas, this is happening already,
as I did say. We are substantially better than the market averages that are reported. Due to the nature of the
deposits we have, they are mostly operating in transaction deposits and we already factored in our guidance the
fact that we will see additional or continuation of these migrations taking place. So, we're very mindful that it will
happen and we're factoring it in.
The level of uncertainty we have is how much more or less vis-à-vis our own guidance is going to have. In the UK,
as I said earlier, we've already increased rates 7 times. You should expect that any 100 basis point higher from
here will see marginally higher betas than the one we experienced before. But that's just the nature of how your
pass-through rates will work both for us and for the rest of the market. And that's exactly also how we are
factoring in our guidance.
On the ECL risk, do you want to take?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah. I'll cover it. I mean, the ECL risk, listen, the obvious market that you maybe would ask questions on is the
UK. We've talked a lot about China real estate, the obvious, and I've already said the South and Southeast Asia is
performing well. Middle East is performing well. We have principally in Europe an international wholesale
corporate book and in the US an international wholesale corporate book, so not exposed to retail credit pressures
there. So, that brings you to the UK. And I'd say on the UK at the moment, we're not seeing any signs of stress at
the moment of any significance outside of normality in UK retail banking. I think it's performing well. The mortgage
book is holding up well. I'm not seeing any major signs of stress in our book.
I'm not saying the market isn't stressed, but I think in our book, we're comfortable. And we're much smaller in
unsecured lending than many of our UK competitors. But, again, we're not seeing any major signs of stress in the
UK unsecured book, retail unsecured book. It is fair to say that UK corporates, particularly smaller corporates to
middle market corporates, the inflationary pressures are having a negative impact on cash flow. But, again, I'd say
that's marginal deterioration in our book at the moment. It's not material deterioration. It's understandable
pressures. So, we're not seeing that turning the corner into very negative territory at all at the moment.
Now, we'll have to see how that plays out for the rest of the year. But if I look at the 40 basis points and you look
at the pockets of where there are potential ECL charges could come from, we've given you a view on China real
estate that says there's still a way to go for the UK, China real estate market to get back to a level of normality,
but it's turned the corner and it's in positive territory, but there's still some way to go. So, there's some potential
usage of the 40 basis points there.
There's some potential usage of the 40 basis points in the UK, but at the moment, it would be normal usage levels
in the UK, which may be some possibly slightly higher usage levels in smaller to mid-market corporates, but it's
marginal at the moment. And then the rest of the world, I'd put in normal to positive territory. Middle East is
experiencing a very strong economy at the moment. So, I'd say you could argue our normal range is between 30
and 40 basis points. We're trying to be a bit more cautious and position you at 40 basis points because of the
uncertainty in the world.

impact of the severance and the normalization of the UK bank levy, and I strip out the $1 billion of flow-through
from previous cost savings, I think that sort of 3% becomes more like an underlying 4% to 5%. Please correct me
if you disagree. But my question would be, is 4% to 5% a fair sort of view of what the underlying sort of cost
pressures are as we go into 2024 before any further incremental cost savings that may or may not come through,
bearing in mind that...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Nice try to get me to give you updated guidance on 2024. But I'm not going to. The one thing I will reiterate for
you, though, it's just to help. We have programs running that are part of business as usual through digitization,
through technology, through simplification, process reengineering that you should expect that we will always have
an element of cost savings coming through as part of continuing to drive efficiency.
And I will use some of those cost savings to mitigate some of the inflationary impacts that exist in the
environment. But I'm not going to quantify that trade-off between inflation and constant reengineering. But I think
you're wrong to assume in your arithmetic that you just had that we've stopped trying to drive efficiency through.
We will always try to drive some level of efficiency into the cost base as a mitigant against some of the inflationary
pressures. So, I wouldn't flow it all the way through necessarily into your models as a one-for-one calculation. But
I'm not giving guidance at the moment on 2024 or 2025 other than cost discipline remains a core.
Georges, do you want to add anything?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Yeah, just want to just make sure you get the numbers right. So, the bank levy benefit, i.e., the credits is a 2022
benefit. We have said we are expecting normalization of the bank levy to circa $200 million for 2023. And this is
already baked into our cost guidance. So, we're not getting – the benefit has kind of past. It's in the 2022 1%
number already. And we banked it, renew it. And therefore for 2023, you should strip it out. It's already in our cost
guidance.
The second one is the cost saving flow-through will manifest this year in additional pay-related inflation of the
overall pay pool. Again, as Noel indicated, when you're looking beyond 2023, you have to assess how inflation
outlook is during the course of 2023. We think the outlook is improving and we think we've already baked into our
pay the effect of the inflation that we've suffered, including some double-digit jurisdiction inflation, et cetera. So,
that's not necessarily a repeat beyond 2023, at least not to the same extent.
But I also want to just clarify the hyperinflation impact on cost is not budgeted. We do not – in our view, this is not
a real cost growth. This is just an arithmetic growth that comes from rebasing prior year costs under our constant

currency reporting. So, therefore, we have not planned for it. We cannot manage it. We do not think this is – or
we're not – our view is this is not real cost growth and we have not factored in. So, just a clarification there.

We got time for two more questions only, I'm afraid. Manus and Jason from the lines, and then Noel will wrap up.
So, over to next question from Manus, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Manus, your line is now open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manus Costello Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Hi. It's Manus Costello from Autonomous. Thanks, Richard. Just wanted to – a couple of questions, please.
Firstly, to follow up on Aman's question. You confirmed that there is over $2 billion of year-on-year benefit into
non-interest income from the [indiscernible] (01:13:54). And I think you had about $1 billion or over $1 billion of
[ph] hits on non-interest income about this year mark-to-markets, insurance, et cetera (01:13:58). So, you've
already said consensus NII doesn't need to change. [ph] But if I just piece NII not changing and (01:14:07)...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Many apologies. That's a bad line. We'll take the caller's contact details. We'll move to the next
question and it comes from John Napier (sic) [Jason Napier] of UBS.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jason Napier Q
Analyst, UBS AG (London Branch)
[indiscernible] (01:14:26). The first one just focusing on the United States business and sort of what's left of the
North American franchise ex-Mexico, loan portfolio is really small, sort of $54 billion and the deposit book's about
[ph] $100 billion (01:14:40), I appreciate a lot of the business originated out of that region probably is booked
elsewhere. But I just wondered in terms of the overhead that resides in that jurisdiction, the 75% cost-income that
was delivered there last year, how you think about that and whether that's appropriately scaled for the shape of
the business going forward?
And then secondly, Manus' question is a good one. So, I hope we do get back to that. The second question for
me would be on the capital walk, quite a lot of noise in the deductions in Q4. I just wanted to invite you perhaps to
call out any sort of changes from the Q4 end of period levels that we've got for things like DTAs and expected
losses and so on. Is there anything to flag in terms of headwinds to capital following a very good print at the full
year stage? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Georges, do you want to take both of those?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Sure. So, first, the cost-income ratio for North America, as Noel indicated, we're looking at the overall value of the
franchise. We're looking at the business generated or the income generated by those customers sitting in North
America, but booked specifically in the East Asia and the Middle East. So, therefore, we're not commenting or
managing specific legal entity's cost-income ratio. We will look at the profitability of clients and we will look at the

profitability of business lines and the returns of clients and the returns of business lines when we make these
assessments.
On the capital walk, no – so first, DTAs have been deducted from capital, at least the UK DTA, which was the
substantial one, is gone a significant item and therefore not in capital and is also deducted from the dividend
payout ratio. Other DTAs fall under the threshold deductions and get deducted. I don't think there's anything to
worry about that, it's just a natural walk.
So, therefore, I don't think we have any headwinds on capital as we go into Q1. It's just about the impacts of profit
generation, the impacts of RWA growth for our CET1 ratio. I may call it out here just to make sure that I put your
minds at ease if this is coming through. Any impairment in BoCom sitting under significant holdings, if it were to
be needed will result in virtually no CET1 ratio impact again due to those capital deductions. And therefore would
result into no impact on our dividend payout and no impact to our share buyback – any share buyback program
that may be running at such time of an impairment. Yeah. So, I hope I answered your question, but if there's
something specific you would like to address, we can take it as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Also, just on the US, I just want to say that Michael and the team in the US have done a great job in rationalizing
the portfolio. A lot of the actions they've taken in 2022 would have a full year benefit in 2023. So, I do expect the
cost efficiency ratio of the US to come down from actions already taken. And he still sees further opportunities to
rationalize the cost base of the US. So, I think you'll see that ratio come down over time as you start to see full
year cost savings benefits hit into 2023. But he's done a great job in repositioning that portfolio over the past two
to three years.

Richard O'Connor A

Manus, dial back on. Let's give...

Manus?

Yeah. Let's try Manus again please to see if the line has got better.

Noel Quinn A
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
It is. Thank you, Manus.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manus Costello Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Okay. Apologies for earlier. Yeah, I just wanted – since Jason liked the question, I thought I'd try again. So, it was
following up on the previous point about the revenue guidance. There is at least $2 billion of benefit year-over-
year on non-interest income from the trading book impact. There are about $1 billion of one-off hits in non-interest
income in 2022. And you've already said that net interest income, you're happy with consensus being unchanged.
So, when I look at the revenue guidance for the year, it strikes me that – or the revenue consensus for the year, I
should say, it strikes me the revenue consensus is at least a couple of billion too low. I wondered if you were able
to comment on that because there's some confusion, I think, that there is a revenue downgrade coming out of this
set of earnings, which based on the comments you've made so far on this call doesn't seem to me to be right
conclusion? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Georges Elhedery A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Thank you, Manus. So, your analysis is correct. The first one is there is indeed a couple billion that you need to
factor in in the non-NII due to the funding of the trading book, assuming roughly flat balances and flat rates
throughout 2023 to the Q4 number. So, yes, that one is correct.
The second one is, yes, fee income has been subdued in 2022, particularly in Wealth. And we explained the
situation in Hong Kong earlier as well as in the capital markets and advisory activities in Global Banking and
Markets. Both of which do seem to reverse, at least the first month of this year has been much more optimistic.
We've seen resumption of activity in Wealth.
Now, I can't comment on the quantum of the reversal of that lost income last year. But, yeah, your assessment is
fair. Now, all in all, I cannot guide to non-NII, but I think the ingredients you have here are fair to be used.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard O'Connor
Global Head-Investor Relations, HSBC Holdings Plc
With that, we better wrap up. Back to Noel to sum up, please.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Noel Quinn
Group Chief Executive & Director, HSBC Holdings Plc
Well, thank you very much for all of your questions and your time. To close with a few comments, we've
completed the first phase of our transformation. Our international connectivity remains our greatest strength, and
it's now underpinned by good, broad-based profit generation. That's a powerful combination. You can see it in the
strong delivery in 2022. We've also got a tight grip on costs, and we're on track to deliver our returns target.
But there's so much more we can do. We're well positioned to further improve growth and returns, and we expect
to have substantial distribution capacity for dividends, buybacks, and potentially a special dividend in early 2024.
Richard and the team are available to you if you have any further questions. But in the meantime, have a good
afternoon or morning, and thank you for being with us.
