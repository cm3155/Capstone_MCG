Good morning, and thank you for joining the call. The second quarter was another strong quarter in which we
achieved net income of $218 million. Our results reflect the continued rebound in economic activity and the

unprecedented level of federal stimulus. They also reflect our diversified sources of revenue and prudent risk
management.
Please turn to slide 3. Our current net income of $218 million was $45 million lower than the first quarter and $90
million higher than the same quarter of 2020. The quarter-over-quarter variance was driven by a lower benefit in
the provision for credit losses compared to last quarter, higher revenues and lower expenses. The increase in net
interest income was driven by higher income from our investment portfolio and lower deposit costs. Our non-
interest income increased due to higher volume of credit and debit card transaction. Credit quality trends were
positive in the quarter with lower NPLs and net recoveries.
During the quarter, we continue to return capital to our shareholders. In late April, we entered into a $350 million
accelerated share repurchase program. And on July 1, we paid a dividend of $0.45 per common share an
increase of $0.05.
Please turn to slide 4 for an update on various business metrics. Our customer base in Puerto Rico continues to
grow, increasing by $17,000 in the second quarter and by nearly $30,000 in year-to-date to reach more than $1.9
million unique customers. Adoption of digital channels among our retail customers continues to be strong. Active
users on our Mi Banco platform exceeds 1.1 million and have grown by 18% since March 2020.
We captured 66% of our deposits in the second quarter through digital channels. As expecting, these trends have
adjusted slightly lower compared to the levels seen over the past year, but remains significantly higher than pre-
pandemic levels.
With respect to the PPP program, we funded nearly 50,000 loans totaling $2.1 billion across both rounds. We
originated more than 29,000 loans or $1.4 billion in the round one and nearly 21,000 loans or $678 million in
round two. In Puerto Rico we funded 62% of all PPP loans that were originated on the island. Of the loans
originated in round one close to $965 million or 68% have been forgiven as of the end of June.
Within Popular's clientele, the dollar value of credit and debit card sales have continued to trend higher,
increasing by 17% compared to last quarter and by 45% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Auto loan and
lease originations at BPPR increased by 8% in the second quarter compared to the first quarter and by 32%
compared to the second quarter of 2019.
Similarly, we have continued strength in the housing market. The dollar volume of mortgage originations at Banco
Popular increased by 6% compared to last quarter and by 63% compared to the second quarter of 2019.
Please turn to slide 5 for an update on the current macro environment in Puerto Rico. In the second quarter
business trends and customer activity continue to improve, building upon the momentum seen in recent quarters
as most of the COVID-related restrictions that were in place have been either relaxed or eliminated. Puerto Rico
has continued to make solid progress on the vaccination front. According to the CDC website 1.9 million or 66%
of the population over 12 years old had been vaccinated, and 2.2 million or 76% of the population over 12 years
old have received at least one dose.
New auto sales continue to reflect strong consumer demand with sales of more than 35 units in the second
quarter. Year-to-date auto sales have more than doubled compared to the first six months of 2020 and are up
31% from the same period in 2019.

Cement sales have remained strong. Year-to-date sales of cement were higher than the level of sales that were
seen during the last – during the same time period in 2018 and 2019 when the island was rebuilding following the
2017 hurricanes.
The improvement in the tourism and hospitality sector has been extraordinary. With much of the world travel still
somewhat limited, Puerto Rico continues to be a popular destination for mainland residents that have become
more comfortable with traveling. Additionally, earlier this month, the CDC improved its assessment of the risk of
contracting COVID in Puerto Rico to Level 2 or moderate. This action should help further stimulate travel to the
island. Wholesale demand has picked up dramatically. In June, occupancy rates in Puerto Rico were nearly 79%.
Additionally, the revenue per available room reached $216, the highest level on record and compares to $129 in
June of 2019.
Airport traffic has continued to improve at a rapid pace. Year-to-date passenger traffic is 75% higher than last
year and is down only 6% compared to 2019. In the month of June, traffic was up 372% compared to the same
month a year ago and was 14% higher than in June 2019. In fact, June was the highest level of passenger traffic
seen at the airport since it was privatized in 2013.
Cruise ships are now scheduled to recommence arrivals during the first week of August. Employment levels have
improved, but are still below pre-pandemic levels. Total non-farm employment has increased by 2% since
December 2020 and by 7% since June 2020.
We are extremely pleased with the results for the second quarter. We continue to be very optimistic about the
economic recovery, but will remain attentive to how the evolving health situation may impact the economic
outlook.
I now turn the call over to Carlos for more details on our financial results.

Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Thank you, Ignacio. Good morning. Please turn to slide 6. As usual, additional information is provided in the
appendix to the slide deck. Today's earnings press release details variances from the first quarter.
Net interest income for the second quarter was $488 million, an increase of $9 million from Q1 driven by
increased balances in the investment portfolio and lower deposit cost. Non-interest income increased by $1
million to $155 million in Q2.
Contributing to these results were higher credit card interchange fees of $4 million plus $2.4 million higher net
earnings from investments held under the equity method along with various other smaller positive variances. This
is almost entirely offset by $9.9 million lower mortgage banking income primarily due to a negative quarter-over-
quarter variance in MSR valuations of $6.8 million versus a positive variance of $9.2 million in Q1.
The provision for the second quarter was a benefit of $17 million. This was $65 million lower than the $82 million
benefit recorded in the first quarter. Lidio will expand on credit-related matters.
Total operating expenses were $368 million in the quarter, down $7 million from Q1. The decrease was primarily
due to lower employee compensation cost by $5 million, mostly driven by seasonality of compensation plans and
lower other operating expenses by $4 million, primarily due to a reserve release on our mortgage servicing

business. These were partially offset by higher customer reward program expense of $3 million, resulting from
increased credit card transactions as well as slightly higher advertising costs.
For the full year 2021, we now expect our average quarterly expenses to be $380 million to $385 million, $5
million per quarter higher than our prior estimate. A number of factors contributed to this increase. We expect
compensation expense to be higher due to continued business outperformance as well as increased competition
for talent. Some projects and activities that were delayed in the first half of the year should materialize in the
second half. And finally, we also expect higher processing and technology costs.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25% compared to 23% in the first quarter. This increase was primarily
due to a higher proportion of taxable income in Puerto Rico. For 2021, we now expect our effective tax rate to be
between 22% and 25%, which is an increase from our prior range of 20% to 24%.
Please turn to slide 7. NII on a taxable equivalent basis was $541 million, $11 million higher than in the first
quarter. The primary drivers of the increase were higher interest income from the investment portfolio by $13
million due to a $4.4 billion increase in average balances, lower deposit cost by $2 million and an additional $4
million of income due to one more day in the quarter.
Deposits grew by $5.9 billion in the quarter. This increase was spread across all business lines. The majority of
the growth was in Puerto Rico government deposits. But, similar to Q1, our retail and commercial deposits
increased by $1.9 billion.
NIM decreased by 16 basis points to 2.91% in Q2. On a taxable equivalent basis, NIM was 3.22%, a decrease of
17 basis points. The lower margin is due to asset mix, meaning higher balances of low-yielding money market
and investment securities.
The total loan yield decreased by 2 basis points in Q2 as a result of lower PPP related income of $13.9 million
compared to $23.1 million in the first quarter. PPP loans yielded approximately 4.45% this quarter compared to
7.21% last quarter. The reduction in yield was due to slower accelerated recognition of fee income upon
forgiveness. The remaining unamortized portion of fees for the PPP portfolio is approximately $60 million.
We believe most of the remaining $354 million first round PPP loans will be forgiven during the third and fourth
quarters of this year and a majority of the $670 million second round PPP loans by the middle of next year. We
expect margin will continue to drop in Q3 due to continued high levels of deposits, but should recover towards the
year-end. The ultimate result will depend on our asset mix and the rate of forgiveness of PPP loans.
As of the end of the second quarter, Puerto Rico public deposits were roughly $19 billion, an increase of just over
$4 billion from last quarter. These balances reflect the most recent CARES Act federal stimulus including
assistance to state and local governments. We continue to expect public deposit balances to come down over
time driven by outlays of funds advanced from the CARES and JOBS Act, the restructuring of public sector debt,
and their return to current debt service.
Our ending loan balances decreased by $69 million in the quarter. This decline was due to a $224 million decline
in PPP loans partially offset by an increase of $139 million in the auto and leased portfolio. First round PPP loans
dropped by $418 million while second round disbursements were approximately $192 million. Excluding the
impact of PPP, loan balances grew by $170 million. We continue to see strong demand and net portfolio growth in
auto loans and leases while other loan portfolios are either flat or have decreased since the first quarter. We
expect loan balances will continue to be impacted by PPP forgiveness as well as limited demand resulting from

unprecedented levels of clients' liquidity. As such, we do not expect overall long growth to materialize until next
year when the demand resulting from expected economic growth should outpace forgiveness of PPP loans.
Please turn to slide 8. Our capital levels remain strong relative to mainland peers and well capitalized regulatory
requirements. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio in Q2 was 16.6% down 60 basis points from Q1 primarily due to
capital actions. In April, the corporation entered into a $350 million accelerated share repurchase transaction. As
a result, recognizing shareholders equity approximately $280 million interest-free stock and $70 million as a
reduction of capital surplus. The final accounting treatment for the program will depend on the average price of
the stock during the term of the ASR scheduled to close in Q3. Our EPS in Q2 increased by $0.08 because of this
transaction.
We will continue to explore opportunities to manage our capital during the remainder of 2021 and in future
periods. However, we do not expect further dividend increases or common stock repurchases this year.
We have returned to our normal capital planning schedule this year hopefully resulting in an announcement of
Popular's 2022 capital actions no later than our January 2022 webcast. Our stockholders' equity decreased in the
quarter primarily due to the impact of the $350 million ASR. However, our tangible book value per share
increased by $1.82 to $63.24. This increase was driven by our quarterly net income higher cumulative unrealized
gains on investments and a lower share count. Our return on tangible equity was 17.6% in the second quarter.
With that, I turn the call over to Lidio.

Thank you, Carlos, and good morning. During the second quarter, the corporation continued to exhibit strong
credit quality metrics and low credit costs driven by the improving economic environment. Please turn to slide
number 9 to discuss credit metrics.
Non-performing assets decreased by $7 million to $777 million this quarter mainly driven by an NPL decrease of
$13 million offset in part by an increase of $5 million in NPLs held for sale. In Puerto Rico NPLs decreased by $9
million, mainly due to lower mortgage NPLs of $20 million resulting from lower inflows and continued
improvements in early in multi trends, coupled with lower consumer NPLs mainly in the regulatory. These
decreases were offset in part by higher commercial NPLs of $17 million mainly due to the inflow from a single $32
million non-COVID related clients. This increase was offset in part by the resolution of a $9 million NPL
relationship that resulted in a significant recovery.
In the US, NPLs decreased by $4 million mostly related to a construction loan transferred to held for sale. The
ratio of NPLs to total loans held in portfolio was 2.4% flat versus the prior quarter.
Please turn to slide number 10 to discuss NPL inflows. Compared to the first quarter NPL inflows excluding
consumer loans increased by $11 million, driven by an increase of $17 million in Puerto Rico, mainly due to the
previously mentioned commercial relationship. This increase was offset in part by lower mortgage NPL inflows of
$15 million. In the US NPL inflows decreased by $6 million as the prior quarter included a $12 million construction
loan that reached 90 days to its renewal process was current at the end of the quarter.
Turning to slide number 11, net charge-offs amounted to a net recovery of $1.3 million for annualized negative 2
basis points of average loans held in portfolio compared to net charge-offs of $21 million or 29 basis points in the
previous quarter.

The results for the quarter was aided by the recovery of $7.9 million related to the resolution of the above
mentioned non-performing relationship. Excluding this, the net charge off ratio would have been [audio gap]
(00:19:54-00:20:57) healthy portfolio decreased to 2.7% from 2.75% in the prior quarter. Excluding payment
protection program loans and guaranteed mortgage loans, this ratio is 3.02%. The ratio of allowance for credit
losses to NPL held in portfolio was 115%, flat to the prior quarter.
Please turn to slide number 12 to discuss details on the drivers of the variance in our allowance for credit losses.
The allowance for credit losses decreased by $15 million when compared to the previous quarter. Variances were
driven by changes to qualitative research and economic outlook as well as portfolio credit quality and mix. While a
strong recovery is evident we also consider more adverse – adverse outcomes even uncertainties around the
impact of the new virus strains and the Puerto Rico government's ability to utilize available cellular treatments. As
a result we continue to assign a high probability to the baseline scenario followed by the more pessimistic best
three scenarios.
Our macroeconomic forecast uses a number of economic variables with the unemployment rate and GDP being
the largest drivers. The current baseline scenarios shows a slight improvement in both 2021 GDP growth and
unemployment rates when compared to the previous estimates. However, revisions to historical macroeconomic
indicators conducted by the Puerto Rico Planning Board contributed to increases in the allowance for credit
losses in Puerto Rico. These revisions caused ACL to increase by $21 million.
During the quarter we released $10 million from our qualitative research prompted by the economic environment
and improvements in borrower performance. Total Popular changes caused ACL to decrease by $27 million,
portfolio changes include fluctuations in credit quality, volume, and mix.
To summarize, our loan portfolio exhibited improved credit quality metrics during the second quarter, aided by the
government stimulus and an improving economic environment. We will continue to monitor the exposure of the
portfolios to pandemic-related risk and changes in the economic outlook.
With that I would like to turn the call over to Ignacio for his concluding remarks. Thank you.

Thank you, Lidio and Carlos, for your update. Our results for the first half of 2021 were strong, driven by solid
earnings, improved credit quality, record deposit levels, continued consumer growth and our capital actions. We
are optimistic about the economic outlook.
In addition to the unprecedented level of federal stimulus related to COVID, Puerto Rico still has a significant
amount of hurricane recovery funds that have yet to be disbursed, which we expect will now start flowing at a
faster pace. The combined impact of these factors and improved consumer confidence should generate
considerable economic activity in many sectors for the coming years, and we are well-positioned to benefit from
such activity.
We are looking forward to having the entire team together in our office again. Even progress in the vaccination
process, a general improvement in health conditions and sound safety protocols in our facilities, we will begin to
bring back to the office our colleagues that are still working remotely. Managers and supervisors will be returning
in mid-August and the remainder of our workforce will return after Labor Day. We will however be offering eligible
employees a hybrid work arrangement.

Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Hi there, good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Morning, Brock.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Could you talk more about loan growth and what you see? I think, Carlos, you're very clear, you're not expecting
growth until next year. I guess, I'm trying to put together what appears to be multiple economic data points
pointing toward a resurgence of economic growth and the lack of it in the loan book. Maybe if you talk about
utilization or origination pipelines, anything that could kind of help us triangulate? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Sure, well, the first comment on loan growth is that I think our bankers are doing a pretty good job originating
loans. If you take out the effect of PPP in this quarter we actually grew loans by a $130 million. So that's a nice
start.
The reason we keep pointing to net loan growth in 2022 is that even though our bankers are doing a pretty good
job, we still have number one clients with very high levels of liquidity. And the average commercial and retail client
of Popular their average balance has grown by more than 40% since February of last year. So our average client
has a significant amount of liquidity in their accounts.
And the other is just a normal flow of our business. If you think – assume for a moment, Brock, that the PPP1,
whatever is left of it which is $350 million, goes away by year end that's probably in the right ballpark. We have
our old Western Bank portfolio that amortizes about $25 million a quarter, so that's another $50 million. And the
8

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
normal amortization schedule of our mortgage books is this is so large despite the fact that our origination is doing
very well. It's still a negative number. It's probably in excess of $100 million a quarter.
So when you take those three pieces along, there's a lot of other moving pieces obviously. You have a portfolio
that on their natural flow alone will come back – come down about $500 million. So if our bank has bang up job,
they make that up, but the net growth they have to make that up and then do some more. So the reason we are
still thinking about 2022 is a combination of clients with a significant amount of liquidity and the fact that we still
have to overcome the natural runoff of, of our book. Now this is one in which we hope we're wrong. I hope the
growth shows up earlier than that. But I think that our best guess right now is that when these balances start
going the other way will probably be early 2022.

Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Appreciate that color. And anything under the hood in terms of loan efforts to open new lines of credit on
the C&I side that haven't been drawn yet as a result of some of the economic pickup we're seeing?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
I think we – the activity – so, it's Ignacio. The activity we're seeing is pretty normal. I think many of our clients as
Carlos said, many of our existing clients have existing lines. The one area I would say you probably see more
activity is you are seeing more I think investor interest in Puerto Rico again. So, I think we're seeing more new
activity like acquisition loans or finding business or buying properties, more than lines of credit because most of
our commercial clients like I said have plenty of liquidity and they have available lines. So, they don't really need
new lines. But we are seeing more and more activity on the acquisition front.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
Carlos, coming back to the liquidity comment you were making about your customers. Can we tie that to the
deposit growth as well ex the government deposit growth? What do you think is driving that liquidity. Is it primarily
the stimulus programs meaning PPP, and then from a consumer side the stimulus checks? Or is there something
else going on in addition to that – that is driving that liquidity and therefore you're still seeing these nice deposit
levels or higher deposit level?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
This is Ignacio. I think there is no doubt that the stimulus payment had a big effect. I mean a lot of money came
directly into people's accounts and they didn't spend at all. I also think that, for a while, people didn't have the
ability to really spend their money; they couldn't travel, they couldn't do other things, they weren't commuting, so
they saved on gas. So, there was a number of things that people, I think, were building up liquidity.
So I would expect that, going forward, that liquidity build is not going to continue because this was a special
period. But there's still a lot of money in the bank to actually to my surprise. You hear a lot of stories about people
buying cars and refrigerators and, by the way, we know they're doing that, but they still have money in the bank.

Carlos J. Vázquez A

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Go ahead, Carlos. Sorry.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. You can actually see the client activities continue to go up when you look at our – the usage of our debit
and credit cards. So they are continuing to spend that money, but it will probably take them a few months before.
The other interesting thing to think about is remember that when a client spends money – when a retail client
spends the money they have in their account with us there's a better than not chance that that becomes the
deposit in the commercial accounts of clients of us.
So there is a circular effect that some, while their money is moving you may not see a net reduction in our deposit
balance simply because it's moving back and forth. Now, the flip side of that is also true. If the client spends the
money in Walmart it goes to the states, right. So it's a combination of things. But there is a little bit of flow here
that goes from one type of account to another too.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And when your line officers or when you guys go out and talk to your clients, is there any
determination yet that because of what we have come through and now they have these higher levels of liquidity,
could this be permanent where – let's say, like your auto dealers, you're obviously very big in the auto business.
Are they going to just run with lower inventory levels permanently and just use higher margins? Any sense of that
yet that this could be a permanent shift and not something temporary?

Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
No, I – well, I could tell you I had been getting out more and seeing clients. I haven't heard that. I mean I think
inventory levels are relatively low in large part because they can't get more inventory. But I don't think that's going
to happen. I think once the market levels off again, there are going to be very competitive pressures for people to
reduce their margins. I don't – I think it'll level set. I also expect, I mean, many of our clients went through a
difficult period where liquidity was king, right, when you're in a tough situation. So I think they will hold more
liquidity probably if you think about the experience [indiscernible] (00:34:15).
But, also, I think they're waiting to see to this recovery take hold. And then many of them will decide whether they
need to invest and expand. And that's why I think Carlos was saying we expect to see more loan growth later on
because people are not going to want to miss business. So, right now, they're stretching their capacity to generate
the demand that's there. At some point, they're going to have to increase their capacity, not just stretch it. So
that's what we are waiting for.

Very good. And then as a follow up question maybe this is for Lidio. The large credit that went on nonaccrual this
quarter, if you could maybe give us some color what caused that to go on and what type of credit it is. And then
second, I think you also mentioned that a large construction loan that was 90 days past due in the first quarter
went back to performing status. Maybe some color on how you did that.
And then the third part of the question, in your outlook for the allowance, I noticed that in the first quarter baseline,
the unemployment rate assumption in Puerto Rico for 2021 was 8%. And now in the second quarter, the baseline
unemployment rate is 8.4%, which I found odd considering all the positive economic trends we are hearing about
in Puerto Rico. So, if you don't mind if you could address those questions. Thank you.

As we mentioned in the last webcast, this was a relationship that, while in the renewal process, went past the 90
days maturity and, therefore given our policy, we entered into non-accrual. But it was refinanced within or
restructured within at the end of the quarter. So, that's why I went back to being current. So, it was also to some
extent, let's call it, administrative or technical delinquencies.
And then, as it relates to the unemployment rate, as you know, as you are aware, we use Moody's services to
estimate unemployment. I think when you look at the baseline, even though it is true that it went up in 2021, it
actually went down in 2022. So, overall, when you look overall unemployment rate for Puerto Rico for the whole –
the recent [indiscernible] (00:37:14) period, it actually went down. That's why we mentioned are looking at an
economic forecast from quarter-to-quarter, was a slight improvement from one to the other.

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
I just wanted to go back to some of the different components of loan growth expectations. It's my understanding
there's some rather large construction projects potentially being sponsored somewhat by the CDBG money that
potentially could come online in the next couple of quarters, and you see disbursements that could, I don't know,
potentially meaningfully impact construction loan balances across the banks. And obviously I would expect you
guys to get more than your fair share of that. Can you talk about some of those projects and the expectations for
the timings for some of those disbursements and whether that's something that we can expect this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. This is Ignacio. So yes, that the FEMA process is quite complicated, so there's a large number of public
projects they're going to be done. And they run across a gambit of some that'll be done by the state such as
roads, the highway authority; some that will be through PREPA which is now LUMA will handle the funds; some
will be Aqueduct and Sewer Authority; and some will be the municipality.
I always tell people that 2021 is the year where you're not going to see a lot of disbursements because although
FEMA has finally approved and signed off on the budgets for many of these projects and have assigned an
amount, they still have to go through the design process, they have to go through a permanent process and that –
and they have to sign a construction contract.
All that requires bidding through FEMA. So in terms of the federal fund, I think 2021 is more a prefatory sort of
stage. I don't think we'll see big dollars. There'll be dollars going out because obviously there'll be dollars going
out to architects and people that are working on that. And some of the smaller scale municipal projects you'll see
outlaid. But I think the big projects you're not going to see big outlays until 2022 just because that's the way the
process works. It's a lengthy process, it requires bidding in every stage. You have to bid for the architectural work.
You have to bid for the construction work, you have to permit. Unfortunately in Puerto Rico we probably do not set
the gold standard for the permitting process. So that complicates everything.
So I don't think, in private sector you will see more home. I think residential construction, the residential
construction market is very hot. That takes time. Again, you've got to find the land, you've got to get the permits.
But I think it definitely – we have seen not only in the public side but I think you are going to see in the private side
in the residential construction is very – the market is very, very, very tight right now. There's very, very little
housing supply available.
So you'll see developers – that takes time, again, part of being an island. There's not a lot of zoneable land
available. So it takes time to get the land together, get the permits. But don't think only about the FEMA. Yeah,
that's going to be used. But there'll also be private construction I think coming along. But I don't see much of that
happening until 2022 in terms of the big disbursements.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
When you talk about the big disbursements, can you give us some sort of sense for what sort of magnitude of
some of those projects might be and like how big a component BPOP will be willing to finance?

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
I don't have it on a project-by-project basis, but $10 billion has been assigned to the power authority for
improvements in the power, right. $3 billion has been assigned to the Aqueduct and Sewer Authority for approving
that. So those are big projects.
Highway, I don't have the number on Highway but Highway had another couple of hundred million dollars. So
most of what we have been doing, because lot of that is being financed by federal funds, our biggest participation
to date has not been like project financing but it has been financing the contractors who do the work. So in many
of these projects, they have to put out the work and advance funds before they get reimbursed. So much of what
we anticipate will happen is that our construction clients will have to increase their lines and draw more down to
do these projects.
Obviously on the private side, it's a little bit different. We will finance the construction there. But on the public side,
I don't think that really is the case. I think we'll be financing more the people involved, the contractors, the
architects, the suppliers of materials that type of thing. I think that's what's going to be our sweet spot instead of
traditional project financing.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Understood. And then what about we've heard a lot about the residential market being pretty hot right now.
A lot of the mortgage loans that you guys are doing are conforming and you're selling them. But as the jumbo
market coming back in a more meaningful way, is that something that could help to offset more of that residential
run off as we look out to next couple of years?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah. I mean – I think there is a couple of things there. I mean I think Carlos and Lidio can add to this. But I think
there is a limit on how much we want to do nonconforming. I don't think we have a problem right now feeling up
our appetite for nonconforming. And one of the things we are managing is because of this incredible demand we
are seeing in Puerto Rico, we are seeing a big jumbo market developed where it really wasn't there before. We
are playing very heavily in it as we probably heard Dorado, [indiscernible] (00:43:36), these are housing – we are
making mortgages $3 million, $4 million, $5 million that we never did in our history.
So our biggest issue there is not so much getting that, it's adjusting our risk tolerance for how much that we can
have. It's definitely helping. But we – in this kind of low rate interest environment, we don't want to make too big a
bet on holding mortgages in our balance sheet apart from the risk of the residential market really being hot now. I
mean we've seen things we've never seen in our lifetime in Puerto Rico, houses selling for $30 million, $20
million. We never seen – we never saw that in our lifetime.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Well, a couple of other questions for me. Just when I look at the deposit flows, with $19 billion of public deposits, I
know you guys expect that to eventually come down over time. Do you have any better sense for, I mean – I know
we have about a $7 billion slug that once the GEOs reach resolution could flow out. But other chunks in terms of
the timing of those deposits, is there any way we can kind of pin different chunks here or there as something that
could flow out later this year?

Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Well, I think the biggest chunks, the COVID money comes in and goes out pretty fast. So, I don't have – so I think
the biggest needle mover is going to be the plan of adjustment. The plan of adjustment not only has money to pay
the GEOs, they said about $7 billion but there is other disbursements. I think they are talking about disbursement
up to $10 billion as part of that plan of adjustment.
So that's going to be the biggest mover and it's going to probably change the perspective in a couple of ways.
One, a big chunk of money will go out. Progress has been made on that front. It's taken forever. But it's probably
one of the most complex bankruptcy proceedings in the history of United States. And it's finally making progress.
Recently an agreement was reached with the unsecured creditors committee which is a big deal because they
were very active and very aggressive. They seem to have almost if not already reached a deal with most of the
monoline insurance which also was a big issue.
So as they moved forward, really the one big issue left is how you handle the pensions. And as you know, there's
a provision in there that the amount of any pension that's above $1,500 a month, 8% of it will be reduced. That
has been very controversial with the government. And they claim – so they claim they will not get – they can't
accept that. So that's really the last big piece of the puzzle that's left.
So most people are expecting that we should have a resolution of that by the end of the year or early next year
because the judge is moving the calendar. So I think we're finally looking at a very possible solution at least
involving the central government debt. I'm not PREPA will get done. So we're pretty optimistic about that.
And so that's going to be a big outflow of funds. And then secondly I think once the government of Puerto Rico
knows what it can count on then you can expect that it will start maybe using its funds or investing its funds a little
bit differently. So we'll have to see what happens. But literally right now they don't know what they can count. So
they're just parking the money with us.
But as they enter a more normal environment where they know where they can count on, I think you can expect
for them to make perhaps change how they handle their money somewhat.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it. And then, just sticking on the topic of deposits in terms of the rates you guys are paying, I imagine there's
not a whole lot of room to reduce the rates. But maybe there is some opportunity to increase fees related to
deposits. I mean you can talk about whether or not that is the case and sort of how you're thinking about that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ignacio Alvarez A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Popular, Inc.
Yeah, I know you've got to be careful there because deposit franchise is a long-term asset. And you don't want to
get a reputation as nickel-and-diming your deposit clients just because you're in a loan deposit market. They're
already getting hurt with the low interest we're paying.
So I think, I don't think there – in terms of deposit fees, no. But obviously as the economy picks up and you saw
this quarter, we do expect our other sources of fee income to improve. We saw a nice rise in fees related to debit
and credit cards. I think insurance over time will continue to go up as people recognize the value and the need of
insurance. And we continue to build out our business there.

So we are definitely looking for fees. But it's not – we cannot put in risk of that into our deposit franchise. So we're
– especially with other fintechs and everyone else competing. So I don't think it'll be coming from deposit fees, it
will be more from other services where we get a fee by providing value to our clients. That's really what we strive
for.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
On the cost to deposit, Alex, you're correct it's hard – Puerto Rico is hard to sort of get it to bring it down. Our total
cost of deposit now is 14 basis points, which is close to I think last. But we did – we do still have some room to
bring the deposit down – cost down in Popular Bank. There we have done a pretty good job. We're down to a total
cost of deposit of 47 basis points from probably a few quarters back. So, there still is a little bit more room in the
US, but also keep in mind that it's a smaller portion of our deposit book. So, the overall effect of even getting
some savings there in total will be muted.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Roberts Huxley Twerdahl Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Great. And then just a final question for me which I think I asked last year as well. But just so that everyone on the
call understands the accounting behind the ASR, my understanding is that we've seen the full impact of the $350
million come out of equity already. But we've only seen about 80% of the shares come out of the share count. And
so we should see an adjustment at the end of the third quarter where we could see this share count reduced a bit
further. But there shouldn't be much of an impact to equity. Is that correct?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A

Thanks. Carlos, if you could just review the guide on expenses and kind of walk us up from what looked like

Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
Yeah. I tried to sort of list what the components are going to be. But the main drivers are going to be three things.
First, we do expect our compensation expenses to go up. Part of that is normal course of business. For example,
we do our merit increases in the year in July. So, naturally, the second half of the year will have higher personnel
expenses. The compensation is also affected by the overall performance of the company. So, if we continue to
outperform as we have for the first couple of quarters that would increase compensation expenses as well.
And lastly, the competition for talent is real and we are not excluded from that in Puerto Rico. So, we're seeing
that also affect what we have to offer for new employees, what we have to offer our existing employees, so that
they stay happy and want to stay with the bank; so all those components will continue to contribute to higher
compensation expense.
In the second quarter, we managed to have gotten a little bit of a break on that front because we're also a little bit
behind in our hiring of the people that we need. You may have seen that number of employees went down
slightly. So maybe we've got a little bit of a break in the second quarter that expenses that should have been in
this line did not show up simply because we haven't been able to hire all the people we need and want to hire.
Hopefully, we can correct that. And that, again, will reflect on higher compensation expenses.
Second is timing. There is some projects and expenses that we had sort of scheduled in to be one-fourth of the
expense every quarter. And some of those projects or expenses just simply haven't started or have been delayed.
Some business activities that are related to those projects continue, so we expect those activities to still happen,
but they're just happening later in the year. So we think that will end up in higher expenses.
And lastly a little bit of normal course of business as our clients feel better and do more transactions, our
processing costs will go up. And like every other bank in the world, there's nothing that will keep your technology
costs from going up. Between compliance and cyber and regulatory stuff, technology cost seems to be something
that will continue to go up and, unfortunately, we are no exception to that trend.
So the combination of all those things will increase our raw expense base. As you know, we normally describe our
expense on an average quarterly number. You are correct that we were slightly below the range we have
described in the first two quarters of the year. And that will by – in fact by necessity means that we will be above
that range in the second two quarters of the year. And that's our best guess on expenses right now. We hope to
be set, by the way, we hope for the better, but this is our best guess of what expenses will be.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brock Vandervliet Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And then just separately on credit, given where net charge-offs are the economic backdrop, what would
you need to see to get conviction that perhaps looking ahead we're looking at a much lower net charge-off pattern
than you've seen historically and you'd have the flexibility to further reduce reserves. Just trying to better
understand how you're thinking about the reserving?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Carlos J. Vázquez A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Popular, Inc.
Well, for one thing, reserve is slightly more scientific than it used to be in the past. So there's a lot of it that is
model-driven. So we have certain latitude but maybe not as much as you think in terms of how we can feel
comfortable or not with in lowering reserve.
Having said that, I mean the allowance for credit losses is driven by the performance – past performance, credit
quality, economic outlook, and taking into account environmental factors. If the trends that we have seen
17


Popular, Inc.
(BPOP) Corrected Transcript
Q2 2021 Earnings Call 22-Jul-2021
continues in which losses continue to be low, credit quality will continue to improve. And if the economic outlook
continue to improve, we should reasonably expect the allowance will continue to trend lower as we progress
through the rest of 2021 into 2022.
