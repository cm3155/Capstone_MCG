Thank you, Tawanda. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Bruce Lee, President and CEO. Welcome to HTLF's
2023 first quarter earnings conference call. I appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our solid performance
amidst the challenging environment in detail the strength and stability our customers, communities, employees

and shareholders can depend on. For the next few minutes, I'll discuss HTLF's highlights for the first quarter, then
turn the call over to Bryan McKeag, Chief Financial Officer, for more details on our performance and financials.
Also joining us today is Nathan Jones, Chief Credit Officer, who can answer questions regarding the stable credit
quality across our portfolios.
Last week, our board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share on the company's
common stock, payable on May 26, 2023. The board also approved a dividend of $175 for Series E preferred
stock, which results in a dividend of $43.75 per depositary share payable on July 17, 2023.
For more than 40 years, HTLF has increased or maintained our quarterly common dividend. This reflects our
strength, performance and confidence in our strategies and ongoing results. HTLF has diversified lines of
business and geographies, combined with our local leadership and talent, we are intentionally built to withstand
industry and economic pressures.
Challenging times are an opportunity to serve and reassure our customers. In mid-March, we proactively reached
out to the top 100 customers in each of our markets, more than 1,000 in total, to answer their questions and
reassess their banking needs. This outreach was greatly appreciated and reinforce the importance of our local
leadership in local routes. It underscored the breadth of our customers we serve and the strategic diversity of our
geographic footprint. I want to thank our bank presidents and relationship managers for all their great work with
our customers during a very challenging time. We're deepening relationships, driving new business and well-
positioned for continued growth.
In the first quarter, net income available to common stockholders was $50.8 million, and earnings per share of
$1.19. We strengthened our balance sheet and increased our borrowing capacity by $1.7 billion to a total of $2.8
billion, with less than $2 million outstanding. Our capital ratios, including all unrealized gains and losses as of
March 31, exceeded all well-capitalized regulatory ratio guidelines. Bryan will go into more details.
In spite of the challenges in the first quarter, we added more than 300 new commercial relationships and more
than 8,000 new consumer accounts. Our delinquency ratio remained low at 10 basis points, our efficiency ratio
improved 749 basis points or 12% from a year ago to 57.16%, and total assets remained flat at $20.2 billion.
Let's start with deposits. HTLF Banks have a diverse and granular deposit base as a result of our strategic
diversification. Our customer deposits are diversified by both geography and industry, with no industry
concentration higher than 10% across our portfolios.
Overall, total deposits for the quarter grew slightly to $17.7 billion, an increase of $168 million or 1% from the
linked quarter, and 65% of total balances are insured or collateralized. From the linked quarter, total customer
deposits decreased 4% with a mix shift into interest bearing accounts. While we maintain a favorable deposit mix,
customer demand accounts decreased from 37% to 35%.
In the first quarter, we launched a successful consumer deposit campaign. We opened more than 8,000 new
consumer accounts in the quarter with more than 3,000 in March alone. That's the most new consumer accounts
in any quarter or month in the last five years. Positive trends have continued into April, and customer deposits are
stabilizing for commercial, small business and consumer customers. We expect total customer deposits to grow
$150 million in the second quarter.
Turning to loans. In the first quarter, commercial and ag loans grew $85 million, an increase of 1% from the linked
quarter and $1.2 billion or 14% from a year ago. Commercial loans grew $195 million, an increase of 2% from the

linked quarter and $1.3 billion or 13% from a year ago. As expected, growth was slower in the first quarter as up
to $100 million had been pulled forward into the fourth quarter. Our ag portfolio decreased $110 million or 12%
from the linked quarter as customers paid down credit lines and delayed utilization, primarily due to weather
impacts in California.
In the first quarter, we saw commercial loan growth in 8 of our 11 markets. We added more than 300 new
commercial relationships, representing $210 million in funded loans and $51 million in new deposits. On average,
new originations were of higher credit quality than the overall portfolio, as measured by risk ratings and credit
scores, and 75% of these loans have variable rate structures. Our commercial pipeline remains strong at over $1
billion. We expect total loan growth of $175 million to $200 million in the second quarter, which we expect to
substantially fund through customer deposit growth. Our consumer and residential loan portfolios decreased $18
million or 1% from the linked quarter. We expect consumer loans to be flat to down $10 million in the second
quarter.
Turning to key credit metrics. Our disciplined credit approach is delivering stable credit quality across our
portfolios and continues to serve as well. Delinquency ratio is at 10 basis points. Non-performing loans
represented 51 basis points of total loans. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets remained low at
33 basis points. Non-pass rated loans increased slightly to 4.76% from 4.67% in the linked quarter. Lastly, in the
first quarter, we had net loan recoveries of $1 million.
Despite all the headwinds, we're executing our core strategies and delivering loan growth, stable credit quality, a
lower efficiency ratio, and we're acquiring new customers. Bank charter consolidation continues to go smoothly.
So far, we've successfully consolidated 7 of our 11 banks. The project continues on schedule and on budget and
we expect to finish charter consolidation early in the fourth quarter.
We enhanced the products and services offered by our Retirement Plan Services business through our
partnership with July Business Services. July specializes in technology and brings more than 25 years of
experience to our clients in plan participants. By selling the record keeping and administration services, both firms
will be stronger together as July's technology will enhance the customer experience. HTLF retains investment
management oversight and participant education and support. This transaction is expected to be completed and
record keeping services transitioned in the second quarter. Our strategy and accomplishments continue to be
recognized locally and nationally. Dubuque Bank & Trust was named one of the Best Places to Work by the
Dubuque Telegraph Herald. Michael Wamsganz, President and CEO of Citywide Banks was named a 2023
Colorado Titan 100 for demonstrating exceptional leadership, vision and passion.
And for the seventh consecutive year, HTLF has been recognized by Forbes, as one of America's Best Banks for
2023. The ranking is based on profitability, growth, credit quality and efficiency. HTLF's employees have earned
this recognition each year with their dedication and commitment to delivering strength, insight and growth to our
customers, communities, shareholders, and each other. Their hard work and dedication have consistently grown
and strengthened our company. Together, we are HTLF.
I'll now turn the call over to Bryan McKeag, Chief Financial Officer, for more details on our performance and
financials.

Thanks, Bruce, and good afternoon. As Bruce just described, we had another busy quarter in which HTLF
reported earnings per share of $1.19. Loan growth of just under $70 million, and continued, stable, clean credit

performance. Included in this quarter's results were three notable items. First, $1.1 million of losses on the sale of
write down of assets, which were primarily facilities related. Second, charter consolidation restructure costs of
$1.7 million. And third, security losses of $1.1 million. Together, these items decreased pre-tax income by more
than $3.9 million and earnings per share by $0.07.
Before I go into more detail, I want to remind everyone that our first quarter earnings release and investor
presentations are both available in the IR section of our HTLF website.
I'll start my comments with the provision for credit losses, which totaled $3.1 million or $300,000 less than last
quarter. This quarter, the provision reflects our continued stable, healthy credit performance and consistent with
last quarter incorporates an economic outlook that anticipates a moderate recession developing over the next 12
months. The provision also benefited from $1 million of net loan recoveries. In addition, as Bruce mentioned, our
delinquencies ticked up just slightly, but remain very low at 10 basis points of loans and non-performing loans
were flat compared to last quarter. At quarter end, the allowance for lending related credit losses, which includes
both the allowance for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments, increased $4.1 million to $133.8 million
or 1.16% of total loans compared to 1.13% last quarter.
Moving to the balance sheet, Bruce already covered loans and deposits, so I'll start with investments. Investments
remain flat at $7 billion, representing 35% of assets with a tax equivalent yield of 3.67% and will generate cash
flows exceeding $1.3 billion over the next 12 months with approximately $240 million next quarter. The fair value
mark on the available for sale securities portfolio continued to improve to a negative $568 million, that's a $67
million or 10% improvement over last quarter. The relatively small held to maturity portfolio of $832 million or 12%
of investments has an unrecorded negative fair value mark of $16 million, which is an improvement from $53
million last quarter.
We continued to actively manage the portfolio by taking several actions during the quarter. First, we utilized nearly
$120 million of cash flow this quarter to fund loans and pay down borrowings. And second, we increased security
pledging at the Fed by $1.5 billion, leaving $3.8 billion (sic) [$2.8 billion] or 57% of our available for sale securities
unpledged at quarter end. And lastly, we repositioned our hedges to provide protection for unrealized security
losses against the impact of higher mid- to long-term rates.
Moving to borrowings. Total borrowings declined $284 million to $464 million or 2.3% of total assets. The
reduction was primarily in Fed and FHLB borrowings, which were reduced to just under $2 million outstanding at
quarter end. Our available and unused Fed and FHLB borrowing capacity at quarter end stood at $2.8 billion
that's a $1.7 billion increase over last quarter. The increase is the result of paying down existing borrowings and
pledging additional securities to the Fed.
To summarize, our liquidity profile at quarter end, first, we have $1.3 billion of cash flow coming off our securities
portfolio over the next 12 months with $240 million next quarter. Second, we have a low level of outstanding
borrowings and $2.8 billion of available capacity with the Fed and FHLB. Third, we continue to have several Fed
fund borrowing lines and brokered deposits sources that remain open and available. Fourth, our deposit base, as
Bruce mentioned, is granular and well-diversified, with over 65% of balances either insured or collateralized. Fifth,
our loan to deposit ratio is 65%. And when removing our wholesale deposits, it remains low at 77%. Sixth, we
have cash and unpledged available for sale securities totaling over $4 billion. And lastly, the holding company
cash position of $284 million is 3.5 times our current annualized interest and dividend payments. In addition, our
dividend payout rate is relatively low at 25% of current earnings per share.

With regards to capital, regulatory capital ratios remain strong with common equity tier 1 at just over 11.25% and
total risk based of nearly 15%. Adjusted for unrealized losses on our investments, the ratio remained – the ratios
remain above well-capitalized levels at approximately 7.5% and 11.2% respectively. The tangible common equity
ratio increased 51 basis points to 5.72% at quarter end. The rise in market value of investments this quarter
contributed 25 basis points of the increase.
Moving to the income statement, starting with revenue, net interest income totaled $152.2 million this quarter,
which was $13 million lower than the prior quarter. And the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis fell 25
basis points this quarter to 2.40%. The main drivers of the decreases were two fewer days in the quarter
compared to last quarter resulting in $3.7 million of the decrease, a decline of $1.1 million in fees and purchase
accounting accretion, which also reduced net interest margin by 2 basis points.
A shift in deposit balances from lower costing non-maturity deposits to much higher cost in time deposits,
primarily brokerage CDs, reduced net income by nearly $5 million and decreased NIM by 12 basis points. Higher
deposit betas than loan betas, reflecting the significant increase in deposit competition that began in late 2022
accounts for the remaining decrease in net interest income and net interest margin. And finally, we exited the
quarter with a adjusted NIM of running at 3.35%. Noninterest income of $30 million this quarter was unchanged
from the prior quarter, excluding security losses in core noninterest income, excluding security losses, core
noninterest income was $30.9 million, which exceeded our expectation of $28 million to $29 million.
Shifting to expenses, noninterest expenses totaled $111 million this quarter that's down $6.2 million from last
quarter. Excluding restructuring tax credit costs and asset gains and losses, the run rate of recurring operating
expenses decreased $1.4 million to $107.7 million, coming in slightly lower than our forecast of $108 million to
$109 million.
Looking ahead to the rest of 2023, HTLF expects to see loan growth of $150 million to $200 million or 2% per
quarter and customer deposit growth of $150 million or 1% per quarter. Achieving these loan and deposit growth
expectations should enable the bulk of the investment cash flow to be available to decrease wholesale deposits.
Net interest income for Q2 is expected to increase modestly over the first quarter, and the net interest margin is
expected to stabilize near the March run rate in the [ph] mid-330s (22:17) on a tax equivalent basis.
Provision for credit losses are projected to range from $3 million to $5 million per quarter, obviously declines in
economic conditions or projections could impact future provisions if a worse than moderate recession develops
where credit quality metrics began to decline. Core noninterest income, excluding investment gains or losses, is
expected to be $30 million to $31 million next quarter. Recurring operating expenses are expected to be in the
$108 million to $109 million range next quarter. Charter consolidation, restructuring costs are forecasted to be
$2.5 million to $3 million next quarter. In addition, we expect the total remaining cost to complete the project to
approach $8 million over the next three quarters. And finally, we believe a tax rate of 23%, excluding new tax
credits, is a reasonable run rate.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bruce for question-and-answer sessions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now conduct our question-and-answer session. [Operator

Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hey, good afternoon, guys. Hope everybody's doing well. And thanks for taking my questions. I just want to start
off on the margin and the outlook for the margin. Maybe, Bryan, you could give a little perspective on kind of
where you see your full cycle beta is going to. I think based on the jump this quarter, you're kind of at about 28%
kind of cycle to date beta. Where do you kind of see that shaking out over the remainder of this year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, I think you're looking at probably – you're excluding DDA when you that right, Damon, when everybody
[indiscernible] (24:49)...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
...a little bit. Yes, yes, that's pretty close to what I've got calculated for that same piece. We tend to look at it with
DDA in, but I think you're in the ballpark for cycle. Our normal cycle betas are around 30% to 35% on just the non-
DDA component. So I think they could move up just a little bit, although it feels like they're topping out. It feels like
unless rates start to go back up, the Fed moves and some things happen. It feels like we're in a fairly decent spot
right now that things should sort of hold where they are. But that's how it feels today.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And when you talk about the expected deposit growth in the coming quarters, this is generally going
to be driven from the wholesale side or is this from the retail side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
No. My comments, Damon, were strictly – it excluded any wholesale growth. It was all consumer, small business
or commercial.

New or existing customers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then what – are you able to quantify the impact of the sale of the benefit administration in record
keeping business from a – on a fee income side?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. So what I would say, Damon, is that'll close here in Q2, I would say we'll see a moderate gain not huge for
us. It moves around. There's an earn out. There's some things. So I don't have an exact number to share with
everybody, but it'll be modest. And then what we see going forward is that the fees will go down a little bit, but
also our expenses go down so that should be on a run rate basis, fairly close to an offset. So I mean, we didn't do
this for an economic reason. We did this for the benefit of our customers to provide them a better platform. Both
our sponsors and the participants, better technology, and there's also some additional products that we can sell
on this platform that we didn't have on our current platform.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And then I guess lastly on the loan growth outlook, do you expect a kind of a pickup in the ag
portfolio? I know, Bruce, you commented that lower line utilization and kind of delayed need of funds because of
the weather. Do you expect that to kind of ramp back up here in the second quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. We absolutely do. It was just really timing. We saw significant increase in the fourth quarter. We knew we
would have decrease. We didn't think it would be quite as significant as it was at $110 million because they're
about three weeks behind. We were just out in California two weeks ago in the planting season there because of
some of the flooding about three weeks behind. So, yeah, we expect that to come back.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Damon DelMonte Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Okay. That's all that I have for now. Thanks.

Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Thanks and good afternoon. Bruce, just wanted to get back to your – appreciate the customer deposit growth. So,
is the use of wholesale deposits going to kind of swing with how successful you are on the customer growth? Or
do you intend to kind of stop first all that growth or shrink? How do you approach the wholesale deposit side?

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2023
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. Great question, Jeff. So in a perfect world, we'll grow our deposit to $150 million from customers. Loans will
be $175 million to $200 million; we'll utilize the cash flow off our investment portfolio to fund that stub piece on the
loan side. And then we'd use the rest of that cash flow to pay down wholesale funding.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Got it. Okay. Fair enough. And then just jumping over to the – looking at slide 18, your – whatever – trying to get
the sense of your optimized overhead ratio, whatever you're sort of depicting it just over 2%, is that approaching
the trough? I just want to kind of check in with as we finished the charter consolidation and it's taking a little more
form. Yeah. What is that kind of near term and maybe as we exit the year kind of the target and maybe there's
moving pieces there, but just trying to get a orientation for how far are we on – is there – in other words, is there a
sort of a trough optimization where you get to?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I think – this is Bryan. I think that 2.14% that you see on page 18, I think we'd love to see that get down to
2.10% or below as we kind of get through a charter consolidation. We've done some other things as you noted to
improve efficiency. I think the 2.14%, if I – if you take kind of where when we started the charter consolidation, we
were running at that 2.22% maybe about 2.24%. And $20 million on $20 billion is 10 basis points. So we should
get at least to the 2.14% we're at and better with all the other things, including charter consolidation that we've
been working on.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Makes sense?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Jeffrey Allen Rulis Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.
Yeah. Yeah. I follow you. Yes, I appreciate it. And just sort of a follow-up on the – I just wanted to make sure, so
the guide, Bryan, on the operating expense and fee income, that's inclusive of the RPS sale or we get – you
haven't totally quantified that and as you said there'll be – when there is adjustment, it'll be offset. We're just trying
to see if that's baked into the guide.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah. I think we can – again, the two net off of each other, so if I didn't get all of it out of the non-interest income, I
probably didn't get it all out of the non-interest expense. So the two will kind of have about the same number, if I
missed that in my guidance. I would say, I probably didn't have that all because it won't be for a full quarter and
everything. So, as we go forward and get that true run rate, I can refine that for you.

McEvoy with Stephens. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just start on deposits. Could you maybe talk about
deposit activity across your footprint, particularly in March? And I'm just curious, if you have any comments on
California and maybe if there was outsized consumer deposit openings in that specific state and market.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, Terry. When we think about our entire footprint, all of our 11 markets, we did see in our more urban
markets, higher kind of higher runoff of deposits. The rest of the footprint was much less. And in California, we
actually grew balances during the quarter. And it was primarily because on the consumer side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks for that. And then maybe, Bryan, a question for you. Could you just talk about kind of the AOCI kind of
burned down over the next couple of years, just as we think about building out kind of tangible capital and book
value? I'm just – I'm curious on that topic, what was the cost and process to kind of hedge higher rates and the
value of the securities portfolio that you mentioned in your prepared remarks?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bryan R. McKeag A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, I'll see if I can – I probably don't have all of that here at the top of my head or in my notes. But if rates kind
of hang where they are or what we were protecting with in the hedge was for middle-term rates, which is where
our investment securities are kind of tied to from a duration standpoint. So we were able to put this hedge on to
actually reduce the duration effect on that portfolio by I think [ph] in fact to only (33:59) close to a year. So we
think that protects on our worst side, which is those rates go up, right, and then we have deterioration in our TCE
10

ratio because of that AOCI. So that was the reason for putting the hedge on. I think if rates, and we can just roll
out and the cash flow comes out, it will improve, Terry. I don't have the exact burn down, exactly. But in terms of
how the gain or loss will come out. But I think where we saw the 10%, you won't see quite that unless rates come
down, but you'll see that roll off and that number should get better. Does that makes sense [indiscernible] (34:46)?

Okay. Thanks for that. And then, I think Nathan was on the call. A question for him. I mean, we're all kind of
focused on office CRE and the exposure there. From your perspective, is that where we should be focused as
outsiders looking into the bank and maybe one other parts of that kind of non-owner occupied CRE portfolio? Are
you monitoring a bit more closely?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan R. Jones A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
Yeah, absolutely, Terry. Yeah, I think office is the one that has everybody heightened. We certainly do a lot of
research analysis on ourselves, constantly looking at it. We feel pretty good about it. We really don't have much of
construction there and have a pretty low percentage overall from a concentration. And, of course, it's strongly
underwritten and it so far has performed well. And a lot of the stuff that we're seeing today from a market
perspective was accounted for in a lot of our underwriting as we kind of stress and plan for potential refinance
risk. So we feel like it's in a good position, but expanding that question is kind of where you ask, but what are
other things are we looking at and kind of really paying focus on. We're really trying to get our hands around and
also understand kind of where retail and hospitality or two others that we keep a high focus on. And then also, if
there's any possible [ph] contagion (36:06) into other areas, like a medical office space. So far, we continue to
watch and really keep ahead of just talking with our customers, getting out there, make sure we understand where
they're at and trying to understand where the potential [ph] contagion (36:17) could go.

Q1 2023 Earnings Call 24-Apr-2023
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Just to go back to deposits and just like obviously the trends here in the quarter,
recommend as a – expecting some growth here. Should the mix of growth be – the mix – the trend be similar to
what we saw in the last quarter with demand accounts down and CDs up? And then I guess, what are you guys
expecting on the other interest bearing accounts?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
I think we'll see demand up a little bit because of the new relationships that we – that are in our pipeline on the
commercial side. I think on the consumer side, it will probably skew a little more toward interest bearing accounts.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
[indiscernible] (37:27) There was a fair amount of seasonality in the first quarter in commercial demand accounts,
as we normally have between 1% and 2%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
And so we do expect some of that to build back up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got you. All right. And then – so the consumer campaigns, I suspect that was largely in CDs. How many are these
campaigns still ongoing and is that where you expect most of the – and I guess how long do you expect to run
these campaigns? Or is this going to be a new part of the funding going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
We're going to continue to run the campaigns through the second quarter. And I think we may not be running a
campaign, but we will definitely keep our advertising spend higher than it has been historically because it's been
so successful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got you.

And it's both – Andrew, it is both aimed at transaction accounts as well as CDs, and we have both...

Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
...we're looking at those.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Brian Liesch Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Got you. You've covered all my other questions. I'll step back. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of David
Long with Raymond James. Your line is open.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you about noninterest bearing
deposits, and HTLF has run anywhere from 32% to 40% noninterest bearing to total deposits for the last several
years. And the events of the last several weeks, I think, are causing both businesses and consumers to review
their deposit accounts and there's definitely a trend moving towards interest bearing accounts. And look, we've
been in a zero rate environment for the last 15 years, on and off, or at least most of the time absent a couple of
years. Can the noninterest bearing for HTLF drop as far as 20% or 25% of your concentration of deposits?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bruce K. Lee A
President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Heartland Financial USA, Inc.
David, great question. And I guess the short answer is I don't think so. And let me give you some of the details
about the commercial deposit decline for the quarter because as I mentioned earlier, we normally have 1% to 2%
seasonal declines and we've looked at all the movement in the first quarter and approximately 50% of the
decrease on the commercial side and most of this came out of the DDAs were just business operations, normal
business activity. Another 15%, 16% were tax distributions or [indiscernible] (40:21) distributions. And then if you
lumped people taking money out for alternative investments, going somewhere for higher interest rates or safety
concerns, that would be about 25%, with safety concerns being the smallest piece, there was only 4% of the
deposit movement.
So, when I say that, that's why I don't believe that we can get as low as you're referencing. And our core activity is
to generate new relationships, and we've been able to do it now for, I think, seven quarters in a row on the
commercial side, and all the deposits come with it. So I feel pretty good. It may go down into the really low-30s,
but I don't see it getting into the low-20s.
