Bryan K. Gill
Executive Vice President & Director-Investor Relations, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Thank you, Jennifer and good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's conference call for the PNC Financial
Services Group. Participating on this call are PNC's Chairman, President and CEO, Bill Demchak and Rob Reilly,
Executive Vice President and CFO.
Today's presentation contains forward-looking information. Cautionary statements about this information as well
as reconciliations of non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release materials, as well as our SEC
filings and other investor materials.
These materials are all available on our corporate website pnc.com under Investor Relations. These statements

Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.

William Stanton Demchak
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Thanks, Bryan. Good morning, everybody. I imagine you have seen that earlier this week we completed our
conversion of BBVA USA I got to say I'm really proud of the team and our ability to sign, close and convert $100
billion banking institution within a year.
The dedication of our employees and our sustained investments in technology allowed us to convert roughly
9,000 employees, 2.6 million customers, and nearly 600 branches across 7 states. BBVA USA is now integrated
into PNC and its customers can bank with us from coast-to-coast. We're bringing our technology, talent and the
full suite of best in class products and services to 29 of the nation's 30 largest markets with attractive growth
opportunities as you hear me talk about for years to come.
Now, while we still have some more work to do which is to be expected for a bank conversion of this size, we're
making solid progress with our staffing levels and the branch operations in BBVA USA legacy markets. In
addition, we're encouraged to see the teams [ph] build pipelines (00:02:40) and importantly growing new clients.
Now with BBVA legacy employees now on PNC systems, we believe our momentum is going to continue to
accelerate as we [audio gap] (00:02:51) previously were following the same game plan that we've used in
previous acquisitions. And we know what to do. We just have to execute on it.
With respect to our third quarter results, we had a solid quarter highlighted by strong revenue growth, which
included record fee income in our PNC legacy businesses and continued improvements in credit quality similar to

last quarter, and pretty much as expected, we had a lot of moving parts in our reported results. And of course,
Rob will take you through those in a few minutes.
Loan growth continues to be impacted by supply chain issues and the continued runoff of PPP loans, and also the
strategic repositioning of the BBVA portfolios, which is consistent with our acquisition projections. That said, total
PNC legacy loans, if we back out the PPP runoff, actually grew almost $5 billion, with growth in both commercial
and consumer categories. And while the environment is still challenging, we're actually pretty encouraged by what
we're seeing on the corporate side with spot utilization rates stabilizing, and even rising a little on the back of
strong new originations in our secured lending and corporate banking businesses. And on the consumer side,
we're also seeing promising origination activity, particularly in the residential real estate business.
Importantly, and as you see, our balance sheet remains very strong, and we're well positioned with substantial
capital and liquidity to continue to support our expanded customer base while making strategic investments in our
technology and businesses.
Another exciting development this quarter was the announcement of our integration with Akoya Data Access
Network. This is through an application programming interface. The integration is going to allow millions of our
customers, if they choose to do so, to safely share their financial information with fintechs and data aggregators.
It's an important step in our efforts to help our customers protect their data while also giving them the choice to
share their data with third-party applications. Similar to Low Cash Mode, this integration positions us as a leader
in technology and innovation and enables us to best serve our customers.
And I'd like to close just by thanking our employees throughout the newly combined franchise for all their hard
work which enabled this conversion. Our significant collaboration across all divisions is impressive, and it gives
me great confidence that we'll capitalize on the enormous opportunities ahead of us.
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our results, and then we'll take your questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As Bill just mentioned and notable during the third quarter, we
converted the BBVA USA franchise to the PNC platform in less than 11 months following the announcement of
the deal. PNC's increased scale from this acquisition underscores the opportunity we have with the BBVA USA
franchise. We have a proven track record of acquiring attractive strategic opportunities, identifying and reducing
inherent risks and successfully growing franchises to deliver enhanced shareholder value. And as Bill just
mentioned, we're well on our way to accomplishing this with BBVA USA.
Due to the June 1 closing of the acquisition, our average balance sheet growth for the third quarter reflected the
full quarter impact of the acquisition as loans grew $36 billion, securities increased $12 billion and deposits grew
$53 billion. For comparative purposes to the second quarter, which you'll recall included just one month of BBVA
USA results, our balance sheet on slide 3 is presented on a spot basis.
Total spot loans declined $4.5 billion or 2% linked quarter. Excluding the impact of PPP forgiveness, loans grew,
and I'll cover the drivers in more detail over the next few slides. Investment securities declined approximately
$900 million or 1% as we slowed purchase activity throughout much of the quarter during the relatively
unattractive rate environment.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2021
Our cash balances at the Federal Reserve continued to grow and ended the third quarter at $75 billion. On the
liability side, deposit balances were $449 billion at September 30 and declined $4 billion, reflecting the
repositioning of certain BBVA USA portfolios. We ended the quarter with a tangible book value of $94.82 per
share and an estimated CET1 ratio of 10.2%, both substantially above the pro forma levels we anticipated at the
time of the deal announcement.
During the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders with common dividends of $537 million and share
repurchases of $393 million. Given our strong capital ratios, we continue to be well positioned with significant
capital flexibility going forward.
Slide 4 shows our loans in more detail. Average loans increased $36 billion linked quarter to $291 billion,
reflecting the full quarter impact of the acquisition. Taking a closer look at the linked quarter change in our spot
balances, total loans declined $4.5 billion. The PNC legacy portfolio, excluding PPP loans, grew by $4.7 billion or
2%, with growth in both commercial and consumer loans. PNC legacy commercial loans grew $3.7 billion, driven
by growth within corporate banking and asset-based lending. This growth in balances has been aided by a slight
uptick in spot utilization. And while still near historic lows, utilization did reach its highest level since December
2020. Growth in PNC's legacy consumer loans linked quarter was driven by higher residential real estate
balances.
Within the BBVA USA portfolio, loans declined $4.4 billion, primarily due to intentional runoff relating to the
overlapping exposures in nonstrategic loans. Looking ahead, we have approximately $5 billion of additional BBVA
USA loans that we intend to let roll off over the next few years, which is in line with our acquisition assumptions.
Finally, PPP loans declined $4.8 billion due to forgiveness activity. And as of September 30, $6.8 billion of PPP
loans remain on our balance sheet.
Moving to slide 5. Average deposits of $454 billion increased $53 billion compared to the second quarter, driven
by the acquisition. On the right, you can see total period end deposits were $449 billion at September 30, a
decline of $4 billion or 1% linked quarter. Inside of this, PNC legacy deposits increased $5.4 billion as deposits
continue to grow, reflecting the strong liquidity position of our customers. BBVA USA deposits declined
approximately $9.4 billion during the third quarter, which was anticipated as we rationalized the rate paid on
certain acquired commercial deposit portfolios and exited several noncore deposit-related businesses. Overall,
our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits is now 4 basis points, 1 basis point decline linked quarter.
Slide 6 details the change in our period end securities and Federal Reserve balances. And as most of you know,
we have been disciplined in deploying our excess liquidity with rates at historically low levels. Back at the
beginning of the year as the yield curve steepened, we accelerated our rate of purchasing activity. However,
towards the end of the second quarter, we deliberately slowed our purchases as yields declined. With the
increase in rates at the end of the third quarter, we resumed our increased levels of purchasing, including $5.4
billion of forward-settling securities, which will be reflected in the fourth quarter. Average security balances now
represent approximately 24% of interest-earning assets and we still expect to be in the range of approximately
25% to 30% by year-end.
As you can see on slide 7, our third quarter income statement includes the full quarter impact of the acquisition.
Reported EPS was $3.30, which included pre-tax integration costs of $243 million. Excluding integration costs,
adjusted EPS was $3.75. Third quarter revenue was up 11% compared with the second quarter, reflecting the
acquisition as well as strong organic fee growth. Expenses increased $537 million or 18% linked quarter,
including $235 million of integration expenses and two additional months of BBVA USA operating expenses.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2021
Legacy PNC expenses increased $76 million or 2.7%, virtually all of which was driven by higher fee business
activity.
Pre-tax pre-provision earnings, excluding integration costs were $1.9 billion, an [audio gap] (00:11:38) or 7%. The
provision recapture of $203 million was primarily driven by improved credit quality and changes in portfolio
composition. And our effective tax rate was 17.8%. For the full year, we expect our effective tax rate to be
approximately 17%. As a result, total net income was $1.5 billion in the third quarter.
Now let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to slide 8. These charts illustrate our
diversified business mix. In total, revenue of $5.2 billion increased $530 million linked quarter. Net interest income
of $2.9 billion was up $275 million or 11%, reflecting the full quarter benefit of the earning asset balances
acquired from BBVA USA. Inside of that, interest income on loans increased $277 million or 13%, while
investment securities income declined $9 million [indiscernible] (00:12:39) driven by elevated premium
amortization on the acquired BBVA USA portfolio. Net interest margin of 2.27% was down 2 basis points, driven
primarily by lower security yields. Importantly, in the fourth quarter, we expect premium amortization to decline
meaningfully and the yield on the securities portfolio to increase.
Third quarter fee income of $1.9 billion increased $274 million, or 17%, linked quarter. BBVA USA contributed fee
income of $184 million, an increase of $122 million linked quarter, driven by two additional months of operating
results. Legacy PNC fees grew by $152 million, linked quarter, or 10%, driven by higher corporate service fees
related to record M&A advisory activity as well as growth in residential mortgage revenue.
Other non-interest income of $449 million decreased $19 million linked quarter as higher private equity revenue
was more than offset by the impact of $169 million negative Visa derivative adjustments. This adjustment relates
to the extension of the expected timing of litigation resolution.
Turning to slide 9. Our third quarter expenses were up by $537 million, or 18%, linked quarter. The increase was
primarily driven by the impact of higher BBVA USA's expenses of $327 million and higher integration expenses of
$134 million. PNC legacy expenses increased $76 million, or 2.7%, due to higher incentive compensation
commensurate with a strong performance in our fee businesses, including a record quarter in M&A advisory fees.
Our efficiency ratio adjusted for integration costs was 64%.
Obviously, with the acquisition, our expense base is now higher, but nevertheless, we remain disciplined around
our expense management. And as we've stated previously, we have a goal to reduce PNC stand-alone expenses
by $300 million in 2021 through our continuous improvement program, and we're on track to achieve our full-year
target.
Additionally, we're confident we'll realize the full $900 million in net expense savings off of our forecast of BBVA
USA's 2022 expense base, and expect virtually all of the actions that drive the $900 million of savings to be
completed by the end of 2021. We still expect to incur integration costs of approximately $980 million related to
the acquisition. Since the announcement of the acquisition, we've incurred approximately half of these integration
costs. And as Bill mentioned, we appreciate all the hard work our teammates have done to keep us on track and
to achieve these goals.
Our credit metrics are presented on slide 10 and reflect strong credit performance. Nonperforming loans of $2.5
billion decreased $251 million, or 9%, compared to June 30 and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans.
Total delinquencies of $1.4 billion at September 30 increased $106 million or 8%. However, this increase includes
approximately $75 million of operational delays in early-stage delinquencies, primarily related to BBVA USA

acquired loans. Subsequent to quarter end, all of these operational delinquencies have been or are in the process
of being resolved. Excluding these, total delinquencies would have increased $31 million or 2%.
Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $81 million, a decline of $225 million linked quarter. The second
quarter included $248 million of charge-offs related to BBVA USA loans, mostly the result of required purchase
accounting treatment for the acquisition. Our annualized net charge-off loans in the third quarter was 11 basis
points.
And during the third quarter, our allowance for credit losses declined $374 million, primarily driven by
improvement in credit quality as well as changes in portfolio composition. At quarter end, our reserves were $6
billion, representing 2.07% of loans.
In summary, PNC reported a strong third quarter and, notably earlier this week, converted the BBVA USA
franchise. With this step completed, we expect to add significant value to our shareholders as we continue to
realize the potential of the combined company.
In regard to our view of the overall economy, after somewhat slower growth during the third quarter of 2021 due in
part to the Delta variant and supply chain problems, we expect GDP to accelerate to above 6% annualized in the
fourth quarter. We also expect the Fed funds rate to remain near zero for the remainder of the year.
Looking at the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the recent third quarter results, we expect average loan
balances, excluding PPP, to be up modestly. We expect NII to be up modestly. On a percentage basis, we expect
fee income to be down between 3% and 5%, mostly reflecting the elevated third quarter M&A activity.
We expect other noninterest income to be between $375 million and $425 million, excluding net securities and
Visa activity. On a [audio gap] (00:18:04), we expect total noninterest expense to be down between 3% and 5%,
excluding integration expense, which we approximate to be $450 million during the fourth quarter. And we expect
fourth quarter net charge-offs to be between $100 million and $150 million.
And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.

David Alan George Q

...good morning, Rob, on loans. So you said on the BBVA, there's an additional $5 billion of declines to come.
Can you kind of give us a sense with respect to the timing and how you see that portfolio running off? And then
I've got a follow-up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

likely over the next couple of years.

David Alan George Q
Analyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
In terms of kind of the legacy PNC C&I businesses, obviously, it was encouraging to see a little bit of kind of
organic growth in the third quarter. Can you give us a sense, and this may be difficult, but clearly, supply chain is
weighing on working capital needs. And I'm curious if you can contrast the growth and commitments relative to
the growth in outstandings in commercial? I'm just kind of curious how the commercial business is doing with
respect to adding new names and new commitments. And we're obviously not seeing the benefit of that at least
today in terms of outstandings because of that inventory issue?

Hi. It's Bill. We've been, for the last couple of quarters, our new money commitments have been, I think, maybe at

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2021
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. They're kind of related. I mean, the growth in our secured lending areas sort of stood out, and they
traditionally have higher utilization. So, in some ways, it was an increase in the overall average because we grew
the book with the highest individual average rate. But even in the straight middle-market corporate book, it finally
stabilized. And I guess went up a couple basis points there.

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. Okay. And then on the expense side, just wondered if you could talk a little bit about wage inflation, if
you're starting to see any signs of that in your franchise. And also, if so, is there any risk to how we're thinking
about the merger cost or the $900 million in net cost saves? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
With respect to wage inflation, you might have seen an announcement that we increased our base rate to at least
$18 an hour and beyond that, in some cases, in certain markets, so it's...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

$18 an hour.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
...yeah, sorry. And it's – so that is real. But that was kind of already assumed in our financial assumptions. It
doesn't have anything to do with our assumed cost saves. But there's real pressure there. And the only way
through time to kind of offset that pressure is through increased automation and just frankly, controlling overall
head count.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. So fair to say, the longer-term impact on how you view the long-term efficiency ratio for the bank?

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Rob, was hoping to drill into the expense dynamics a little
more. So your fees excellent this quarter, those will come down, but still appear to remain very strong. As it
relates to the kind of the related cost outlook, how much of your expense guide contemplates sort of ongoing
costs related to that strong fee momentum?
And then, can you maybe sort of size up how the $900 million in BBVA related cost savings fit into the fourth
quarter guidance? In other words, how much starts to come next quarter or it comes next quarter? And then, how
much is into 2022 still?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Sure. So that's a lot there, Scott. But the easy answer to that is that's all in the guidance for the fourth quarter. So,
we – to your point, fee businesses have been – they were good in the third quarter, they've been good all year,
across the board, asset management, consumer services, corporate services, particularly in the third quarter as
well as residential mortgage.
And with the exception of the elevated levels of M&A activity and corporate services, we see all of that continuing
into the fourth quarter and that's part of the guide. So there'll be expenses that are obviously associated with that.
In terms of the $900 million in savings, we are achieving savings. Presently, we got some in the third quarter, we'll
get some more in the fourth quarter. That's part of the guide, but the bulk of the savings will be in 2022.

William Stanton Demchak A

William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
...yeah, at really low rates that then continued through – in fact, rallied through the quarter. So the prepay rates on
their CMOs increased. We had – so you think about it, we mark a book to whatever the yield was, it's at a
premium. All of that prepays because of the low rates. Hopefully, we expect that to abate as rates have now kind
of gone back up. But we marked them as premium securities, and then got caught by the...

William Stanton Demchak A

In its simplest form, what we did, if you think about it is it knocked down goodwill in the way when we marked a
book, because we had a higher-valued asset. So it took – in effect, took in income upfront...

Hey. Good morning.

Good morning, Betsy.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey. I know we've had a lot of expense discussions already, but I'm just looking at what you've done so far in the
quarter, when I look at your detail around the run rate of expenses at BBVA in 2Q, the one month there that you
had and the three months – three full months that you had in 3Q, it already looks like you've brought down
expenses a bit. And I'm just trying to understand what you've done so far and what's left from here, because
you've already executed a bit, it seems to me. Am I missing something there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, no, no. You're right. You're right. Hey, Betsy, this is Rob. You're right. We started, as we said we would. So
we have begun to realize expense savings pretty much across all the categories. But we're just getting started. So
what you see in that [audio gap] (00:28:28), we still have work to go.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then, when I'm thinking about the pace of that expense save, from here, part of it's a function of the
conversion, the lift and shift obviously, but then can you talk us through what comes after the lift and shift in terms
of expense saves trajectory?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A

Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
...really, the question is [ph] it's this... (00:29:07)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Some of it's branch closures, some of it will be in the form of people who have stayed with us through conversion
on stay bonuses. There'll be shut down of systems and vendor contracts and all sorts of different things that will
roll through dependent on time. Some of which we leave around for a bit as sort of back up for not
notwithstanding the fact we've converted, we'll leave some stuff up and running for a little bit of time just for the in
case.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. I think that's right. And probably, at least in terms of the pickup in the fourth quarter activity, we will, as a
mix, we will pick-up more vendor savings. We've already started that. We'll start to pick those up, but at an
accelerated rate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Again, I guess the question really is, lift and shift as a percentage of total cost saves is like round numbers?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
It's the wrong way to think about it. The fact that we get that done at one point in time allows us to then
aggressively move costs. Right? Because legacy system shutdown, legacy vendor shutdown, related people who
are supporting old applications, all of that stuff now starts rolling through the system.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah, yeah. And my point is, it's not the one and done, it's a portion of the total expense save that you'll be
generating.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Look, at the end of the day, the guidance is the guidance, right? We're going to get some more in the fourth
quarter, and then we're going to get it all next year.

Robert Q. Reilly A

I just think – I think the way to think about it, Betsy, is it's sequential. So the conversion and the lift and shift clears
the deck so to speak to get started sooner rather than later on realizing those savings.

Can you guys share with us – you've mentioned a few times within the corporate services numbers that the
advisory business, I think you said in the press release, it was at record levels. But, Rob, in your guidance, you
expect it to come down other than the obvious pipeline that you guys see in your book. Can you share with us
what else your guys on the front lines are seeing about M&A? Is it just that there's just not as much – as many
companies that are left to do M&A going into 2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A

No. Look, in its simplest form, you set a record, you assume you won't keep setting records. There's nothing out
there that suggests necessarily that it's going to weaken from here. By the way, inside of that, we obviously – we
have Harris Williams, but we also had breakout quarters for Solebury and Sixpoint and related advisers.

Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, yeah – no, I know that the – let's say, I'll do a quick math in my head – 25%.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Got it. Okay. And then a question on the loan-to-deposit ratio. You and your peers, of course, have incredible
amounts of liquidity and that ratio has come down. Looks like the Fed now is going to enter into a tapering phase
and clearly, they'll still be adding to the deposits of the banking system until tapering is over.
How are you guys looking at – and I know there's a lot of moving parts with loan growth and maybe some deposit
shrinkage, but when you look out over the end of 2022 and into 2023, BBVA is fully integrated, what do you think
is an optimal loan-to-deposit ratio for you folks? And when do you think you could get there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
There's too many variables.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

William Stanton Demchak A

something.

85%. Yeah, 85% to 90%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
And that was kind of a liquidity safety function. So if you were short liquidity at that point, you'd raise wholesale
liquidity to kind of keep your ratio at that point. Today, we're so flush with reserves into the system. Wholesale
funding is next to zero. And until the Fed – forget about tapering – actually shrinks its balance sheet, that's not
going to change.
Now loan growth, even accelerated and exaggerated loan growth, will absorb some of that. But I think you're
going to see loan-to-deposit ratios low for a long period of time. And therefore, I think you're going to see security
balances as a percentage of a balance sheet – and we've already talked about this – increase across the
industry. And I – that's going to – I think it's going to take years to play out.

No good deed goes unpunished. So since you – from announcement to conversion under 11 months, it's probably

and shift conversion over the weekend, what parts of your technology do you think are further validated, whether

it's your use of the cloud or data lakes or something digital that you're doing that you think others haven't
advanced as far as you have?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, look, with the first question, at the end of the day, we're always in the business of figuring out how to
become more efficient. Think of the $900 million as line items we know we can get. We actually know where
they're coming from and when they're going to show up. So, you're right, at the margin, we'll find some other stuff.
By the way, we'll probably find some stuff we need to invest in, too. So, we just – we put that into our guidance.
We say, look, we'll get the $900 million. We'll talk to you about 2022 when we get closer, but we haven't lost focus
on the primary objective.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, and the $900 million, you know that, Mike, the $900 million was estimated off the expectation that we'd
convert and – when we did. So, we didn't convert sooner than we thought. We did it on time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
But that was a number that – how to say this – a visual [ph] till (00:36:25) we can see it. We know the line items.
It's very precise. The technology, look, it worked. We had, at the margin, some confusion with retail clients on
password resets and some other things. But the basic technology, moving it over, turning it on, it all worked,
which is just phenomenal effort by our team and validates the investment we've made over the years.
I don't know what people have or don't have in terms of their ability to do that. But the biggest element for us,
Mike, and I think we've talked to you about this, was in effect, this data lake idea where since our applications
don't hold their own data, they call from a central lake and they're linked through API and they're cloud-native, it
just makes it very easy to move data and you onboard a new client. It's not much different than as if we just got a
couple million new clients overnight.
That – and I make it sound very easy and all my technologists are ripping their hair off right now – but that's what
we did and it worked. And the investment in that was everything from the data lake to cloud-native to API and
everything and, frankly, to having businesses and technology [audio gap] (00:37:57) so technology at PNC is not
in the back office somewhere doing its job, they're actually side-by-side in agile teams working with their business
partners to develop product and importantly, to execute the conversion, which we did. That cultural element is
probably as important or more important than all the rest.

So, just – in the final look at this, how many apps did you eventually keep from them, or how much in gigabytes

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
[indiscernible] (00:39:07) We went through that before and I can't remember them off the top of my head, but they

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

William Stanton Demchak A

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I don't – we don't know. Yes. I mean, I think once you start using API-based programs, it's almost kind of a click
and drag, right? You don't have to recreate functionality across multiple applications. You can simply bring in
whatever functionality you need from a library of API.

So, let's say you had an application that just needs a checking account balance, rather than you write a full
application that goes and finds a checking account balance off your core ledger, we just have an API. You drag in
and produce it. I think that's a big part of it. It's also credit to the team way back when we did National City. We
moved everything onto single applications, right, a lot of times and BBVA might have done this. You'll do an
acquisition, you just keep too many applications alive because you don't want to choose between one – or
between the two of them.

PPP dynamics are confusing to all of us and I just wanted to ask a little bit about that. So, Rob, on the outlook, I
think it's helpful that you give the core loan growth and it excludes PPP, but maybe you could give us a sense of
what you expect for PPP payoffs in the fourth quarter and then beyond and then also on the NII, is PPP included
in that? And what kind of PPP contribution have you had to NII like this quarter?

Yeah. In simple terms, John, and you're right, it is confusing. But simply put, we expect PPP to be down on
average about $4 billion in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, net interest income contribution from PPP was
about $100 million, and we expect that to go down approximately $25 million to $30 million and that is in our
guidance, our NII guidance.

John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Yeah. Okay. Got you. Great. Another cleanup question here, on the securities, redeployment of cash into
securities, 25% to 30% is the target for this year. Over time, and this gets into the discussion that you had with
Gerard about loan to deposits. But could that go higher over time if loan growth doesn't surface as much as we
think?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I think it could. I think that depends [audio gap] (00:42:21) opportunity set where the yield curve is and how we
think about long-term risk. I mean, part of the issue today, John is you have this long-tail risk, maybe it's not such
a long tail that you end up with a spike in long rates because inflation becomes real, which causes you at the
margin to be slower than you otherwise might be in deploying that cash. I think as that risk normalizes, if we don't
see loan growth, you'll see balances increase.

William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I think they're going to be a lot lower, simply because there's so much cash sloshing around. Remember, even
when the Fed tapers, they're not necessarily shrinking and so with the cash in the system, the competition for
deposits just won't be as great as it once was. So I think at the margin, they've got to be lower.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
And another way of answering that with all the deposits we have, we're not thinking a lot about betas, right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Right. No, that makes sense. Understood. That's helpful. And I guess going back to the momentum you're seeing
in new money commitments, what's your sense from your discussions with your customers of the extent to which
utilization rates are going to remain relatively depressed as long as the supply chain problems that we're seeing
remain unresolved versus the potential for continued improvement, even if the supply chain problems were to
extend well into next year, say? Just trying to get a feel for how big that – how much of an impact that's having?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
It varies across industries. I mean, they – I shouldn't say without question, but the vast majority of our clients talk
about the need and desire to build inventory and do more CapEx, which is why some of the lines have been
increasing. Their ability to execute on that is somewhat dependent on supply chain. And it depends what industry
you're in. If you're dependent on chips for your manufacture, it's a struggle. Other businesses are not and could
build immediately, and maybe we're already seeing the benefit of that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Got it. And if I switch to BBVA and the revenue synergy opportunities. When you think about those, how do you –
how does your confidence level around the timing and magnitude of realizing those differ relative to what you saw
in RBC? I mean, it seems like you guys have the playbook, but just trying to get a sense for differences that you
may see in execution this time around?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Hey, Bill, it's Rob. In terms of contrasting with RBC, just set that aside, in terms of the BBVA, we're very
confident in terms of the numbers, as Bill mentioned, that we've laid out and the plans to get there. It's probably
on the increment better than RBC, just because it's bigger. We know what we do. It's very familiar [audio gap]
(00:45:51). Of course, RBC was successful, but this is – this is more of magnitude.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I mean, Mike would say – Mike Lyons who runs the C&IB business would say it's as much as perhaps a year
faster and he gets there largely because the teams are in place much faster than we had them in place with RBC.
And we'll see how that plays out. But we're hitting the ground faster in terms of teams who are out calling on
clients.

And then we also have a book of business with BBVA that is better than what we had with RBC. So the ability to
upsell that book of business on the fee side, you'll remember I was talking about just their percentage of fees to
total revenue being very low. So we have an opportunity for fee momentum early on. We have teams in place,
and we ought to be able to grow clients a little bit faster than what we saw on RBC just because we're on the
ground already.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, that's the revenue aspect. So the revenue aspect of it is significantly higher than RBC. The expense side, I
thought, was the question. The magnitude that I mentioned is the answer.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Understood. That's really helpful. If I could squeeze in one last quick one. Bill, you've talked about having teams
inside of PNC studying crypto. And love to hear your thoughts on a couple of areas. First, is there a revenue
opportunity for PNC as you've taken a poster look at it? And then second, from a risk perspective, how concerned
are you about the risk of disruption from decentralized finance?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
So what we talked about or what we are contemplating offering, we literally have built today to our clients. And
look, our clients are interested in it as an ability for them to trade crypto in a safe fashion through mobile app at
PNC. I don't have to opine on whether I think that's a good investment or not a bad investment, which we know
with certainty that we have 10% to 15% of our clients who are moving money into and out of crypto exchanges.
So they're interested in it and our surveys confirm that.
The financial disruption of crypto broadly and probably inside of that stablecoin is a real threat. And it depends on
how that plays out through time. There's the risk, I think, that people are aware of with certain of the stablecoins
having, let's call it, suspicious collateral behind them. But there is also the risk through time that a substantial
portion of savings, either domestic savings or even emerging market savings, get absorbed into a stablecoin and
out of the traditional money transmission system. And that would affect the economy and the ability to control the
money supply long term. And I think that's what – well, I know that's what the various regulatory bodies are
looking at to figure out how to get their arms around. But that's independent of whether we let our clients trade
bitcoin.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Right. Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Yeah. But there is a revenue opportunity from that portion of it even by simply just providing the service to them.
And so is that a fair conclusion?

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Can I come back, Rob, on the premium amortization question? I'm just
wondering, if you can help us understand in the 1.54% securities yield, like what either the basis point impact was
or if you even have a total dollars of premium am for the company and what you expect that to look like going
forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, that's all in our guidance in terms of the dollar amounts. But I'd say, if you took a look at it in terms of the
yields, you can see the decline in yields. If it wasn't for the elevated premium amortization expense, we would be
close to down a little bit from those second quarter levels.

Ken Usdin Q

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 15-Oct-2021
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
It's building it. I mean it was underperforming largely because they didn't have the products and services to cover
the corporate opportunity that's in California. And by the way, that opportunity is massive. So the big effort for us,
and we're fairly far along in the process, is to get feet on the ground on the corporate side who can cover clients,
and in some cases, bring relationships with them. So we don't need to buy anything at the margin. We might
rearrange some of the branches there. But the real opportunity set in California is to get corporate bankers and
TM coverage and capital markets players on the ground in California.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Which, in many instances we've [ph] done already in that (00:52:24).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Thanks. And then just as a follow-up question, could you maybe talk about the rollout of Low Cash Mode? Is that
allowing you to play more offense or is that more defense? And then is that with the $125 million to $150 million,
the decline in overdraft fees, is that still the right way to think about the impact of that product on fees? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
So the rollout has been somewhat seamless. And of course, we just – with the conversion of BBVA, we put all of
their customers or enabled that Low Cash Mode on all of the products who converted over. I forget the current
stats, but it's millions and millions and millions of alerts that have gone out. It's millions of people who have been
able to transfer money before they get hit with a charge. It's people being able to choose the order at which [ph]
they (00:53:27) want to pay a bill and return items with no return fee.
And look, in some ways, we kind of led the industry into this discussion, and you've seen how people have
reacted. Part of our lead was in what we charge customers, but a big part of our lead was on technology and
simply empowering customers. And most everyone who has followed is kind of doing it through brute force and
just cutting fees as opposed to offering different solutions, which is the most important thing about Low Cash
Mode, I think. So we're happy with what it's doing. It's knocked our complaint volume into the care center down
by, I don't know what the number is on overdraft, over 50% or something [indiscernible] (00:54:16).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. On overdraft, even higher than that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. So it's done exactly what we thought it would do.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go
ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good morning. It seems like the loan portfolio at BBVA USA will be mostly derisked or run-off by the end of 4Q
[ph] with just a couple billion left (00:54:47) the next few years. Is there an opportunity to kind of fill that bucket
kind of relatively quickly? I guess what I'm getting at is, maybe you can take down bigger holds because you're a
bigger company versus legacy PNC or just some low-hanging fruit to fill some of that loan run-off between this
quarter and next?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
It's embedded in our guidance. I mean you got to appreciate, Matt, we're not – if loans are up or down by $1.25
billion, we're not going to putty over the organic result by doing something we otherwise wouldn't do. It will follow
its ordinary flow. We'll grow clients. We are a larger company, so we can take larger holds if we want to.
Utilization will hopefully go up. And as we always do, we're sensitive to risk. And they have some books of
business that are both, in some cases riskier than we'd like to be in. And in other cases, they just have no cross-
sell opportunity, and so the return on the equity you deploy to hold those loans is just really low.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
But I would add, Matt, I mean, obviously, [ph] central premise is (00:56:06) acquisition, these are growth markets.
So we would expect through time to generate above-average growth, not necessarily in the next 90 days.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

But that's obviously a big opportunity for us.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Matt O'Connor Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Yeah. And I wasn't so much looking for just the fourth quarter. I guess I was just thinking like the next few
quarters, do you get outsized loan growth given [indiscernible] (00:56:31)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
If we get a tailwind at all, you're definitely going to see that. And I think, and most importantly, if you go back and
look at our loan growth through the period of RBC, so kind of two-plus years after we did RBC, we started to really
accelerate in corporate loan growth. And everybody said, how are you doing that? And it's all new customers and
new markets. And we fully expect that we're going to be able to do that in all of these new markets that we just

developed, admittedly, with some noise in the front because we're going to runoff a little bit out of BBVA, and

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi. Thank you for taking the follow-up question. Bill, you guys mentioned about raising the entry-level wage or
minimum wage for your folks. Some of your peers have done the same. Bank of Montreal raised their wages 20%
last week, and Bank of America's got that $25 in 2025 program. So the question is this, can you share with us
what it means for the people right above the entry-level worker, meaning like a branch manager, how far up does
that ripple go in terms of the inflation on wages because of the minimum wage going up?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
It goes straight up through the pay grades. I mean, most of the cost is actually in the compression as opposed to
the initial jump for the people who are at the lowest level. So part of the work set to go through it is to figure out, in
fact, how you move people up who are today at $18. But tomorrow, if the $15 went to $18, the $18 person goes to
$20.50 or so, and I'm making up numbers here, but that's the majority of the cost. And by the way, it's the majority
of the work set to get right.

Hi. Could you put a ribbon around your expectations for loan growth? That seems to be like the big question going
into the quarter. And in the past, you mentioned over half your commercial clients are private companies, which
don't have the same access to capital markets, and therefore, they might come back first. So just one final
thought on loan growth, when do you think we get the big burst of loan growth? Is it a quarter away? Is it three
quarters away? Is it a year away? What do you think and why?

Well, Mike, I think you asked me this nine months ago. And I said I can wish and hope for it, but I'm not sure I can
predict it any better than the next guy. What we're seeing for the first time, right, is not just the new money going
out the door, which we've been growing clients and growing committed money, but we're starting to see that move
in utilization. And if that is foreshadowing what happens into the fourth quarter into next year, then we're going to
have really accelerated loan growth. If we bounce around where we are, then it's going to be somewhat muted.
And by the way, that's kind of what you see in our guidance.
