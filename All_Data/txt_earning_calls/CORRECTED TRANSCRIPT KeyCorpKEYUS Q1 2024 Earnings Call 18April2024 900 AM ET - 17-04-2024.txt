Thank you, Brian. I'm on slide 2. This morning, we reported earnings of $183 million, or $0.20 per share, which
incorporates $0.02 per share impact from an additional FDIC special assessment charge this quarter. I would
characterize our underlying results as solid.
Revenue was essentially flat sequentially despite expected first quarter seasonality, as investment banking
reported its best first quarter result in our company's history. Fees were up 6% against both the prior quarter and
prior year. Retail relationship households were up 2.5% year-over-year and commercial clients were up 6%.
Customer deposits were up 2% year-over-year and essentially flat on a sequential basis. We continued to reduce
our reliance on higher-cost brokered CDs and wholesale borrowings. Expenses remained well controlled at $1.1
billion. Nonperforming assets and credit losses remained low. Additionally, we continued to build our credit
reserves this quarter.
Our capital ratios, including tangible common ratios, were flat to improved across the board despite the impact of
higher interest rates on the fair value of our available-for-sale securities. We ended the quarter with a Common
Equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.3%, up 120 basis points from a year ago, representing our fastest rate of organic capital
build over a 12-month period since the industry began tracking this metric.
I'm also encouraged by the momentum we are seeing in areas where we have a differentiated advantage and
have been investing. While only one quarter, I am encouraged by the strong broad-based results we saw in our
capital markets business across M&A, equity and debt capital markets, and our commercial mortgage group.
We also are seeing broad momentum across our targeted industry verticals, such as healthcare, power,
industrials, and renewables. While I would expect to see some pullback in fees in the second quarter, our
pipelines are up from a year ago and from year-end levels. Market conditions are clearly starting to normalize.
We also continue to raise significant capital on behalf of our clients. In the first quarter, we raised over $22 billion,
holding 12% on our balance sheet and distributing the balance in the capital markets. To this end, last month, we
announced a strategic forward flow origination partnership with Blackstone. This partnership will allow us to
accelerate growth and manage credit concentration risk within our differentiated commercial platform.
It is another example of how we are delivering best-in-class execution for our clients. This deal also further
validates our distinctive underwrite-to-distribute model, in that one of the largest private credit providers has
recognized our platform for its ability to originate, soundly underwrite, and service at volume with our high-quality
clients. As markets evolve, we will continue to evaluate the potential for arrangements with other leading
providers, like this one, which allow us to offer a distinctive experience for our clients, while concurrently
managing our risk.
Turning to wealth management, we recently launched Key Private Client, where we have the opportunity to
penetrate a large, growing, mass affluent segment within our consumer base and with our commercial business
owners. In this mass affluent segment, we enrolled another 6,000 households in this quarter and doubled
production volumes compared to last year. This new business has added over $2 billion of household assets in
just over a year. Overall, our assets under management have now surpassed $57 billion.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
Before I turn it over to Clark, I want to touch briefly on credit quality. As I mentioned earlier, our nonperforming
loans, net credit losses, and delinquencies remain at low historical standards with credit losses below our full-year
2024 and through-the-cycle targets. In the first quarter, we saw an uptick in criticized loans, which was driven by
our belief, which, by the way, we have held for some time now that we will remain in a higher-for-longer
environment as inflation remains sticky.
With that in mind, this quarter, we performed a deep dive on over 90% of our clients that we believe would be
most impacted under a higher-for-longer scenario, encompassing over 80% of our non-investment-grade
commercial exposures. Performing this deep dive confirmed our view that there will be low loss content in these
loans.
Approximately 96% of accruing criticized commercial loans are current, and 93% are current when also including
non-accruing loans. Over 85% of our criticized real estate loans have recourse. I continue to feel very good about
our ability to hit our net charge-off guidance of 30 to 40 basis points this year.
In summary, while it's still early in the year, we are on pace to deliver against the commitments that we detailed at
the beginning of this year. Key is back to playing offense. And I remain excited about our future and our ability to
generate sound profitable growth moving forward.
I also want to take a moment to thank our teammates for their continued commitment to our clients and our
communities. I am very proud to share with you that for the 11th consecutive exam cycle, since the passage of
the regulation in 1977, Key received an outstanding rating from the OCC for meeting or exceeding the terms of
the Community Reinvestment Act. This achievement reflects our collective commitment to our purpose and an
enormous amount of hard work and dedication from every teammate at Key.
With that, I'll turn it over to Clark to provide more details on the results of the quarter. Clark?

Thanks, Chris, and thank you everyone for joining us today. I'm now on slide 4. For the first quarter, we reported
earnings per share of $0.20, including $0.02 impact from the FDIC special assessment. This quarter's $29 million
pre-tax assessment represented a 15% add-on to the charge we had taken in the fourth quarter relating to the
bank failures last spring.
As expected, our taxable-equivalent net interest income declined 4.5% sequentially, within the range of down 3%
to 5% that we provided in January. Noninterest income increased 6% compared to both the prior year and
quarter, primarily driven by strong investment banking performance.
Reported expenses were down; and excluding selected items, expenses were up slightly linked quarter and
essentially flat year-over-year at approximately $1.1 billion. Provision for credit losses of $101 million was roughly
flat to the fourth quarter and included $81 million of net loan charge-offs and $20 million of credit reserve build.
Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 10.3%, while tangible book value declined 1% sequentially reflecting
the impact of higher rates on AOCI this quarter.
Moving to the balance sheet on slide 5. Average loans declined 2.6% sequentially to $111 billion and loans ended
the quarter at about $110 billion, down approximately $2.7 billion from year-end. The decline reflects the expected
follow-on impact of intentional actions we took in 2023 to reduce low-return, lending-only C&I relationships and
the runoff of residential mortgages and student loans as they pay down and mature.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
Lower balances are also a function of lower client demand, driven by the uptick in rates in the quarter and the
return of capital markets activity, which moves some client assets to more attractive off-balance sheet structures.
We also remain disciplined and intentional about what we're putting on our balance sheet. We're very active with
clients and prospects and still expect new loan origination to come back throughout 2024.
On slide 6, average deposits declined about 1.5% sequentially, in line with recent historical seasonal patterns.
And within that decline, we reduced brokered deposits by roughly $1 billion. Client deposits were up 2% year-
over-year. Both total and interest-bearing cost of deposits rose by 14 basis points during the quarter, primarily
reflecting repricing of existing CDs and money market deposits as they come up for maturity and some continued
migration out of noninterest-bearing.
When adjusted for the noninterest-bearing deposits in our hybrid commercial accounts, our percentage of
noninterest-bearing to total deposits dropped from 25% to 24% linked quarter. Our cumulative interest-bearing
deposit beta was just below 52% since the Fed began raising interest rates, up about 3 percentage points from
last quarter.
On the bottom left of the page, we've split out for you our deposit mix by product type and for interest-bearing by
business, including how much of our commercial book is indexed or managed to benchmark rates. We hope you'll
find this information useful as you think through potential beta sensitivities.
Moving to net interest income and margin on slide 7. Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $886 million,
down 4.5% from the prior quarter. Approximately $40 million of benefit from fixed rate asset repricing, mostly from
swaps and short-dated US treasuries, was more than offset by lower loan volumes, higher deposit costs and
deposit mix migration. Day count impact was about $7 million.
Net interest margin declined by 5 basis points to 2.02%, driven by higher deposit costs, lower-than-expected
loans, and changes in funding mix. Both our net interest income and margin continue to reflect headwinds from
prior balance sheet positioning.
Our short-dated swaps in US treasuries reduced net interest income by $309 million and our NIM by about 70
basis points this quarter. That said, we affirm our prior commitments that our NIM bottomed in 3Q 2023 and that
this first quarter of 2024 reflects the low point for net interest income.
Turning to slide 8, noninterest income was $647 million, up 6% quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.
Compared to the prior year, the increase was primarily driven by investment banking fees, which grew 17% to
$170 million, a record first quarter. Strong performance was broad-based across products and industries.
Commercial mortgage servicing fees rose 22% year-over-year, reflecting growth in servicing, special servicing,
and active special servicing balances. At March 31, we serviced about $660 billion of assets on behalf of third-
party clients. Finally, trust and investment services grew by 6% year-over-year, as assets under management
grew 7% to $57 billion. We're seeing strong momentum in Key Private Client as well as tailwinds from higher
market levels.
Conversely, on a year-over-year basis, corporate services income declined by 9%, given elevated LIBOR to
SOFR-related transaction activity in the first quarter a year ago. And the 5% decline in cards and payments fees
reflects slowing spend volumes and lower interchange rates in credit card and merchant.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
On slide 9, total noninterest expense for the quarter was $1.1 billion and included $29 million related to the FDIC
special assessment increase. Excluding selected items in all periods, expenses were flat compared to a year ago
and up 1.5% from fourth quarter. Personnel expenses were flat year-over-year, as a 7% decline in head count
offset impact from inflation and merit, and higher incentive compensation associated with our strong fee revenue
results and the impact of appreciation of our stock price associated with equity awards. Linked quarter, higher
personnel costs also reflect seasonal benefits costs in addition to the factors just listed.
Moving to slide 10, credit quality remains solid. Net charge-offs were $81 million or 29 basis points of average
loans, below our target of 30 to 40 basis points for the full-year 2024. Delinquencies increased just 2 basis points
this quarter and nonperforming loans increased 15%, but remained low at 60 basis points of period-end loans.
As Chris mentioned, criticized loans increased and represented 6% of loans at quarter-end. Roughly two-thirds of
the increase came from our C&I portfolio, with the rest primarily in commercial real estate. Our internal ratings are
driven by primary repayment sources. As loans were moved to criticized, we reaffirmed our collateral coverage,
reappraised properties, further engaged with borrowers to understand operating pressures, if any, and analyzed
secondary payment sources on these loans. Based on that thorough review, we feel good about the loss content
on these loans and, as Chris shared, remain comfortable with our prior loss guidance for 2024 of 30 to 40 basis
points.
On slide 11, given this was a fairly unique quarter in terms of the ins and outs, we provided you with a walk of how
we derived a roughly $20 million build in our credit allowance this quarter. We added roughly $117 million to
account for the quarter's credit migration, partially offset by a $98 million release to account for an improved
macro outlook. Even with this quarter's proactive deep dive, our net upgrades to downgrades ratio across the
entire commercial book improved this quarter, as the velocity of downgrades has slowed.
As a result, our allowance for credit losses continued to build and represented 1.66% of period-end loans at the
end of March. When you analyze our levels of reserves by loan type, you'll find that we compare similarly or better
versus our peers, and we feel particularly well reserved in our commercial real estate, including a 3% ACL against
non-owner-occupied CRE loans.
Turning to slide 12, we continue to build our capital position with CET1 of 24 basis points to 10.3% or 330 basis
points above our required minimum, including our stress capital buffer. Our marked CET1 ratio, which includes
unrealized AFS and pension losses, increased 13 basis points to 7.1%, and our tangible common equity to
tangible assets ratio held steady, down just 2 basis points at 5.04%.
This outcome, despite the roughly 40 basis point increase in five-year rates during the quarter, reflects work we
have done over the past year to reduce our exposure to higher rates. This includes reducing the size of our
securities portfolio, reducing the portfolio duration, and putting on roughly $7 billion of pay fix swaps, while
terminating about $7.5 billion of fixed cash flow swaps last fall.
We've reduced our [ph] DD01 (16:47) by 27% over the past 12 months. Our AOCI was negative $5.3 billion at
quarter-end, including $4.3 billion related to AFS. As we've shared with you in the past, the right side of this slide
shows Key's go-forward expected reduction in our AOCI mark based on two scenarios; the forward curve as of
March 31 which assumes six rate cuts through 2025, and another scenario where rates hold at March 31 levels
through the end of next year.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
In the forward curve scenario, the AOC (sic) [AOCI] mark is expected to decline by approximately 32% by the end
of 2025, which would provide approximately $1.7 billion of capital build through that timeframe. In the flat
scenario, we still accrete $1.3 billion of capital, driven by maturities, cash flows, and time.
Slide 13 provides our outlook for 2024 relative to 2023. In short, our guidance is unchanged from what we shared
in January. If there's one commitment we think will be a little more challenging to hit, it will be ending loan
balances, given the impact of rate increases on client demand and our own selectivity of loans. But as we'll show
you in a minute, we don't believe this will impact our ability to deliver on our net interest income commitments,
both for the full year and the fourth quarter exit rate.
On slide 14, we updated the net interest income opportunity from swaps and short-dated treasuries maturing. As
forward rates have moved higher this quarter, this cumulative opportunity has increased to $975 million from the
roughly $900 million we estimated last quarter. Of course, some of this incremental benefit will be offset by higher
funding cost and a higher-for-longer environment. As of the end of the first quarter, we've realized a little over
30% of this opportunity to date, which is shown on the left side of the slide in the gray bars. This leaves about
$650 million annualized net interest income opportunity left that we expect to capture over the next 12 months.
Moving to slide 15, we wanted to lay out for you the path of how we intend to get from the $886 million of reported
net interest income this quarter to a $1 billion-plus number by the end of the year. In the top block, we've laid out
the drivers of growth, assuming rates generally follow the forward curve and the Fed cuts twice later this year,
once in September and again in December.
In this scenario, we see about $120 million benefit from the swaps in US treasuries, in line with what we showed
you on the previous slide. We also have another roughly $1.1 billion of projected fixed rate cash flows rolling
every quarter, currently yielding in the low 2% range that will get reinvested at higher rates. This offsets the
immediate impact that rate cuts would have on our variable rate loans and other short-term floating rate
investments.
We see some modest benefit in-year from lower funding costs, particularly from our indexed commercial deposits
and wholesale funding. We'd also expect the net interest margin to improve meaningfully to the 2.4% to 2.5%
range in the fourth quarter with about 75% of the improvement driven by the treasuries and swaps and the other
25% through lower funding costs.
In the bottom walk, we hold rates flat to where they are at March 31. In this scenario, we get more earning asset
repricing benefit because variable rate loans and other short-term instruments do not reprice lower. That is
partially offset by deposit betas continuing to creep a little higher. As we've said, we expect to support clients and
prospects to drive high-quality loan growth throughout the year. Should loan demand remain softer than expected,
we would still expect to meet our Q4 net interest income guidance in either scenario I just described.
With that, I will now turn the call back to the operator for instructions for the Q&A portion of our call. Operator?

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies.
Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good morning. Clark, I'm wondering if you can kind of start where you just finished and just looking at
those two scenarios on slide 15. I hear you that it still seems like there's a lot of ways to get to that $1 billion-plus.
Just wondering how you can help us understand the variance of those outcomes, maybe a way to think about
how much those two cuts mean on their own or some of the other kind of moving parts that would change that. Or
is it really just like a pretty narrow answer, whatever the cut scenario is in terms of where that fourth quarter exit
lands?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. Thanks, Ken, and great question. I would point you to 15 and just say, if you look at the two ends, the swap
and UST roll-off, that's a pretty predictable number. We think we've been good about disclosing the details there.
That's, I think, pretty straightforward math. It'll be a little bit better in a no-cut than in a cut scenario, as you know.
But it's within a bound range when you think about two cuts versus zero.
And then on the other side, the impact from loan growth, which, again, we think is coming, but will be a little bit
back-end loaned, has a relatively minimum in-year impact. So, the range of outcomes on loan growth, while we'd
rather have more, in-year I don't think is a huge driver of this number. So, it really is those two pieces in the
middle and the trade between how much more you get from asset repricing, net of loan yields, if there are cuts,
versus what the impact of funding is. And those sort of work to offset each other a little bit, but in a way that we
think is relatively muted for the course of the year.
And then just the other point I'd make is the $886 million, while on the low end for the quarter, was within the
guide. And obviously, when we gave you the guide for Q1, we had in mind hitting not only the full-year guide, but
importantly the fourth quarter exit rate, and we continue to confirm our ability to do that. Is that helpful?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Yeah, it is. Thank you. And as a follow-up on that loan growth point, I'm just wondering in the prepared remarks
Chris talked about the new agreement with Blackstone, and I'm just wondering that dynamic and how that plays
into the combination of loan growth, investment banking fees and kind of like what that means for how you
originate versus how you distribute.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Well, good morning, Ken. So, it's a good question. Let me hit the loan growth kind of head-on. We have always
demonstrated an ability to grow loans. Having said that, sort of three things all have to be present for us to grow
loans. One, there has to be demand. Right now there is not a lot of loan demand out there, so that's point one.
You see it in kind of flat utilization among other things and not a lot of investment.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
The second thing is it has to be in our client's best interest for us to, in fact, provide those loans. And you probably
noticed that we raised $22 billion, but only put 12% on our balance sheet, and that's because we can better serve
our clients, whether it's through the forward flow arrangement with Blackstone that you referenced or a variety of
other markets.
And the third thing is that the loans that are available to put on our balance sheet have to fit our risk profile and
they have to fit our return requirements. Right now, there's not a lot of loans like that from our perspective. Having
said that, what's interesting about bank loans is because there's excess capacity, the best time to make bank
loans is when there's a downturn. And our house view is, we are going to see a downturn and that will be a great
time for us to really use our balance sheet. Your question, though, the implications your question really have are
broader than just the loan growth. And let me just spend a little bit of time talking about how we're positioning Key.
We think that no matter how things play out, all banks like Key are going to have to carry more capital. And as a
consequence of that, what we're focusing on is really serving our clients through capital-light type businesses,
specifically payments, which we've invested in for a long time, investment banking which we referenced, our
wealth business, which we think we have an opportunity to really grow. And lastly, something that we frankly
haven't capitalized on the degree that we could or should have to date, and that's business banking.
We're a really good commercial bank. We've never really capitalized on the opportunity, in my opinion, to gather
the deposits. That's a – business bank is a very deposit-centric business. So, I just wanted to give you some
insight of how we're thinking about the business model going forward and how we continue to reposition Key.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Just on that loan growth topic, I know you have also indicated you do expect new loan origination to pick up as
you look through 2024. I mean, in what areas do you think that you're going to be able to see the better
opportunities begin to emerge? I know demand is modest, as you just said, and line utilization weaker. So, what
areas do you see that anecdotal evidence of a pickup that could drive accelerating originations and balance sheet
growth as you look through 2024?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. So, the first area that I would say would be people doing strategic things. So, sort of a whole transaction
business, which is just starting to get legs under it. We have a significant backlog, for example, in M&A. That
would be an opportunity, John.
Other businesses that are really capital-intensive, where we have leadership positions in, are things like
renewables. I was out calling with our renewables team last week, incredible amount of opportunity. By the way,
this is partially inflationary because there's a ton of stimulus around green energy. That's a huge opportunity.
Affordable housing, still a huge unmet need that is very, very capital-intensive. And then I think you'll start to see
people really start to invest in property, plant, and equipment. If we continue to get an acceleration in inflation,
you're going to see people start to go a little long on inventory. Those are the areas where I think there'll be
opportunities for loan growth. We're not really seeing those right now, but I think they'll develop over the course of
the year, John.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. Thanks for that, Chris. Chris, related to that, is any of the weakness related to bond market
disintermediation right now?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
For sure. When you have record issuance of investment-grade debt and you have spreads that continue to grind
in, there's no question that that plays a role.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Thanks. And then lastly, on the IB and capital markets revenues, I know you indicated that you do expect
some pullback in fees in the second quarter. In what areas? Is that in the IB area, just given the levels that you
saw this quarter? And maybe if you can help quantify the magnitude of that pullback that you could see in the
second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. So, let me kind of start at the top. From a backlog perspective, we are at record backlogs in our M&A
business. Our backlogs are above where they were a quarter ago and they're above where they were at year-end.

Having said that, when the 10-year is gyrating around as it is – if the 10-year was just at 4.6%, I think there'd be a
lot of transactions, but I think anytime there's this kind of volatility, it causes pause on certain transactions.
And so, that was really the premise of my comment as we look at what will come out of the backlog in the second
quarter. And I'm sure because that the first quarter was actually hospitable to getting transactions done, I'm sure
some that would have been in the second quarter actually went into the first quarter.

R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Chris, was hoping you could address in a bit more detail
the decision to build the reserve a bit more. Sounds like from your prepared remarks, you're just sort of trying to
be out in front of anything you might see in a higher-for-longer environment rather than anything you're actually
seeing today. Is that the right way to think about it? Or what are sort of the nuances in there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. Actually, it was completely proactive. I just – I am of a mindset that we're in this higher for longer. And as a
consequence, we have been stressing all of our portfolio. And anytime we do that, we start with anything that's
leveraged because that's most vulnerable. Then we also focused a lot on real estate. And so, as we go through
and we make assumptions that perhaps these rates will stay where they are for some time, that's what's driving it.
And also, we make some assumptions about – my view is we probably will have a recession. And that's part of
the – my macro view is part of the calculus as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
R. Scott Siefers Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then maybe we can jump to expenses for a quick second. So, just curious around
how you're thinking about expenses sort of holistically for the year insofar as we definitely are getting a more
normalizing investment banking environment, which is great, but there could be costs accompanied with that.
Within the expense outlook, what kind of provisions have you made for that IB recovery? And would you still be
kind of comfortable with the guide even if that recovery comes back even more powerfully than is currently
contemplated?

Hey, Clark.

Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
So, look, we feel good on the guide kind of relatively stable, plus or minus 2%. That incorporates, as we talked
about, progression towards normalization. If we get something fuller, I think we can absorb that. Obviously, we
weren't expecting coming into the year the additional FDIC charge, so that's an extra component. We will continue
to look at ways to absorb that intelligently, but we think we can cover the impact of a strong investment banking
year, which again we expect to see even if the second quarter is a little bit lighter. So, we did account, we think,
for that pretty well.

Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi, good morning.

Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Good morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
I wanted to follow up on the Blackstone partnership and just in general with partnerships with private credit. In
terms of underwriting the loans, do you underwrite the loans and is it your sole decision? Does the private credit
partner come in? And how does it impact spreads in term and structure as you do more of these relationships?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. Hey, Manan, it's Clark. Thanks for the question. First of all, I think it's just important to understand the
rationale behind the partnership and that is largely to support more clients, not to manage capital or move loans
off the balance sheet. It's really for us largely in our specialty finance area that's been growing very aggressively.
It's been an outstanding business, but we do think thoughtfully about managing credit concentrations, and this is
the opportunity to do that and not limit the amount of clients we can serve.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
So, I think that strategic rationale is really important. As it relates to underwriting, we basically run the business,
do the underwriting. Blackstone has an option to participate in these credits if they fit their box, but obviously if we
entered and announced a relationship, we've been very deep with them on what the box looks like and what it
reflects, and we think our business reflects market conditions as does their appetite. So, we would expect this to
go well. It's a one-year deal, and we will test the relationship over the course of the year.
We hope it goes very positively, because if it does, we're supporting a lot more clients and prospects in growing
our business. And again, given our, we think, differentiated distribution model, we don't necessarily always need
to grow the balance sheet to grow the business, but this is a case where we would expect to actually do both.
We'd expect to continue to grow this portfolio, but moderate some of that growth with a partner.
We'll get a modest asset management fee to do that, one that we think makes sense to both sides. And again,
we'll test it through the year and if there's more opportunities to do this with Blackstone or others, we'll investigate
those where they allow us to serve more clients and serve them better.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
So, in addition to the fee side, does it also help you with deposits because you can have more relationships with
larger corporates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. I mean last I checked, Blackstone wasn't in the business of taking deposits or providing payment services
and we are. So, we like those kind of deals.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Manan Gosalia Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Fair enough. Okay. And then as a follow-up on the loan review, can you throw some more light on what you
learned in specific industries, which are the industries that are seeing more pressure? And then in your role as a
special servicer as well on the commercial real estate side, can you shed some more light on what you're seeing
there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. So, let me start, if I could, on what we're seeing in our servicing business. Our servicing business, as you
can imagine, we look at what goes in and out of active special servicing. And as you can well imagine, office
continues to be the largest area by far. We have seen some multi-families start to go into our active special
servicing. And those are typically deals that were done at very low cap rates that were highly leveraged and, as a
consequence, are very sensitive to the significant rise in interest rates.
As it relates to our strategic review as I mentioned, we always start with anything that's leveraged, but a few
industries that I would bring out to your attention. One, obviously, is real estate. We spend a lot of time looking at
real estate, very sensitive to interest rates. The other one is healthcare. Healthcare is an area where we have a
very significant strategic hold, and there's no question that there's going to be a lot of consolidation in healthcare
because a lot of healthcare companies are under a myriad of cost pressures. And the other thing – area where we
saw some was just consumer services broadly. Those are the areas.

Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Good morning.

Hey, Ebrahim.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ebrahim H. Poonawala Q
Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.
Just had one follow-up, Chris, when you talked about your outlook for a recession, the stress testing on your loan
book for the higher-for-longer, I guess the markets have generally been wrong, expecting higher rates to push the
economy into a recession. I guess from your perspective, bottoms up, when you assume higher for longer, do you
see a lot of pain within your loan book 6, 12, 18 months out that causes you to have that feel? I'm just trying to
wonder, are higher for longer enough in a world where the economy could continue to surprise to the upside in
terms of growth? Just how do you think about it, especially when you are stress testing these loans?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
So, in terms of just higher for longer, as you look at our book and you look at 2024, higher for longer works just
fine for us. From an NII perspective, that would be the best outcome, just from pure NII. I will tell you, I'd like to
see a perfect scenario for Key would be a couple cuts late in the year because I think that would be good for
business, fees, deposits, transactions, et cetera.
As I think about the economy, my sort of word of caution here is, if you look at the labor market, the labor market
is very strong by any metric. And I just think everyone assuming that there's going to be a soft landing without
damaging the labor market, I hope the markets are right about that, I'm not so sure. So, that's sort of my thinking,
if that's helpful.

That's helpful. And I guess just bigger picture, I mean, I think it's been an interesting last 12 months for Key in
terms of RWA optimization, expense focus, et cetera. Remind us as we look forward strategically, like the one or
two things you're most focused on, is it still in terms of optimizing the balance sheet, expenses, growth, like what
should we be thinking about as we think about just coming out of this and where the next leg of growth comes for
the bank?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. So, coming out of – so there's no question that 2023 was a reset year for Key for all the reasons that you
just pointed out. And I'm really proud of what we did, shrinking RWAs by $14 billion, taking out about $400 million
of expenses. Having said that, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we now, Ebrahim, are playing offense.
And what that involves is us leaning into areas where we already have, I think, a good competitive position,
payments, investment banking, wealth. And I mentioned business banking as well, because I think as we go
forward, the loan-to-deposit ratios are going to be really, really important. We, as you know, have taken our loan-
to-deposit ratio down to 77%. I think kind of mid-70s is where people are going to have to be as you lean into
these businesses that are really kind of fee-centric businesses. So, that's where we're leaning in. That's where
we're investing.

metrics?

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Sure. That's a great question. Obviously, we on a percentage basis are more canted toward advisory. These are
middle market companies. A lot of them aren't going to the equity markets very often, and if they're huge equity
deals, those are always led by bulge-bracket firms. So, ours is heavily canted toward M&A.
The good news there, Mike, is that we've talked before, M&A pulls through a lot of the other things that we do,
financing, hedging, et cetera. So, we feel good about where we're positioned, but the difference probably as you
go – if you went through all the numbers, the difference would be that some of the largest banks, obviously, are
the players in investment grade issuance and the players in large equity issuance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. And the only – Mike, it's Clark – the only other point I'd add there is a lot of the volume in the first quarter
was $10 billion-plus deals, or very large cap than what we do some work with them, we are a middle market
focused bank. So, I think that's some of the delta on things like M&A.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then when you talk about the multiplier effects from mergers, because you said backlogs are up quarter-over-
quarter, backlogs are up year-over-year. I guess you expect some good growth this year after the second quarter.
How could you quantify that multiplier effect? Is that like 1.2x, 1.5x, 2x, does it vary?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
It would be the latter. It varies, Mike. But I did say that our M&A backlog is at record highs, and for us that is the
most important. Because if you think about it, if you have the relationship, the M&A relationship, by definition,
you're talking to, in these middle market businesses, the decision maker. So, I feel good about how we're
positioned.
But keep in mind, these markets, things are not yet normalized. They're getting back to normal, but they're not yet
normalized. And as I mentioned earlier, it isn't the absolute level of interest rates that I think has a dampening
effect. I think the volatility in interest rates forces people to the sideline and to wait things out. And so, we need
some settling in of rates. It doesn't much matter, frankly, where that is. As I said, a 4.6% 10-year would be just
fine to transact, but what we can't have is just extreme volatility.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then last one on that, where is KeyBanc Capital Markets revenues when you look out over, say, a 10-year
horizon? Because I know the whole industry was down by almost half last year and you're kind of bouncing off low
levels. But specifically, for you guys, where are you?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Well, I mean, I think if you look at our normalized investment banking, if you figure $600 million to $650 million in
sort of normalized kind of times, and as you know, because you've followed us for some time, that's been a

double-digit CAGR. And there's no reason why we can't get back to that level of growth, if you think about 10
years and you look at the 10 years prior.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi, Chris. Hi, Clark.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Hey, Gerard, morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Clark, you mentioned about the loan portfolio, how you purposely exited single credit relationships. And, Chris,
you talked about building the business bank deposit base better. Can you guys give us some more color on these
types of credits that you've pushed out? Were they syndicated loans, since it was only a loan relationship?
And then the second, getting back to that business bank. Chris, how does that differ from the commercial bank?
Because I think you said it's two different business lines.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah, so let me take the first one first, Gerard. So, in a lot of cases, well, we have a relationship strategy, and we
had these relationship review sessions where we see what kind of penetration we get and often we let bankers –
many times it starts by sort of lagging into being a participant in a sector that we're really, really good. And we
think we can do a lot of things and have a lot of capabilities.
And it's just a matter of being really disciplined and if we actually provide a loan, and I've often said a properly
graded loan can't return its cost of capital, and so it actually is destroying value unless you can cross out, we're
really proud of what we can do. But if we can't penetrate that client, we need to exit that client to free up the
capital to put it someplace where we can make the kind of returns. And so, that was just the exercise. Obviously,
it had a huge amount of attention and our timeframe of acceptance contracted a bit last year when we were going
through the exercise.
As it relates to business banking, it is the same business as middle market, except that you need to be really
focused on the payments piece because as I said, they're mostly deposit-centric businesses. And that's the

reason that we've restructured in November of last year and put our payments business together with our middle
market business. And we think that's going to be critical to being able to go down market and really serve these
smaller commercial businesses that we think we have a differentiated product offering.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
And, Chris, when you talk about the deepening of the relationship with these customers that may only have a loan
or a deposit relationship, aside from payments, what are those other products that you can use to deepen that
relationship to make it more profitable?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Well, sure. Well, it starts with, and certainly through last year's exercise, the first thing that we went to customers
and said, we need your deposits. So, it starts as simple as getting the deposits, and I think 86% or so of our
businesses, we have multidimensional relationships.
The next thing that we focus on is payments. We've been investing in payments for a long time, and for these
middle market businesses, it's not just moving money around, but it's providing information, embedded banking
and so forth. And then, of course, we have the ability to help them hedge. We have the ability to raise capital for
them and then, obviously, the ultimate is being able to give them strategic advice. We're fortunate that because
we're structured around industries, we can do all of those things. But we can't do those things if the company isn't
receptive to our ideas.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Very good. And then as a follow-up question, I know you guys addressed what you did in the deep dive for
looking at the portfolios. In the criticized loan increase, can you give us the number one, two, or three reasons a
loan moved into criticized? Was it a loan to value, degradation or was it the debt service coverage? What was
kind of the main factors that pushed them into criticized?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
It's debt service coverage.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
So, I mean the first thing we focus on is debt service coverage and for purposes of this, we completely delink any
secondary source of repayment and we assume that the only source of repayment is the primary source and that,
of course, is straight-up cash flow.

Good morning, Peter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson
Chris, you mentioned in your opening remarks that you're ready to play offense again, but sounded a little bit
cautious on period-end loan growth. Can you just talk about the loan commitments, loan pipelines and how you're
thinking about loan utilization in the second half of the year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. So, I don't think those things are incongruent. We clearly are playing offense. We're out hiring people.
We're focusing on the business that I'm mentioning. Having said that, because of our business model, we are not
seeing huge loan demand. And so, if you think about utilization, we're basically flat at 32% and we've been flat at
32% for the last few quarters. Our loan book is building and there's no question that our backlog is not – it's higher
than it was, but it's not at historical standards.

Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson
Got it. Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
And, Peter, I might just say, sorry it's Clark, I might just say, thematically and I think Chris has hit this a couple
times and maybe just to summarize a little bit, I think for us when we say we're playing offense, we think that
looks like disciplined loan growth in our targeted verticals, which we've been, I think, very consistent about over
time. I think it's funded by quality deposit growth from commercial and consumer clients and it's monetized
through a series of, we think, leading fee platforms that build that broader relationship. So, we think that's the
recipe and when we're doing those things and they don't always come together, and they don't always come
necessarily in that order, but when we're doing and running our business in the relationship manner that we intend
to, that's what it feels like.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
Peter J. Winter Q
Analyst, D.A. Davidson
Got it. And then can I ask – if the outlook has a pretty strong momentum in the margin for this year and you've
mentioned a more normalized margin is closer to 3%, would you expect to get near that level, maybe towards the
end of next year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. I'm focused on confirming guidance for this year, Peter, but it's a totally fair question. I do think it's a
function a little bit of the shape of the curve and absolute rates. But as I've said before, I think based on the
business model we have in a normal kind of upward sloping to at least flatter yield curve, I think that's achievable.
So, it is a function, I can't predict where that yield curve is going to be in 2025, but I think, as our positions burn
off, we get more to the type of balance sheet we want to have, and you get a little bit normalized rate
environment, regardless maybe of even absolute levels of rates, but just direction of the curve, I think that's very
achievable.

JPMorgan, please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Janet Lee Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hello. This is Janet Lee on for Steve Alexopoulos. Just following up on John's question earlier on investment
banking and capital markets, are you maintaining your stance that you're progressing towards this normal level of
$600 million to $650 million range for IBs this year? Because if I look at, absent a double-digits decline in IB fees
in the second quarter, it looks like you're on pace to exceed that normal level. Is that fair way to describe, and
where is that decline in IB fees expected in the second quarter mostly coming from, is it debt capital markets,
commercial mortgage? Can you provide more insight?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yes, this is Clark, Janet. So, we would be consistent with where we were before, which is kind of that $600 million
to $650 million range. We think that feels right. We do think there's upside to that. But as Chris mentioned, we'll
be down in the second quarter. I think that's a function of not necessarily any one area because the rate volatility,
I think, is causing some hesitancy in a few different places. That doesn't change our outlook for the year, but I
don't think at this point we're totally prepared to say that we'll go to kind of a whole normalized view.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
Janet Lee Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And just one follow-up on your loan review. I understand that office CRE is a very small portion of your
overall portfolio. And as you've done the reappraisals on the properties on – I guess, including office, if you have,
like, what percentage of decline you're generally seeing on your office and what's happening to the updated cash
flows from the landlords? Any insight you could share on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah, I think we'll have to come back a little bit on office just to make sure we have those numbers right. It's not a
huge portfolio. And while we're watching it, I just don't have those details in front of me.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Janet Lee Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.

Operator: We do have a question from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thank you. I have a quick follow-up for you guys. Clark, can you share – well, you talked about the Blackstone
relationship and I think you mentioned that they'll participate in the specialty finance originations. How does this
relationship differ from the other relationships you guys have had? Chris, obviously, you have always pointed out
the originate-to-distribute model was one of your key metrics here. And I was just curious how this one with
Blackstone is going to differ from what you've already had in place for years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. So, this is just a lot more formalized in that we actually work together and we actually service it and we're
together focused on this certain asset class. But to your point, we've been distributing the preponderance of
everything we originate forever, including to a lot of the credit funds. So, it's a formalization and, most importantly,
it's a forward flow agreement. So, whereas we've always participated on a deal-by-deal basis, this is an
arrangement as we go forward.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
And, Gerard, just on the concentration point, because it is a concentration management tool, this allows us to do it
kind of at origination and not in this book historically. We didn't do a lot of syndications. We would do
securitizations on a client-by-client basis, but that takes time, as you know. So, this allows us to do it kind of on
the fly as we're going and manage that concentration.

Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
I got it. And then just a quick follow-up on it. Have you guys worked with Blackstone in the past before this
agreement or is this your first initial foray with them?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
No, we've worked on a transactional basis with Blackstone in the past for certain.

Gerard Cassidy Q

Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Hey, thank you, Gerard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: Thank you. And we have a question from John Pancari from Evercore. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hi. Sorry for the follow-up. Just one quick follow-up here. Chris, I believe you just mentioned in discussing your
criticized assets that you delink secondary source of repayment when you're considering the credit's ability to
repay in your criticized status. Does that mean you exclude and don't consider any recourse agreement that you
have with either financial sponsors or the underlying borrower?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
That's correct. So, we're looking at straight-up cash on cash, what's the cash flow, what's the ability to service the
debt based on the cash flow. [ph] So, we're seeing of course (56:37)...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. And you exclude that recourse?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
That's right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Sorry. Go ahead.

Q1 2024 Earnings Call 18-Apr-2024
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. So, it's a conservative perspective for sure. I'll give you an example. We have – because I just looked
through all of these, we have a company that has a market cap of, say, $24 billion, but they're having some near-
term operational challenges. They, for example, would be on the list of criticized assets, just to give you an idea.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Clark H. I. Khayat A
Chief Financial Officer, KeyCorp
Yeah. And just to be clear, John, as Chris said, it's the primary repayment for the risk rating, which is what gets
declassified. We then take into account the secondary pieces when we think about ultimate loss content.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Right. Okay. Got it. Thanks, Clark. All right. Appreciate it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: And we have a question from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. Just a big picture question. You stressed weak loan growth, and I'm just wondering, is that a sign the
economy's not as strong as people think it is? I mean, you're in a lot of different states in the US. Or is it simply
your commercial clients saying, hey, we want to borrow, we're just going to wait for rates to drop?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
I think it's both, Mike. I think I have not seen a lot of people making significant investments in property, plant, and
equipment, and I'm not seeing people make significant investments in inventory, in technology, and in people. So,
I think it's a combination of both. I think rates clearly have an impact, but I think uncertainty as to the path and
direction of the economy is also a factor.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. So, this is more a concern among the decision makers about what's their ultimate cost of capital due to the
volatility in rates than it is some underlying, hey, we're going into a recession right now.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher M. Gorman A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, KeyCorp
No, I think it's both. I'm not saying that they think that we're going to go into a recession, but I think there's just a
lot of uncertainty about the path of the economy. Will the Fed engineer a soft landing, kind of very similar to the
conversation we've been having this morning.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. All right. Thank you.
