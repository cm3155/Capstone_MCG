Ronald Philip O'Hanley
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier this morning, we released our Q3 results, which reflect
continued strong performance across our enterprise. Before I discuss our third quarter financial results, I want to
acknowledge our employees for their ongoing achievements in supporting our clients in generating the
performance and momentum we are now seeing across the franchise. Thanks to their hard work and execution,
we are now seeing measurable progress in our financial results, even as we invest in our business for the future.
We continue to successfully execute against our strategic objective of being an enterprise outsource solutions
provider across the front, middle and back office, and a leading asset manager. This is just the beginning.
We are encouraged by the opportunities we see within our industry, our sales wins, the momentum in our pipeline
and what this means for our ability to drive future growth in 2022 and achieve our recently enhanced medium-
term financial targets.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2021
We are encouraged by the trajectory of our organic profile, as demonstrated by our year-to-date business wins.
For example, on a year-to-date basis, we have delivered the strongest AUC/A wins in the company's history,
while AUC/A won, but not yet installed, stood at $2.7 trillion at quarter end.
At Global Advisors, our ETF franchise crossed $1 trillion of AUM this year, with year-to-date SPDR flows on track
for a record year, and already surpassing the full year 2020 flows. Global Advisors financial performance
continues to strengthen, with pre-tax margin expanding to 36% in Q3.
I also want to take a moment to note the intended acquisition of Brown Brothers Harriman Investor Services,
which we announced in the third quarter. We are excited by the opportunities this transaction presents. It is a
strong demonstration of our confidence in the industry, our Investment Servicing business and our overall
strategy. The transaction is also financially compelling, as it will enhance State Street's financial profile, and
importantly, it will create long-term value for our shareholders.
From a strategic perspective, this combination will strengthen our competitive positioning and market leadership
and deepen geographic coverage, with State Street becoming the number one provider of asset servicing globally
by assets under custody.
Further, the accompanying talent will build on State Street's already strong expertise and better position us for
growth. The compelling nature of the deal has enabled us to raise our medium-term pre-tax margin target.
Turning to slide 3, I will review our third quarter highlights. Third quarter EPS was $1.96, up 35% year-over-year.
We delivered about 7 percentage points of positive operating leverage this quarter and generated a strong
improvement in State Street's third quarter pre-tax margin, which increased by about 5 percentage points year-
over-year to over 29%.
This year-over-year improvement was driven by solid fee revenue growth, good organic results and higher NII
supported by robust loan growth, leading to a strong total revenue performance. Meanwhile, our focus on
expense discipline continued to drive earnings growth as expenses remain well contained.
Relative to the year-ago period, quarterly total fee revenue increased 9% as we delivered broad-based
improvement across all fee revenue lines. Servicing and management fees increased 7% and 10% year-over-
year, respectively, and we delivered solid results within our markets businesses despite a continued moderation
of FX market volatility.
Even with 9% year-over-year total fee revenue growth, expenses were well controlled, increasing just 1% over the
same period. Total expenses were flat year-over-year, excluding notable items as our productivity improvements
continued to yield results.
AUC/A increased to a record $43.3 trillion at quarter end, with new asset servicing wins increasing to $1.7 trillion
for the quarter, including a large Alpha mandate with Legal & General, which was announced in July. As a result,
AUC/A won, but not yet installed, increased to $2.7 trillion at quarter end, as I noted a moment ago.
Including the Legal & General mandate, we reported three new Alpha client wins in the third quarter, taking the
total number of Alpha clients to 18 at quarter end.
At Charles River, annual recurring revenue increased 12% year-over-year to $239 million, and I am pleased with
its business performance and how it continues to propel our Alpha strategy.

At Global Advisors, assets under management totaled $3.9 trillion at quarter end, and management fees
increased to a record $526 million in the third quarter, benefiting from higher average equity market levels and
continued inflows to our ETF franchise, where we continue to innovate.
For example, in recent years, we have been expanding our actively managed ETF capabilities. And through three
quarters this year, we have the most successful active ETF in the US in terms of asset growth, with the SPDR
Blackstone Senior Loan ETF.
By quarter end, this fund had gathered $5.5 billion inflows in 2021 and had AUM of $7.7 billion. We also made an
addition to our actively managed fixed income ETF range in the third quarter with the launch of the SPDR Loomis
Sayles Opportunistic Bond ETF.
Turning to our balance sheet and capital, we completed a $1.9 billion common stock offering related to the
proposed acquisition of BBH Investor Services in the third quarter. Also related to the transaction, we suspended
common share repurchases in the third quarter and currently expect to reinstate common share repurchases
during the second quarter of next year.
We increased our quarterly common stock dividend by 10% in the third quarter. Capital return remains a key part
of our medium-term targets, and we recognize its importance to our shareholders. We believe that the BBH
Investor Services acquisition is a financially compelling use of our capital and that it will deliver earnings accretion
and value creation for our shareholders over time.
And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail.

Eric W. Aboaf
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, State Street Corp.
Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my review of our third quarter results on slide 4. We
reported GAAP EPS of $1.96, or $2, excluding the impact of notable items. On the left panel of the slide, you can
see that we delivered strong revenue growth year-over-year across every line item, controlled expenses, we
delivered significant pre-tax margin expansion, all of which drove strong earnings growth.
In fact, expenses were down year-on-year, excluding notable items and the headwinds from currency translation,
which you can see at the bottom of the slide. This was another strong quarter, where we were able to
demonstrate the progress we're making in delivering on both our strategic priorities and our medium-term targets.
Turning to slide 5, you'll see our business volume growth. Period-end AUC/A increased 18% year-on-year to a
record $43.3 trillion. The year-on-year increase was largely driven by higher market levels, net new business
growth and client flows. At Global Advisors, AUM increased 23% year-on-year to $3.9 trillion. The year-on-year
increase was primarily driven by higher market levels, coupled with net inflows. Quarter-on-quarter, both AUC/A
and AUM were relatively flat given relatively stable domestic market levels.
Turning to slide 6, you can see another quarter of strong business momentum. Third quarter servicing fees
increased 7% year-on-year. The increase reflects higher average equity market levels, good client activity and
flows and positive net new business. These items were only partially offset by normal pricing headwinds and
about 1 percentage point of impact from some divestiture activity. On a sequential basis, servicing fees were flat
as favorable equity markets and client activity were offset by about 1 percentage point of currency translation from
the US dollar appreciation.

AUC/A wins totaled roughly $1.7 trillion in the third quarter, which gets us to a record of over $3 trillion of new
AUC/A wins year-to-date. We continue to estimate that we need at least $1.5 trillion in gross AUC/A wins annually
in order to offset typical client attrition, normal pricing headwinds. And given the strong wins we've garnered year-
to-date, we have already more than doubled that this year.
At quarter end, AUC/A won, but not yet installed, amounted to $2.7 trillion. And I would also note that the unique
Alpha value proposition represents a large proportion, which reflects our competitive strength as the only front-to-
back office offering from a single provider.
I will remind you that installations typically incur in phases and over time, and deals will vary by fee and product
mix. And as we've discussed previously, we would expect current won, but yet to be installed AUC/A to be
converted over the coming 12 to 24-month time period, with about half of the annualized revenue benefit through
2022 and about half in 2023.
We continue to be pleased with our pipeline and our robust wins this quarter further showcases the broad-based
geographic and multi-segment momentum of our business and will help drive net new business revenue growth in
2022.
Turning to slide 7, third quarter management fees reached a record $526 million, up 10% year-on-year and were
up 4% quarter-on-quarter, resulting in a record investment management pre-tax margin of about 36%. Both the
year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter management fee results primarily benefited from higher average equity
market levels and strong ETF flows. These year-on-year benefits were only partially offset by the impact of the
previously reported idiosyncratic institutional asset – client asset reallocation and money market fee waivers.
Notably, we previously estimated that gross money market fee waivers on our management fees could be
approximately $20 million to $25 million per quarter. As a result of the recent improvement in short end rates, we
now expect they will be modestly lower at around $20 million in the fourth quarter, assuming current forward
rates.
Lastly, as you will recall, we have taken a number of actions to deliver growth in our long-term institutional and
ETF franchises, and we continue to have strong momentum and year-to-date results, as you can see on the
bottom right of the slide.
Turning to slide 8, let me discuss the other important revenue – fee revenue lines in more detail. Within FX trading
services, we are pleased that we continued to generate strong client volumes, which remained above pre-
pandemic levels in the third quarter. Relative to the third quarter of 2020, FX revenue increased 3% year-on-year,
reflecting higher direct sales and trading revenue and indirect volumes, partially offset by lower FX volatility. FX
revenue was down 2% quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by seasonally lower client volumes and spreads.
Moving to securities finance, third quarter fees increased 26% year-on-year, mainly reflecting higher client
securities loan balances and spreads, as well as business wins in Enhanced Custody. On a sequential basis, fees
were down 3% quarter-on-quarter, mainly as a result of lower agency balances. Finally, third quarter software and
processing fees increased 15% year-on-year, but were 8% lower quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by CRD,
which I'll turn to next.
Moving to slide 9, I'd like to highlight our CRD and Alpha performance. We delivered strong standalone CRD
results in the quarter, with a year-on-year revenue growth of 22%. We saw growth across all three categories of
6


State Street Corp.
(STT) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2021 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2021
CRD revenues: on-premise, professional services, and software-enabled. The more durable SaaS and
professional services revenues continued to grow nicely and were up 18% year-on-year. Record new quarterly
bookings of $28 million and a healthy revenue backlog of $105 million also demonstrate the continued business
momentum that we're seeing in CRD, supported by the Alpha value proposition.
On the bottom right of the slide, we show some of the third quarter highlights from our State Street Alpha
mandates. We reported three new Alpha mandates during the third quarter as the value proposition continues to
resonate well with clients. Notably, since inception through third quarter, we now have 7 of 18 total Alpha client
mandates that are live.
As a testament to our ongoing commitment and investment to further building out our Alpha value proposition,
we've also acquired Mercatus, a premier front and middle office solutions and data management provider for
private market managers. In connection with the acquisition, we launched Alpha for Private Markets, which will
extend our end-to-end data platform offering for alternatives.
Turning to slide 10, third quarter NII increased 2% year-on-year, mainly driven by higher loan balances, growth in
the investment portfolio, and more deposits, as well as the absence of the previously disclosed third quarter 2020
true-up, partially offset by lower investment portfolio yields due to the low rate environment. Relative to the
second quarter, NII came in 4% higher, primarily as a result of higher loan balances and a larger investment
portfolio, as well as higher short-term rates, all of which was partially offset by ongoing compression of yields.
I would also note that we saw larger than usual slowdown in premium amortization in the quarter due to some
tactical rotation on the MBS portfolio, which accounted for about a third of the sequential quarter improvement
and something we wouldn't expect to repeat in the fourth quarter.
On the right of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the third quarter. Notably, total average
deposits decreased by $9 billion in the third quarter, or a decrease of roughly 4% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting the
active management of non-operational deposits. We also put more of our surplus balance sheet cash to work. We
added approximately $3 billion quarter-on-quarter to our investment portfolio. We also increased our average loan
balances quarter-on-quarter to $32 billion in response to the good client demand.
Turning to slide 11, third quarter expenses, excluding notable items, were flat year-over-year, as productivity
savings for the quarter continue to more than offset targeted business investments, typical expense headwinds,
and $10 million to $20 million of higher-than-expected revenue-related quarterly costs. Compared to the third
quarter of last year, on a line item basis, excluding notables, compensation and employee benefits was down 1%,
driven by higher salary deferrals and lower head count, partially offset by higher medical benefit costs as claims
begin to normalize.
Information systems and communications were up 3% due to continued investment in infrastructure and our
technology estate, partially offset by our savings programs. Transaction processing was up 8%, primarily driven
by higher revenue-related expenses associated with sub-custody volumes and market data costs. Occupancy
was down 6%, reflecting benefits from our footprint optimization efforts. And other expenses were down 5%,
primarily driven by lower asset management sub-advisory fees and the timing of some marketing costs. Relative
to the second quarter, expenses, excluding notable items, were down, primarily driven by the currency translation
of the strong dollar and lower head count.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2021
Overall, we are pleased with our continued ability to demonstrate productivity and expense discipline, while
driving high-single-digit fee revenue growth year-over-year. When combined together, we delivered a solid pre-tax
margin of nearly 30% and generated a robust operating leverage of about 7 percentage points year-over-year.
Moving to slide 12, on the right of the slide, we show our capital highlights. As Ron mentioned earlier, to finance
the proposed acquisition of Brown Brothers' Investment Services (sic) [Investor Services] (00:18:41) business, we
completed a $1.9 billion common offering this quarter. Also in conjunction with the transaction, we did not
repurchase any stock during the third quarter and intend to temporarily suspend repurchases before resuming
them during the second quarter of 2022. Lastly, we still increased our quarterly dividend by 10% and returned a
total of $179 million to shareholders in the third quarter in the form of dividends paid.
So left of this slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As you can see, we continue to
navigate the operating environment with strong capital levels, with or without the recent equity raise, relative to
our requirements. As of the third quarter, our standardized CET1 ratio improved by roughly 230 basis points
quarter-on-quarter to 13.5%. The improvement was primarily driven by the issuance of $1.9 billion of common
stock related to the proposed acquisition of Brown Brothers' Investment Services (sic) [Investor Services]
(00:19:37) and higher retained earnings. We also managed down our RWAs.
Our Tier 1 leverage ratio also improved quarter-on-quarter by a little over 100 basis points to 6.3%, primarily
driven by the issuance of the common stock, a decrease in the balance sheet size as we actively reduced some
excess deposits, and higher retained earnings. Post-closing of the Brown Brothers' Investment Services (sic)
[Investor Services] (00:19:58) acquisition, we expect both capital ratios to be at the lower end of our target
ranges.
Turning to slide 13, in summary, I'm pleased with our quarterly performance, which demonstrates continued
business momentum on our top line and productivity and engineering across our operating model. Total fee
revenue was up 9% year-over-year, continuing the momentum we saw last quarter, reflecting growth in all
businesses, with management fees reaching a record level this quarter. Our expenses remained effectively flat,
excluding the impact of notable items, as a result of our productivity efforts, notwithstanding higher revenue-
related costs mentioned earlier. As a result, we delivered about 7 percentage points of operating leverage year-
on-year, and we're able to drive pre-tax margin and ROE closer to our recently enhanced medium-term targets
even in this low rate environment.
Next, I'd like to update our outlook. With just one quarter left in the year, I would like to provide our current
thinking regarding the full-year outlook. At a macro level, our rate outlook broadly aligns to the current forward
rate curve. We're also assuming global equity market levels will be flat to the third quarter average for the rest of
the year, as well as continued normalization of FX market volatility.
In terms of the full-year outlook, we expect overall fee revenue to be up 5% year-over-year, with servicing fees
expected to be up 7.5% to 8.5% year-over-year. You will recall that at the beginning of the year, our guide was for
total fee revenue to be flat to up 2%. So this continues to be a meaningful increase over our earlier expectations.
We increased this due to both higher equity markets and our net new business performance.
Regarding NII, we had a small rebound in the short-end market rates and some movement in the longer end of
the curve as well. We now expect NII in the range of $475 million to $490 million next quarter, which is a
meaningful improvement from the range we provided last quarter. This assumes rates do not deteriorate and
premium amortization continues to trend favorably, though as I mentioned earlier, we would not expect the same
episodic slowdown in amortization that we saw in the third quarter to repeat in 4Q.

Turning to expenses, we remain confident in our ability to effectively manage core operating costs while
onboarding new clients and investing in the business. Given the strong revenue performance this year and the
healthy pipeline in front of us, we now see the need to both invest in our staff and in our business, as well as
covering some revenue-related costs. We thus expect full-year expenses, ex-notables, be up 1% to 1.25% year-
over-year, which means a sequentially quarter increase into the fourth quarter. This is the equivalent of full-year
expenses being flat adjusted for the currency translation headwind, and this would put us in a position to drive
solid full year margin expansion and operating leverage in spite of the double-digit year-on-year decline in NII. On
taxes, we now expect that full year 2021 tax rate will be towards the lower end of our range of 17% to 19%.
And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Thanks, Eric. To conclude our prepared remarks, we had a strong third quarter and continue to demonstrate
measurable progress towards achieving our medium-term financial targets, including our recently increased pre-
tax margin target.
As we look ahead, we need to both appropriately recognize staff for a strong year and proactively invest in our
business as we see growth accelerate. These strategic investments will include the Alpha platform and private
markets expansion, in particular as well as State Street Digital to drive future growth.
As we stand here today and make these business investments for the next stage of growth, we have confidence
that we will be able to do so, while also delivering positive operating leverage and expanding our pre-tax margin
each year through our medium-term horizon, aided by the strong momentum we are seeing across our
businesses.
With that, operator, we can now open the call for questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, maybe we can start with a question around asset
management. I'm not sure if you can answer, but I'll give it a shot. So, we obviously continue to see market
speculation surrounding strategic alternatives to SSGA. We've seen that in the past as well. Ron, you've been
very vocal about sort of the secular changes in the asset management industry that are sort of supporting your
growth strategy on the servicing fee side, and a lot of that just emphasize the scale.
So, I guess, with that in mind, do you think SSGA has enough scale to succeed in the marketplace today? And if
there are sort of strategic alternatives that you're considering, do you need to remain a majority shareholder of
any asset management kind of entity or if minority or a GB structure would make more sense, are the capital rules
just too onerous and the obstacles too high to ultimately get anything done here?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Well, Alex, thanks, and you've said a mouthful there. The – I mean, I'll begin this by saying that we like the
business, and we particularly like our business. It is continued – its performance has continued to improve and it's
now at least at average, if not above average in terms of the market and continues to grow in what are secularly
growing areas, if you think about the ETF business, particularly fixed income ETFs, et cetera.
So, we think the business is – it's an attractive business. It's a business that helps us strategically from a portfolio
perspective. And for many years now, it's been a bit of a laboratory for us to test out different things that gives us
an insight into the rest of the marketplace. So, our overriding goal would be to continue to participate in the
business, it's something that we continue to believe that we can improve performance. I'm not going to comment
on speculation other than say that it's speculation. And if we have something to talk about, we'll certainly come to
you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. Fair enough. Eric, maybe one follow-up for you, just on the servicing fee side, obviously, a really nice
momentum in terms of wins. But servicing fees are flattish quarter-over-quarter and even taking into account
some of the [indiscernible] (00:27:03). So, it sounds like a lot of it is just timing with the next kind of 12 to 24
months, hopefully we'll see the benefit of the revenue on the yet to be installed business.
Can you help us frame and sort of size the revenue pool attached to the $2.7 trillion on yet to be installed? And
then within that, maybe hit on the pricing dynamics as well. I think in your comments, you said the – you continue
to see kind of normal pricing headwinds in the business. I think it's been kind of in the 2% to 3% range long term.
Is that sort of the headwind we're still talking about? Or has that changed? Thanks.

Alex, let me – thanks for the question. Let me answer them maybe in reverse order. I think we continue to see the
normalized pricing headwinds in the marketplace. We feel they're well controlled. We feel like they're
understandable, they're logical. And that headwind is back down to about 2%, which is the historical norm.
And a lot of that is how we go to market, how we engage with clients, how we now have added more feature
functionality to our offering, Alpha is a big part of that, of course. And the duration of some of these deals will, I
think, help reinforce that over time.
We are very pleased, I think, as you could expect, with the wins this quarter, last quarter or the first quarter for
that matter. And they're certainly in the range of the fee rates that we have for the company.
We don't – I think we don't feel comfortable going into individual deals or individual quarters on that. But they are
in that range that you see – that you broadly see on average. And that gives us confidence that as this business
get installed, it's going to have a meaningful impact to revenues.
We've been clear we need about $1.5 trillion plus of AUC/A wins. We need that at current or around the fee rates
that we have creates the right amount of gross revenue wins as well, which then get implemented over time. So,
that's why we put that benchmark out there.
And what I would say is, while I think we've had, until this year, a couple of lighter years in terms of sales, we
need to continue the momentum we've been building. And part of the reason we referenced the pipeline is we feel
comfortable with the pipeline. And we see maybe not another $3.2 trillion of AUC/A wins, but at least substantial
wins embedded in the pipeline for us to continue this momentum into next year.

Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Sorry. I was on mute. Thanks for taking my question. I'd like to start maybe with BBH. Could you talk about what
you would expect the impact of that acquisition could do to your asset sensitivity? And how the inclusion or pro
forma balance sheet would be sensitive to 100-basis-point shift in rates?
And then also, to help contextualize investors, Eric, you've had discussed on the M&A call that the cost savings
assumption is conservative. What's a historical range for the right way to think about expenses for these types of
deals? Thanks.

Sure. Let me start on the deposit side, and then we'll leg into the other part of the P&L. And obviously, it's early
with Brown Brothers' Investment Services (sic) [Investor Services] (00:31:23). We're now – we've now gotten our
regulatory filings in. We're obviously working through the closing process and would – are continuing to target a
year-end close.

In terms of asset sensitivity, I think it's a little early to model it too finely, but I think I would say is that the asset
sensitivity of the book is probably in the range of what we have at State Street just because it's similar asset
management-oriented clients. They have similar expectations of deposits and deposit pricing, and I think you get
similar betas and – well, similar betas and adjustments overall.
I think what's different, Brennan, and constructive here is because of the Brown Brothers bank sweep program,
we have more flexibility than usual to either bring in deposits at attractive rates and so that could, in a way,
enhance our asset sensitivity, though you have to be careful by the – you have to model that in or it could let us
protect the size of the balance sheet and the leverage constraint – leverage ratio constraints that we have, which
also led us adjust some amount of preferred securities that we need to run the business.
So, I'd say, overall, it's probably in the same ballpark, but with an ability, through the rate cycle, to either add
deposits and NII or to manage leverage. And I think that's a constructive program and a new functionality that
they bring to us and one that will continue.
In terms of the expense guide, I did say I was hopeful it'd be a bit on the conservative side. I think the expense
guide was for a reduction of about 25%. So, kind of, I think, on the lower end of what we've achieved before. I
think – but it's hard to compare to past deals too – I guess, too forcefully because every deal is different. We need
to bring this business on, and I've said in the past, we've not always finished what we've started and made sure
that all the integration happens and all the functionality that we bring in from an acquisition gets fully integrated
and created in our own offering.
And I think that's why it's been at the lower end of our expense savings targets. But I think there's – we'll see. I
think it's early. I think we'll be – we'll certainly give guidance as to some of those cost estimates in January, and
we'll certainly keep you posted. But we stand by the guidance. And as the CFO, I'm hopeful we can – we certainly
want to meet those. And I always like to exceed where I can, but I think it's a little early to lean too far.

Ronald Philip O'Hanley A

Hey, Brennan, it's Ron. What I would just add to that is we've emphasized about this acquisition. It is about
capabilities and geographic reach and talent. So, as we think about the synergies here, we're thinking about them
as combined synergies, if you will. I mean there's instances where there's just some better capabilities that exist
over at Brown Brothers.

Brennan Hawken Q

Great. Thanks for all that color. And then for my second question, Ron – actually, Eric, when you provided the
color on the fourth quarter expense expectation, you made reference to some needs to invest and whatnot. I
know it's probably early. You're probably just starting to work on the budget for 2022. But cost inflation is very
much on the minds of investors. We hear about it broadly. One of your competitors, at a recent conference, raised
a point that there would probably be some upward expense pressure in 2022. Should we begin to prepare for a bit
of a lift? Is it appropriate maybe to use the fourth quarter as the jumping off point and then adjust for seasonality

and then think about that into next year? Is there just some general guiding principles you could provide to help
people level set on 2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. Brennan, let me start on that, okay? Because we are definitely seeing instances where there is some cost
pressure, but it'd be untrue to say that it's across the board. Certain types of employees, for example, in the
technology area as you'd expect, because there we're not just competing with other custody banks, we're
competing with technology firms. So, we are definitely seeing that.
But we also continue to see productivity improvements in our business. We're engineering them in. So, we do see
an ability to offset some, if not all that. And we're just going to be careful about how we proceed forward. We don't
want to underinvest in key staff. But we also think that – I mean, as we see performance, we can pay for
performance and do it through the incentive line. So, it's something we're watching out for. And there are
particular areas where we are seeing the need to raise the fixed cost of talent, but not at an overwhelming – we're
not seeing an overwhelming kind of thing yet. Eric, you probably want to add something.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, State Street Corp.
Yeah. Brennan, I'd add to that, you go through the line items of expenses, Ron covered the salary, comp,
incentives. And obviously, we have a little pressure there, but we also have a little more attrition. I think
everyone's seeing that as they – so we're trying to – we need to net that out as we go into next year.
I think you see a little bit of creep on the tech side, obviously, some of those cost and transactional costs. But
again, we have our engineering programs to offset some of that. And while it means there's more work to do,
there's always more work to do. That's just how it plays out.
I think from a – if you step back and you say what are the guiding principles that we use as we go into our budget
process, which has just really started and full swing in November and then comes through in December is really
about how do we continue to make healthy or solid progress in expanding margin each year? How do we do that
with positive operating leverage? And you've heard me say before, we don't like to live on the edge and be too
hopeful of an equity market tailwind or something of that sort. And so, I think you've got to think of it as
commitment to progressing towards our medium-term targets and progressing at pace where we can make
progress each year. You've seen us, notwithstanding the interest rate headwinds this year, we're making progress
this year towards those targets. We're proud of that, and we need to – feel like we need to continue that.

Hi, Betsy.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. So, two questions, one, I think on the expense side, one of the reasons why there are so many questions
here is that, there had been a period where State Street had a tougher time delivering positive operating leverage.
And then more recently, you've had very good success. So, when I hear the point about, hey, we're going to be
reinvesting a bit for future growth, I'm just wondering is this a message we should take that the investment spend
was a bit under – you underinvested over the past year-and-a-half and now we're going to ramp back up to
"normal" or is this more of a temporary, we've got some things, specific opportunities that we need to invest in, we
can't tell you how many quarters it's going to take, but it's more of a specific opportunity, and the positive
operating leverage we've been used to seeing recently will persist once we get through this period. I guess that's
part of the reason why there's so many questions on expenses. And if we could frame it like that, would there be
any more color you could share with us? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Betsy, it's Ron. So, we've been – we certainly have not been underinvesting in our business, and whether it's
inorganic or organic. I mean, obviously, there's Charles River, more recently, Brown Brothers on an inorganic
basis. But as we've tried to emphasize quarter-over-quarter, every time we've talked about us keeping expenses
flat or even down, that's been done by a fairly aggressive engineering effort to bring down BAU expenses, while
also continuing to invest in the business, particularly in the technology area.
In terms of future investments, we just see the momentum building in areas where we've already started to invest
and there's opportunity to invest more and accelerate growth. And the three areas that we highlighted were, one,
just continuing to invest in Alpha and kind of bring more and more of that to market quicker. Second is private
markets. And then third is the whole digital space, where you're seeing a lot of activity there. And that's a
combination of both supporting our clients in their digital kinds of ventures and also continuing to go to the next
stage of digitization of our own business. So, that's what we're talking about there.
And, again, I would underscore what I said at the end of my prepared remarks that we will do so with a
commitment to positive operating leverage and continued margin expansion over the short to medium term.

That's great color. And those three threads, those are top of our list too in terms of revenue-generating growth
potential over the next three to five years. So, that seems like it makes a lot of sense to be investing for that.
Maybe a little bit more quarterly-oriented kind of question. But just on the loan growth that you saw in the quarter,
I just want to get a sense as to key drivers of that growth. And should we think that it was specific to this quarter,
or there is a demand there that we'll likely see that kind of growth continue as we look into next year? Thanks.

Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, State Street Corp.
Betsy, it's Eric. It's a little bit of both, actually. We saw higher than usual opportunities this quarter. I think,
sequentially, our loan balances were up; we're talking $3 billion, that's quite a bit on a $30 billion base of loans. A
little bit of that was some discretionary lending we do, and then some of it was literally higher demand from private
equity capital call financing. Obviously as the alternatives markets continues to boom, some of our classic fund
finance clients were looking for some support and so forth.
So, I think it was a higher than usual quarterly print. I think year-on-year, what we're seeing is some confidence
that we can grow this loan book in the low double-digits, which is nice. The one thing we are conscious of, though,
is with loans comes RWA. And so, what we're always doing in background is optimizing the risk-weighted asset
and the returns mix of those loans to make sure that in some cases we add; in other cases, we sell fund by
optimizing other positions, and that'll be part of how we think about it going forward. But we do think of lending as
an opportunity for us to drive NII in the coming quarters and years.

Operator: Your next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Hello, guys. I wonder if you could expand on the NII discussion. Just talk about what you think are non-operating
excess deposits right now and how you think they behave [indiscernible] (00:45:07) model them behaving in a
modestly rising world as we go into next year. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, State Street Corp.
Yeah, Glenn, it's a really good and hard question because there's not an easy answer to them. I think we clearly
have, like others have had, some amount of excess deposits flow in. What I would say, though, is if you go back,
call it, two years, you can ask the question, is that the typical deposits and is all the increase excess? And I'd say
that's not true.
What we've had over the last two years is very significant growth in our AUC/As. And with AUC/As, right, clients
need to leave a certain amount of cash with us to handle the transaction volumes. And so, a good bit of the
increase that we've seen over the last couple of years is on the core deposit side. There is, though, some, as
you've seen, that is excess. And we pulled off, I think, a reasonable amount this quarter. We don't necessarily
want to push down deposits too far because we do want to be there for our clients.
If you go from – with that context to the – I think the next part of your question, which is what happens in either
tighter monetary policy with a slower expansion of the Fed's balance sheet or rising rates, does that reverse the
15

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2021
course of deposits? I think it will eventually, but I think it'll be a while. It'll be a two to three-year process for that to
happen. And part of the reason I say that is the Fed continues, even under a tapering, to expand its balance
sheet, right? They're just expanding it less is what the talk is all about. It's not about actually stopping the
expansion of its balance sheet.
And so, as the Fed continues to expand its balance sheet and then signal rising rates, I think we're probably going
to be in an environment of having healthy deposit levels, which effectively mean they're core, right, partly driven
by the AUC/A need and partly driven by just the surplus of cash in the system and rising rates, which I think would
be positive to certainly our balance sheet and NII and to the – to other banks as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Glenn Schorr Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
I appreciate that. I wonder if you could just expand a little bit more on your thoughts. You mentioned private
markets is one of the key growth areas. You're one of the pioneers on the custody side of that. What does
Mercatus do for you? And what can and can't you do right now for the expanding world of private markets?
Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, State Street Corp.
Yeah. And private markets is a broad area, which is why I think we see some opportunities. If you recall, there's
hedge fund activity in private markets, there is classic private equity, there's more fixed income kind of loan-
oriented private markets, there's real estate. And so, it's in each of those areas where there's not one investment
we need to make, but a series as we pick our spots and pick our spots not only across each of those products,
but make some choices geographically as well.
What Mercatus brings is a set of front-end functionality that we can use to support our private equity and other
private market clients, so functionality around reporting to LPs, reporting to their own partnership. And that's the
front end that I think we value. And with that comes a set of data feeds and communication that's quite valuable.
And if you think about that, that is – directly plugs into the historical custodial operation that we provide and why
we're so excited about it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Hey, Glenn, what I would add to this, that market is still largely a in-sourced market. So, this isn't about slugging it
out with competitors and a race to the bottom on fees, it's to be able to demonstrate a better offering than what
these institutions are doing for themselves.
The stakes are going up for them in terms of data reporting, particularly in ESG reporting. It's not just that
investors are demanding it, but in some cases, particularly outside the US and Europe, you're seeing reporting
requirements being imposed not just on public companies but on private companies. And investors want to know
what's in their portfolio, including their private portfolio. So, we think this is all going to be – and Mercatus helps us
do that, and this will all be further impetus to drive this to a more outsourced model.

Operator: Your next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
Thanks. Good morning. Hey, Eric, just want a couple of cleanups here. So, you said that the premium am was
improved, but you've called it episodic, but just wanted to understand, like what was that premium am number in
the third quarter so we can understand. I think you said it would continue to improve. So I just want to understand
what the delta was this quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, State Street Corp.
Yeah. I think the best way to describe it, Ken, is remember, every quarter, we get some headwind from the
compression in underlying yields in the portfolio. And what offsets that is less and less premium amortization,
which comes through as a negative, but it's a smaller negative each quarter.
And this past quarter, I said about a third of the $20 million improvement was from, I'll describe as an excess
reduction in premium amortization. And that's the piece we don't expect to repeat. We do, as I said, continue to
expect some marginal headwinds in the underlying portfolio yields. We do expect some ongoing reduction in
premium amortization, not just at that same level. And then we've also been pleased with some of what we've
been able to do on the balance sheet asset size around lending and the investment portfolio. And that's why we
took our range up.
But we're a little conscious that the fourth quarter print, we gave a range purposely. We don't think the third
quarter print is necessarily a perfect indicator of that. But, all that said, I think we're pleased with the direction that
NII has taken over the last couple quarters, and we think that sets us up for the future as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company
So, do you have a number to give us versus the $157 million in the second quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, State Street Corp.
I think you'll have to help me. I think in the second quarter, we had NII of $467 million; in the third quarter, $487
million. And I think the range I gave you was $475 million to $490 for the – for fourth quarter. That's total NII. I
think what I'm trying to message is there are pieces below the surface, and we could get into a great amount of
detail, but that's kind of where the net falls out.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies & Company

Sure. In the third quarter, the money market fee waivers were about $19 million. Back in the second quarter, they
were close to $25 million. And that's why we thought at current levels of front-end rates, which have stabilized, we
said that fourth quarter is likely to be around the $19 million, $20 million that we just saw.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q

the third?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, State Street Corp.
I think we're focused – the biggest driver of money market fee waivers in our systems for GA, for our Global
Advisors business, that's the one we've spent the most time tracking, I think, is material, I think the – and
dominates. So, I think that's the area to focus on.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. First one is just on the asset servicing side. Eric, if you can maybe just sort
of maybe give us a view on that step-up of asset servicing fee growth at legacy State Street, not including Brown
Brothers in 2022 and 2023, given that the new wins have been so strong and you're running at more than double
the pace required to offset the pricing headwinds. So, I mean, I guess the short question here is should we expect
a step-up in organic growth of asset servicing in 2022 and again in 2023 given that pipeline and not factoring in
any kind of – or ignoring the market side of it?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, State Street Corp.
Brian, it's Eric. I think it's a little early to get out and start to forecast 2022 and 2023. I think what I was trying to
signal is we're very pleased with our sales performance this year what we've been able to book. And that clearly
is going to be part of the components of delivering growth in 2022 and 2023.
I would say we – and I've said this before, we need to earn our keep every quarter by continuing to drive sales
and wins. And you saw that in the first quarter, we had $343 million of AUC/A wins. We're very pleased with that.
We're pleased again with the second quarter, with the third quarter. We need to keep at it because if you step
back, remember, a portion of every year's wins gets implemented in that particular year. It's something like a third.
About two-thirds of a year's wins typically is – gets reported in the following calendar year. And then you still have
some, it's probably like a sixth in the year after that.

So, we're in a business where what we [indiscernible] (00:56:36) we then start to implement and then we need to
keep up that progress, and that's what drives growth. And so, I'd say we're on a good trajectory. We're pleased
with this year's successes and we'd like to continue to be successful. And we expect to be given our pipeline, but
it's still early to forecast actual growth for next year and the year after.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brian Bedell Q
Analyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Okay. That's fair enough. And then, Ron, just back on SSGA, obviously, you made a good case for the
growth in that business longer term. But as you just think of strategically State Street as a whole, obviously,
you've been the clear and away leader in the core asset servicing business. And your – you continue to enhance
that lead with CRD and BBH and other investments for organically growing it.
So, as you think about State Street longer term, maybe would you prefer to be more of a pure play on that
leadership position? Or would you prefer to have the balance of the asset management business within that? And
I guess, also, is it really critical that you need SSGA for preferential capital treatment for going through the Fed
stress test and CCAR?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Well, Brian, I mean, if you think about our portfolio of businesses, we're far and away the narrowest of both the
US and the total G-SIFI population. So, we're pretty focused to begin with. And if you think about those two broad
businesses – because I would put markets underneath our investment servicing business because it's really there
to support that business. So, if you think about those two businesses, they really are – they fall under that single
purpose of helping institutional investors achieve better outcomes.
So, we start out from a position of being very focused. And then we ask ourselves all the time, first, are we
satisfied with our performance? And second, are we the right owner for these businesses? And at this point, as
we look at it, we think and believe that given the performance, given the somewhat symbiotic relationship
between two businesses that having this participation in that business is actually enhancing.
And as you note, it certainly is helpful from a capital perspective and relative to our investment servicing and
related activities, it's a capital-light business. So, when you add it all together, we like the business, but we
recognize that you as shareholders can take care of diversification, and it's not up to us to diversify for you. We
have to make sure that as owners of these businesses that we're good owners, and we can continue to grow the
business, and we are looking at this all the time.

Q3 2021 Earnings Call 18-Oct-2021
Hey, good morning. Maybe just on the security servicing side, outside of one-off large outflows like the BlackRock
biz, can you speak to your efforts to reduce client attrition and kind of get that $1.5 trillion bogey of annual gross
outflows down to really start to enhance the net growth from that side of the equation?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, State Street Corp.
Jim, it's Eric. Let me start. There is a long history here in serving our clients, serving them well and being
incredibly focused on what they need. And that's what both create sales and sales opportunity because we've
said over time, something like two-thirds, three quarters of our sales come from our existing clients. And the other
side of that coin is staying close to our clients, understanding their needs, being there when they add funds or
when they consider other options, is also a big part of what we do.
Now, sometimes our clients are involved in M&A, and we need to rebid what we've got. And so, we have very
active programs when that happens. And that's part of the industry. We've got a set of client NPS, Net Promoter
Score work that we do, that we've expanded over the last two years to now take on a very large portion of our
clients. So, that provides real-time feedback to us from the C-suite on down to the operational portions of our
clients.
And then it's our coverage program. I think you saw us back in June describe how we do coverage with our
Global Client division, our premium, our preferred and each one of them is geared towards making sure that we're
staying close and supporting our clients and making sure they're as satisfied and – as can be. So, those are some
of the elements, and I'd say it's deep in our culture and something we work on.
That said, you've got to keep – if we want to grow and deliver core growth like we've done in the last few quarters,
we've been able to drive core growth, which we're very pleased with, we got to keep expanding and selling both to
existing and to new clients. And you've seen us do that successfully. And then on the other side, we – I think, we
feel quite good about our retention rates and that will be – that's always an area of intense effort and I'd say this
year has been successful as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James Mitchell Q
Analyst, Seaport Research Partners
Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just a second question on enhanced custody. If I look at the – if I'm reading the
balance sheet correctly, it seems like you've had very significant growth there. Is there any constraints on growing
that business from a balance sheet perspective, capital perspective? How we think about the – what's driving the
growth and the outlook for that over the next year or two?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, State Street Corp.
Sure. Jim, it's Eric again. I think for all of our balance sheet businesses, we always need to be careful about how
much they consume in risk-weighted assets versus the earnings and the opportunities that they can provide us.
We do that certainly on a standalone basis because you've got to look at every asset on the balance sheet,
whether it's lending asset for our loan book, for example, or securities finance business or enhanced custody
business or FX business.
And then you also have to think about it within the context of the client relationship because there's always a give
and take and for a client that may not borrow very much, where they do more securities finance for enhanced
custody, that can be a reasonable mix and a way to serve them, but to serve them with decent returns.

So, I'd say there's certainly room in these businesses, but I think what we are doing is going into the end of the
year as we close the Brown Brothers acquisition. We are being a bit disciplined about our risk-weighted asset
position, right, because we want to close that deal, and we want to land within our capital ratios. And so, I think
while you've seen some very heavy growth in the last couple of quarters, just in the next one to two quarters, I
think you'll see – you'll continue to see some discipline.
You've seen a little bit of that on the quarter-on-quarter balance sheet in some of the areas like securities finance.
And you can imagine we'll do that going into the beginning of next year. But what I would say is I think the
franchise as we continue to grow the fee portion of the revenue base, manage our expenses, we can continue to
put more capital to work over time, but sometimes there'll be some ebbs and flows. And I think I've given you a
little bit of an indication where we see some of those.

Hi, good morning. So, Eric, I wanted to start off just discussing some comments you made actually a bit ago at the
BAB conference. You talked about the servicing fee growth algorithm, and you framed it based on expectations
around new store and same-store sales growth, pricing pressures, what have you. And I was hoping you can
maybe just update us on how your thinking has evolved with regard to that algorithm, whether it's strengthened
just given the improved outcomes that we're seeing in terms of new business wins, at least relative to what you've
seen historically?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, State Street Corp.
Yeah, Steve, I think the algorithm that you're referring to that we've – that I've described and we've described as a
company is that servicing fee growth comes from a mix of equity market tailwinds, client activity inflows, net new
business, we can either be positive as it has been the last couple of quarters, neutral or negative and then pricing
headwinds, right? It's that four-part structure.
I think the way I'd update that is to say that the structure is still there and I think been fortified. I think the different
areas move around a bit. I think equity market tailwinds, we've seen very strong equity market tailwinds this year.
I don't think we're going to see that every year, but we'd like to see flat to up equity market. So, you can imagine
that part of the tailwind was very positive this year, which we're pleased with. And the way we monetized that is
we didn't take our expenses up with equity market uptick.
The second one is client flows and activities. I think a couple of years back, this was a positive by a couple points.
I think a year or two ago, as we saw outflows from packaged products in both – especially in the US as mutual
funds were on the wane, and we saw less inflows in Europe, I think we felt less confident in client activity and
flows as the tailwind. I think that's actually rebounded nicely this year, and we expect that to continue given the
current market dynamics.

Net new business, as you referenced, I think we've got a strong year here in terms of wins. That will now start to
get implemented next year and the year after. So, that takes time, but we're pleased with the backlog.
And then pricing, I think, as I've said, I think, on the first question this morning, has been well controlled, and we
just work on that intensely every day. So, I think the structure is intact. Every year will bring a little different mix
and different elements of the – of that framework.

Thanks for that color, Eric. And just for my follow-up, I know you provided some helpful color on the BBH rate
sensitivity, additional flex from having the off-balance sheet [ph] suite up (01:08:47) option. I was just curious how
the improving rate backdrop, just taking the forward curve, informs your willingness to onboard more than the $10
billion of deposits, which you disclosed at the time of the deal and just speak to the relative attractiveness of
onboarding a larger percentage of deposits versus maybe other forms of capital return, like buybacks and
dividend increase.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, State Street Corp.
Sure. And let me open up the aperture a little bit. Remember, the core of our capital constraint is around CET1,
right, our common equity Tier 1 ratio, which is really a risk-weighted asset-based measure, not a leverage ratio
measure. So, on the leverage ratio, we just need to be kind of within bounds. And so, the decision on deposits
and NII within reason is really around what rate levels we're sitting at.
I think the way to think about deposits is when prevailing short rates, call it, Fed funds is at the current levels, near
zero, you're not incentive to have deposits on the balance sheet. That breakeven tends to flip at around two or
three rate hikes, around 75 basis points of Fed funds. You start to be in a more neutral position and at 100 basis
points of Fed funds, you start to be the right way around or you'd prefer the deposits on the balance sheet. And so
it's somewhere in that area, call it, two, three rate hikes from now, where we begin to seriously thinking about the
benefit of adding more deposits instead of being – instead of holding them off.
And so, I think the question that we will – the decision criteria that we'll get to is where are prevailing rates in the
first quarter and the second quarter and the third quarter next year, and at that point, we'll make some conscious
decisions and trade off additional NII, which we'd like to bring in because it helps with our margin and our EPS.
And we'll just have to just be careful about the balance sheet size. But you've seen us manage the balance sheet
size. You saw it this quarter. And in fact, it's not like we – well, we know where to judiciously manage the balance
sheet. I think we'll continue to do that while bringing on deposits and serving our clients as best we can.

Good morning, Ron, good morning, Eric.

Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Hi, Gerard.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Eric, can you share with us when you guys look at your asset under custody wins, can you break it out
geographically? And also, are the wins coming from competitors? Or are they coming from just companies that
were doing it internally and now have chosen to go with somebody like yourself? And how do the numbers in this
quarter look compared to the prior couple of years? Is there shifts going on in either of those two dynamics?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah, Gerard, maybe I'll begin and Eric will add in color. If you look at this quarter, the standout, obviously, from
an AUC/A was Legal & General. So, mostly UK, but some – there's an American element to that also. In that
case, it was, for the most part, a new client to us. We did not have – we had a nominal existing relationship to it.
And it's an Alpha-driven mandate. So, lots of activities will be coming our way over time.
If you look at the prior quarter, again, the standout there would have been Invesco, which was more of a US-
based global client, where we had an existing relationship on the servicing side, we are consolidating much of that
and expanding into the middle and front office.
So, I would say that what we've seen over the past couple of years in terms of the Alpha-related kinds of wins, it's
been nicely mixed geographically. And as importantly, it's been – there's been more new client wins than we
would have expected from the beginning. So it's enabled us to drive new client growth. And what's incumbent
upon us then is to make sure that, obviously, if it's a new client, they've got the traditional servicing business with
somebody else. So, what we are doing strategically is we'll have the discussion on Alpha, we'll win the Alpha, and
then say now we want to move the servicing business over.
In terms of the core wins, I would say that there's been a little bit of a cycle here, and Eric will correct me if I'm
getting this wrong. But after – if you go back a couple – three years ago, EMEA was relatively light relative to the
US, and we've seen actually over the past couple years a lot of activity in EMEA. And it's not so much that it's
been less US; it's just been more activity in EMEA. So, that had a lot to do with changing out and rebuilding a
sales force and things like that that had been done in the US, hadn't quite been done until more recently in EMEA.
So, what we like is it's nicely mixed.
And more recently, we're starting to see some activity in Asia-Pacific, and we're really excited about Brown
Brothers because of the truly leading position that they have in Japan that we'll be able to leverage to spur even
more growth there.

Thank you. Very good. As a follow-up question, and I apologize if you guys have addressed this already, in the
revenue growth of servicing fees and management fees, 7% for servicing on a year-over-year basis, 10% for
management, you mentioned that client flows, new business growth, higher market levels contributed to this
growth. How much of that growth was attributed to the higher market levels?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, State Street Corp.
Gerard, it's Eric. It varies by business. On servicing fees, a large proportion of the up 7% was driven by the equity
markets tailwind, a smaller proportion from client flows and net new business. And then in the other direction, you
have the usual smaller amount of pricing headwinds, and we also called out a little bit of divestiture activity. So it's
kind of two-thirds/one-third. But what I think I'm particularly pleased with is we're able to hold expenses flat,
notwithstanding that. And that's not been our history here, as we've managed.
On the management fee side, it was just the way that business tends to be priced. The market tailwinds tend to
come in and are a very important part of the tailwind. But we also had, I think, very nice net new business
performance on the revenue side. You see it in flows. We also counted in revenues. But you saw there us taking
up our margin in the asset management business. And so, while we're creating the environment for either an
equity market tailwind or a flow tailwind in asset management, we're also managing the other side of the P&L, and
that's been quite remunerative for us this quarter and pleasing.

Robert Wildhack Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research LLP
Good morning, guys. Just one more on the expense side, you highlighted some productivity savings this quarter,
and that's been a trend recently. How much more is there left to do on the productivity side? And how much do
you think that can continue to serve as an offset to any increases in other expenses going forward?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Hey, Rob, service productivity is hard work. And we have been at it now for a couple of years. And despite the
progress that we see, we actually see more opportunities. It's not as easy as just in – like in manufacturing, just
substitute a people-driven assembly line with a bunch of robots. It's really activity by activity, substituting AI,
substituting other kinds of automation, trying to eliminate reconciliations. And we're making progress against that
and we see the opportunity to do more. So, we see this as it requires work, ongoing work and ongoing
engineering. But we see opportunities over the next several years to continue to do more and more of this.

Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, State Street Corp.
And Rob, it's Eric. I'd just add, as we adjusted our outlook a little bit, part of that was just year-end incentives. We
need to reward really strong performance, but we also talked about starting to leg into investments. And we like to
invest behind the revenue, not ahead of the revenue, but behind the revenue, and that's what we're doing. One of
those investments, to be honest, is engineering work, right, development work to actually automate processes,
simplify processes, and so forth.
And so, part of what we're doing even into the fourth quarter is beginning some of that work, so that several
quarters from now, a year from now, two years from now, there's actually an engineering benefit. And so that's
where it comes together as well. But as Ron said, it takes real hard work and it gets done in phases.

Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi Ron. Hi, Eric. Couple of questions for you folks on BBH acquisition, I remember you saying on the
announcement of the call something about earn-outs. Can you talk a little bit about, are these – is this additional
payment over and above the purchase price? Or is it something else for the partners who would have presumably
gotten a part of that purchase price and cash that you're getting? Or can you give us some color on that? And
what the driver of that – what is it tied to and over what time period?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah, Vivek, so there's not an extra contingent payment here. So, let's put that aside. But what we have put in
place, and it was part of our – as we talked about expected accretion here, we have put in place an incentive plan
that's quite broad-based. Basically, it's a success-based pool with the factors being client onboarding and
retention, as well as staff retention.
And everybody – well, all of senior management fairly deep into the BBH management participates in that. And
there's targets out there in terms of client retention, there's targets out there in terms of desired staff retention. So,
it was really meant to align BBH people around what we're aligned about, which is growing our client base and
keeping our best talent.

And Vivek, it's Eric. You'll see those costs in the acquisition restructuring line. So we're purposely bounding it but
including it in our financials. But they're modest. They're what you'd expect us or any other acquirer to do in a
deal. And given the combination, there's a real benefit in the execution here.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Vivek Juneja Q
Analyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay, great. Another one on BBH, and Eric, maybe this is more for you. The BBH sweep program that you
mentioned previously, too, how much of those deposits – how much of that sweep is at risk with banks not – who
would not want to renew it because of capital constraints? So how much of that would you need to take on? And if
you couldn't, what's the alternative to that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, State Street Corp.
Yeah, Vivek, as part of our diligence, we looked at every part of this acquisition, how the revenues come together
there, where there's a lot of share of wallet opportunity, expenses, how it comes together, and certainly the sweep
program. The sweep program is modest when it comes to the bank counterparties. It's not enormous for any one
bank provider. I think the top 10 bank providers are important. But if you think about what swept away, I think we
said about $60 billion, $70 billion is swept away today across 10 large banks. You're not talking about a real
capacity constraint.
And we did – we have done and we've actually engaged with each of those bank counterparties, most of whom
we know extremely well and who we do business with, right? We often do business with those counterparties on
the sub-custody side or in terms of other arrangements. And so, there's kind of a – there's a bidirectional set of
relationships that we have.
So, we don't see a lot of risk at this point and see more of an opportunity to actually sweep a little more, sweep a
little less. What I would say is the core of the sweep is in US dollar and I don't need to be patriotic to say that the
US dollar is an extremely valuable deposit and cash currency. And so, that's – so they're certainly valuable to US
and global banks. And so, I think we've got a good program set up, and we see it continuing with some upside
optionality for us.

Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi. If you can provide more color on your phrase, business investment for the next phase of growth. That sounds
like something more significant than simply tweaking budgets going into year-end or anything like that. So, when
you talk about this next phase of growth, I know you talked about Alpha, private markets, the digital space, but if
26

you maybe just give more color on the overall tech strategy and the tech budget. How much are you looking to
increase the tech budget from where it is now? How much of that is to change the bank? And which areas of tech
are you investing such as the cloud or other areas? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Well, Mike, as I said – it's Ron. As I said earlier, we've been investing all along through this most recent period,
these last several years. And as Eric has noted, we've invested behind our revenue growth. So, the gates in our
investment have not been necessarily opportunities, it's been what can we do to fund this growth off of our BAU
spending. And second, where and how is the growth coming in.
In terms of what we're investing in, it really isn't changing much other than from a balance perspective, I would
say that much of the investment that you've seen over the past several years, if you think about the whole
resilience area, the whole – I mean, this is imposed on all of us, resilience area, the cyber area would probably fall
under the BAU or run the bank. Alpha has certainly been a change the bank kind of thing. And I think there's a –
we would anticipate a little bit of a mix shift from run to change in terms of total amounts. But really, it's not going
to be a kind of peanut butter of thing where everybody gets a little something here for their pet project. It really is
about those things where we see it positioning us for meaningful growth, meaningful additional growth. So, we've
explained why, but that would be Alpha, private markets and State Street Digital kind of primarily.
What I would add to that, with the continuing to selectively invest in Global Advisors, I mean, the investments
we've made there in the past, particularly, for example, in the active ETF space, what we've – the investments we
made in European ETFs and then low-cost ETFs, all of which are growing, and we're gathering disproportionate
share in those space. So, that's how we think about it.
I mean, you shouldn't expect us to be throwing a lot of money at things that we don't know anything about or that
are new to us, but it's about things that we've already established can give us growth and that with a little more
investment, we expect to be able to accelerate that growth.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. So, spread around the peanut butter too much. But when you look at it by function, like I know you've – this
predates you, Ron, but when you talk about the cloud or the back office and you talk about digitizing your
operations, how are you looking at the cloud today in terms of public, private? How much of the workload has
shifted? Where are you in that thought process? And how much does that play as part of your transformation?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
I mean, Mike, we've been very active in the cloud and we've I think, talked about this in other context. If you – I'll
use an example of what we're doing in Charles River and Alpha, which is an entirely a – right from the beginning
when we said we were going to be open architecture and interoperable, that by definition meant that it had to be
cloud-based. So, we have quite aggressively gone to the cloud. We've talked about our partnership, which was
one of the first in this whole security services area with Microsoft and their Azure products. So, that is very much a
part of it, and we think about it as being how can we – I mean, certainly, there's a cost element to it but it's also
about how do we advance the business strategically and grow revenues.

Rajiv Bhatia Q
Analyst, Morningstar, Inc. (Research)
Good morning. Just one quick question from me, there's some headlines that hedge fund flows are pretty strong.
So, can you comment on your alternative fund administration business? And what kind of growth are you seeing
there?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ronald Philip O'Hanley A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, State Street Corp.
Yeah. Why don't I begin and Eric will pick up, Rajiv? I mean you're right. Hedge fund flows have been strong and
going back to Mike's effort, that would be another example of where we've invested fairly significantly in new
technology there, and in this case, using an outside provider. And we're enjoying the benefits of those flows. And I
think that you will see – we expect to see more and more flows into alternatives, alternatives of all types. There is
a further push to see this, if you will, go into smaller, smaller accounts and the so-called democratization of it, and
we want to be positioned for that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Eric W. Aboaf A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, State Street Corp.
And Rajiv, it's Eric. I'd just add the private markets, the hedge funds are all attractive asset classes for us. And so
year-on-year, we saw a 7% growth this year across the servicing fee franchise. In the private markets, you're
seeing 2, 3-percentage-point higher growth than the average for the company. And that's one of the reasons why
over the last year or two and certainly going into the fourth quarter next year, we're investing more in private
markets because we see those opportunities, and that adds to the growth trajectory of the company.
