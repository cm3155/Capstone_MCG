MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator: Welcome to the Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. My name is Lisa, and I will be your operator for
today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer
session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the call over to Alicia Charity. You may begin.

Alicia Charity
Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Amerprise Financial, Inc.
Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial's third quarter earnings call. On the call with me
today are: Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer. Following their
remarks, we'd be happy to take your questions.
Turning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website, on slide 2, you will see a
discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically, during the call, you will hear references to various non-
GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company's operations. Reconciliation of non-
GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials and on our website.
Some statements that we make on this call may be forward looking, reflecting management's expectations about
future events and overall operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of
today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause
actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our third quarter earnings
release and our 2021 annual report to shareholders, and our 2021 10-K report. We make no obligation to publicly
update or revise these forward-looking statements.
On slide 3, you see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the third quarter. Below that, you'll see
our adjusted operating results, followed by operating results excluding unlocking, which management believes
enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and
facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. We completed our annual unlocking in the third quarter. Many of the
comments that management makes on the call today will focus on adjusted operating results.
And with that, we'll turn it over to Jim.

Good morning and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. What I'd like to do is give you my perspective on
the environment and how Ameriprise is performing. Then Walter will cover the financials.
In terms of the market environment, both equity and fixed income markets continued to decline in the third
quarter, both here and in Europe. Inflation remains high and sticky and geopolitical risk is elevated. This is
causing a high level of volatility, keeping investors on the sidelines a bit more.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
With that, short-term interest rates were up 300 basis points so far this year, with 150 basis points raised just in
the third quarter. I believe that the Fed and other central banks have been playing catch up and that they will have
to continue in increasing rates to get inflation under control.
Having said that, it will lead to a slowing of the US and European economies. And at this juncture, it looks more
like we're heading for a mild recession. Therefore, I expect there will be more volatility ahead.
So for Ameriprise, the diversity and strength of our business allows us to deliver good outcomes, even in
challenging times. And you certainly saw that in our results this quarter. We continue to remain in strong client
inflows in Wealth Management. And the rise in interest rates, the growth of the bank, and the stability of the
Retirement & Protection businesses helped to more than offset the effect of depreciating markets and foreign
exchange that impacted our Asset Management business. The investments we made in our business over the
years in our technology, client service, product solutions and advice value proposition are paying dividends as we
continue our strong focus on our clients and helping our advisors navigate a difficult environment.
Now, I'd like to discuss our third quarter results in more detail. Total assets under management and administration
were $1.1 trillion, which is down 9% from a year ago. Assets were impacted by the steep decline in both equity
and fixed income markets and the strength of the dollar, which affected the foreign exchange rate in our European
business.
In terms of adjusted operating financials, excluding unlocking, revenues were $3.5 billion, up 1%. With that,
earnings per share were up 9% to $6.43. And the return on equity was strong at 47.9%, which is consistent with
this time last year.
Now, let's talk a bit more about our businesses. I'll start with Advice & Wealth Management, where we continue to
deliver strong results. Despite the environment, we had good client flows, as clients remained engaged. Total
client flows were up 11% in the quarter to more than $11 billion. The mix of our flows reflect the environment
we're in. We saw strong growth in brokerage, cash, certificates and other products. As we expected, cash
balances continue to be up sharply to more than $46 billion compared to more than $40 billion just a year ago.
We're seeing good growth across our cash offerings.
Very importantly, our advisor productivity remains strong, as we continue to reinforce our personal relationships
and the value of advice. It was up 7% to $819,000 per advisor. We recently met with our top advisors to recognize
their success and discuss growth opportunities at Ameriprise. Engagement was terrific. Advisors are highly
satisfied with the firm and the support we provide. And they like the technology and the capabilities we've added,
which is helping them grow, which brings me to recruiting.
We had another very good quarter, adding 89 highly productive advisors. Advisors consistently tell us they
recognize the strength of our value proposition, our brand and the stability of the firm. It's a competitive
marketplace and I feel good about our pipeline.
In the third quarter, as we have all year, we continue to invest steadily in the business. We continue to release
additional tools, capabilities and enhancements that help our advisors engage and meet with clients, deliver
actionable advice and improve efficiency of their practices.
As part of our investment agenda, we've been very much focused on expanding our cash offering and growing
our bank. The bank provides important flexibility in this rising interest rate environment and will continue to be a
good opportunity for us to further engage and deepen our relationships with clients.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
We continue to move cash to the bank, adding $3.1 billion in the third quarter. And with that, we've been able to
invest appropriately to garner additional spread. Today, our bank has grown to nearly $19 billion. We also
continue to see good growth in our pledge loan business. And we'll be launching more products in the bank as we
move forward.
Overall, the Advice & Wealth Management business continues to generate strong profitable growth and margins
reached 27.8%, up 540 basis points.
Now let's turn to Retirement & Protection Solutions, starting with variable annuities. We have narrowed our focus
to concentrate on products that are good for clients in this environment and for the firm. And with that strategy in
place, we have continued to generate solid sales in variable annuities, without living benefits, as well as our
structured products, as we have shifted away from annuities with guarantees. Therefore, our sales are down, but
in line with the industry.
We also made a shift in Protection, away from fixed insurance to focus on VUL and DI products. Life sales were
also down, given the climate, but, again, results were in line with the industry.
Based on what we've done to appropriately risk-adjust these businesses, they continue to generate good
earnings, stability, and solid returns in cash flow as a complement to our other businesses.
Now, I'll cover Asset Management. As you've seen across the industry, markets have impacted asset levels from
an equity and fixed income perspective. As a global asset manager with sizable presence in Europe, we were
also affected by the appreciation of the sterling and the euro versus the dollar. Assets under management were
down 6% to $546 billion, given the equity and fixed income markets and the FX impact I've mentioned, more than
offsetting the BMO acquisition.
Consistent with what you're seeing in the industry, investors have more of a risk off perspective and you have a
level of tax-loss harvesting taking place, based on market depreciation. Very critically in this environment, we are
maintaining good investment performance and we're continuing to maintain good three, five and 10-year track
records.
While there's been a lot of volatility over the course of the year, over 70% of our funds are above median on an
asset-weighted basis. Our short-term performance has been impacted in some of our fixed income strategies
based on the spike in interest rates. And in Europe, some of our equity strategies were impacted because of our
quality growth positioning.
Let's turn to flows. In the quarter, we had outflows of $2.4 billion that included $1 billion of legacy insurance
partner outflows. Positive flows in institutional were more than offset by the ongoing pressure we've seen in retail.
In retail, overall, we're in net outflows, but it improved a bit from a tougher second quarter for us in the industry.
We ended the third quarter with lower gross sales and higher redemptions than a year ago, given the markets.
This resulted in $5.3 billion of net outflows, driven by weak conditions.
In US retail, equity outflows remain generally in line with the industry and fixed income results were behind, given
our product mix. In EMEA, the retail flows remained under pressure. We did see some improvements in
Continental Europe, and overall flows were a bit better than the industry for the quarter.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
Turning to Global Institutional, excluding legacy insurance partners, net inflows were $3.9 billion. And we're
seeing fundings get extended, given the markets and some asset allocation calls.
In Asset Management, we expect the environment will remain challenging. However, we think there will be
opportunities as markets settle down over time and interest rates stabilize. At the same time, we've been very
much focused on integrating our BMO EMEA business and that's going well. We continue to make good
investments in the business overall, ensuring that we have the right focus to move forward in distribution, as well
as servicing and platform capabilities, but we also have a very strong eye towards managing expenses in this
market. And adjusted for the BMO EMEA acquisition, we brought G&A expenses down by 7%. And we'll continue
to be very focused there.
As I look ahead for Ameriprise, I believe we will continue to be operating in these markets for a while. So as you
expect from us, we're very much focused on what we can control. That includes continuing our strong
engagement with clients and advisors, as well as leveraging our investments as we continue to manage our
expenses tightly moving forward.
Importantly, I feel like the strength of our businesses and the growth of the bank will allow us to navigate these
markets very well and generate a consistent level of free cash flow and good returns for our shareholders. And
what's very important and critical for the firm and what we deliver is the engagement of our people and advisors. I
feel very good about the team.
We just conducted our employee and advisor surveys. And we continue to see high levels of engagement and
satisfaction, industry-leading. And we know how important this is, going through a challenging environment, to
keep our focus on our clients.
In total, I feel really good about the mix of our business, the flexibility we have and how we're positioned for both
the challenges and the opportunities ahead.
Now, I'll turn it over to Walter, and then I'll take your questions.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Thank you. As Jim said, results this quarter continue to demonstrate the strength of the Ameriprise value
proposition, as adjusted EPS, excluding unlocking, increased 9% to $6.43 in a challenging market environment.
Both management business momentum, higher interest rate environment and expense discipline more than offset
equity and fixed income market depreciation, coupled with significant weakening of the pound and the euro in the
quarter.
We continue to benefit from strong growth in Wealth Management, which represented 60% of adjusted operating
earnings in the quarter, up from 49% a year ago. Across the firm, we continue to manage expenses tightly,
relative to the revenue opportunity within each segment.
As a result, we've continued to make investments in the bank and other growth initiatives, particularly in Wealth
Management, while prudently managing overall firm-wide expenses. On a year-to-date basis, G&A expenses are
flat, excluding BMO. We expect that for the year, G&A will be down 1%.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
Our balance sheet fundamentals remained strong, despite continued market depreciation in the quarter, and we
returned $632 million of capital to shareholders. For the full year, we remain on track to return approximately 90%
of adjusted operating earnings to shareholders.
Let's turn to slide 6. Assets under management and administration ended the quarter at $1.1 trillion, down 9%.
While AUM/A benefited from strong client flows and the addition of BMO late last year, we experienced significant
market impacts. Equity and fixed markets were down 19% and 14%, respectively. In addition, Asset Management
AUM levels were substantially impacted by significant weakening of the pound and the euro, with the AUM of non-
US businesses down to approximately 35% of the total.
Overall pre-tax earnings remained strong in this environment, up 6% from last year, excluding unlocking, with
meaningful benefits from interest rates and strong client flows more than offsetting significant negative equity and
fixed income markets and foreign exchange impacts, that largely occurred in September.
Let's turn to individual segment performance, beginning with Wealth Management on slide 7. Wealth
Management client assets declined 12% to $711 billion as a result of significant market depreciation over the past
year, partially offset by our strong organic growth. Total client net flows remained strong at $11.2 billion, up 11%
from last year, with $6.4 billion of flows into wrap accounts and $4.8 billion into non-advisory accounts, specifically
certificates and retail brokerage, as anticipated in this environment. Revenue per advisor reached $819,000 in the
quarter, up 7% from the prior year. [ph] The firm continued to enhance (15:48) productivity and business growth.
On slide 8, you can see Wealth Management profitability increased 30% in the quarter, with the significant benefit
from interest rates and strong organic growth exceeding negative impacts from market depreciation and lower
transactional activity.
Pre-tax operating margin reached nearly 28%, up over 500 basis points year-over-year and up 390 basis points
sequentially. Adjusted operating expense declined 3%, with distribution expenses down 7%, reflecting lower
transactional activity and asset balances.
G&A is up 12% in the quarter, and up 7% on a year-to-date basis. The higher-than-normal year-over-year
increase in the third quarter was driven by unusually low prior-year expenses relating to staffing levels and T&E,
timing of expenses in the current year and continued expenses associated with higher volumes and continued
investments in the bank and other growth initiatives.
We anticipate that the full year will be in line with the 7% year-to-date growth pace. We expect the higher interest
rate pattern to drive a substantial and sustainable benefit in the fourth quarter of 2022 as well as 2023.
Let's discuss the components in more detail. First, cash balances remain high at $46 billion this quarter, with
multiple products available to meet client needs, including brokerage cash, bank and certificates.
The majority of our brokerage cash is in working cash accounts for our clients, where over half of the balances
less than $100,000. And our client crediting rates are continuously benchmarked and remain competitive. As a
result, we have not experienced cash sorting issues to the extent of others in the industry.
Our certificated products offer another solution for clients looking to ladder their liquidity and garner some
additional rate upside in the multiple product offerings. Second, the bank provides flexibility to optimize the
benefits from higher rates by investing in high-quality, longer duration securities, creating sustainability of interest
earnings.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
Our bank reached nearly $19 billion in the quarter, up from $10 billion a year ago. In 2023, we plan to grow the
bank to the $22 billion range. In the quarter, the pickup from investments in the bank is approximately 150, 200
basis points above the spreads from off-balance sheet cash.
Over the past several years, our total client cash balances have been consistently 5% to 6% of total client assets.
This positions us well to capture the opportunity from rising rates and lock in those benefits over the medium-
term. In 2022, spread earnings will increase by over $600 million versus the prior year, and we expect this trend
to continue into 2023.
Let's turn to Asset Management on slide 9. We are managing the business well through a challenging market.
Total assets under management declined 6% to $546 billion, primarily from equity and fixed income market
depreciation, and unexpected significant negative pound and euro foreign exchange impact.
As I mentioned, the BMO acquisition broadened our geographic diversification with about 35% of the assets in
EMEA. However, this diversification increased our foreign exchange translation exposure.
Asset Management, like the industry, was in outflows in the quarter. Continued strength in our Global Institutional
business offset a meaningful portion of retail outflows. Like others, we experienced pressures from global market
volatility, a risk off investor sentiment and geopolitical strain in EMEA.
Margin in the quarter declined to 35.6%, which is slightly above our target range of 31% to 35%. Decline versus
last year is attributable to broad market depreciation and foreign exchange impacts. Given the material market
depreciation and foreign currency weakening in September, we expect additional margin erosion next quarter.
On slide 10, you can see Asset Management financial results reflect the market environment. Earnings declined
to $191 million, reflecting double-digit market depreciation, significant foreign exchange weakening and outflows.
Importantly, we continue to manage the areas we can control. Expenses remain well mannered. Excluding BMO,
total expenses were down 13%, aided by a 7% decline in G&A. We continue to make market-driven trade-offs in
discretionary spend and remain committed to managing expenses very tightly in the current revenue environment.
And the fee rate remained stable in the quarter at 48 basis points.
Let's turn to slide 11. Retirement & Protection Solutions continued to deliver stable earnings and free cash flow
generation, a clear result of our differentiated risk profile. Pre-tax adjusted operating earnings, excluding
unlocking, were $203 million.
In the quarter, we completed our annual actuarial assumption update, which resulted in an unfavorable pre-tax
impact of $172 million. Sales in the quarter, similar to the industry, declined as a result of the volatile market
environment, as well as management action to discontinue sales of variable annuities with living benefits to
reduce the risk profile of the business.
Protection sales remain concentrated in higher-margin asset accumulation VUL, which now represents one-third
of total insurance inforce assets. Annuity sales in the quarter were in lower risk products without guarantees and
structured variable annuities. These products represent over 40% of our total VA account value.
We have begun to reposition our investment portfolio to capture the interest rate opportunity. We have remained
short on duration in this portfolio, given the low rate environment over the past several years. We now have the
8

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
opportunity to enhance yield by extending asset duration and changing the mix of investments without increasing
credit risk.
Now, let's move to the balance sheet on slide 12. Our balance sheet fundamentals remain strong, and our
diversified high-quality investment portfolio remains well positioned. In total, the average credit rating of the
portfolio is AA, with only 1.6% of the portfolio in below investment-grade securities.
Despite significant market dislocation in the quarter, VA hedge effectiveness remained very strong in the quarter
at 97%. Our diversified business model benefits from significant and stable free cash flow contributions from all
business segments. This supports the consistent and differentiated level of capital return to shareholders, even
during periods of market depreciation like we experienced this quarter.
During the quarter, we returned $632 million to shareholders and excess capital and holding company liquidity
remains strong. We are on track to return approximately 90% of the adjusted operating earnings to shareholders
in 2022.
With that, we'll take your questions.

first question from Ryan Krueger with KBW.

Ryan Krueger Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is could you give an update on your excess capital position and any
moving parts on the quarter?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Sure. I'll take that. The number is $1.3 billion. It's down $300 million from last quarter. And the main drivers on
that is the market dislocation and the growth in the bank and the remainder is coming from the unlocking.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ryan Krueger Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Got it. Thank you. And then, separately, in Retirement & Protection, the earnings are over $200 million this
quarter, ex unlocking. They had previously been running more in the $180 million to $190 million range. Can you
help us think about the run rate earnings in that business going forward and also how that portfolio repositioning
will impact that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. I would say that, yes, it did increase a little, but I think the run rate that you're talking about between the
$180 million range is certainly one that we anticipate going forward. And yes, the interest rates, we'll take that up
again as we do it because we are reinvesting out as we looked at the portfolio and the opportunities because we

basically say shorter duration. Now we're taking advantage as we move out. But it will go up, but I would say, I
would start with the $180 million range.

Operator: We'll take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS Financial.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Good morning, Jim and Walter. Thanks for taking my queston. I'd love to start with some of the comments on the
bank. I believe you indicated that you'd be moving about $3 billion in balances in 2023. Why not accelerate that?
We saw more than that move in 2022. The rate environment is certainly attractive, and it seems like a good place
to utilize some of that capital. So that's number one. And then number two, when you think about the pledge loan
book within the bank, are you seeing any change in demand or growth as a result of higher rates, where maybe
the demand has eased up a bit?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So as it relates to 2023, I indicated that the – it probably was better to say it was at least [ph] $2 billion – we would
add (26:02) $3 billion next year, which, obviously, we'll gauge the situation. We certainly have the capacity to do
more, both from the availability of liabilities and capital. And we will assess it. And the key element associated
with that is also the availability of investments that meet our standards, both from a quality standpoint and
diversification standpoint. That won't be a factor in that. We feel very comfortable with the balances we have, that
will be the source of that. So I would probably modify and say at least $3 billion.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Okay, thanks for that clarification. And then, pledge loans, have you seen any shift in demand with higher rates or
have those continued to grow?

Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
In pledge loans, it's actually – right now, it's adjusting its markets, but it's growing steadily, and we feel very
comfortable with it. And from that standpoint, total of that is over the $1 billion range, the total standpoint with our
program. So we feel very comfortable with it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Brennan Hawken Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Great, thanks for that. And then, in the Wealth business, you guys do a great job of returning capital to
shareholders and have a long track record there, and I think it's appreciated. But have you considered maybe
shifting and having an allocation to growth capital and using some of your excess capital to actually continue to
build on the recent success that you've had in adding advisors and generating that really steady net new assets in
the mid-single digits and maybe even pushing that a little higher? Have you considered any of that or is that
you're just sort of comfortable with the recruiting approach that you've taken so far?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So we're very much focused on continuing to bring in quality recruits. We just don't want to associate
people to us and have – be in a processing platform per se. As you can see, we have a very good, strong client
value proposition that's very important. That's why we generate good returns, good margins, good retention of
assets. We ensure that we have an excellent client experience, keeping our client satisfaction really high. And we
really focus on helping good quality advisors grow their practices and retain and build.
So we're going to continue to look and attract good advisors in. We're spending a bit more time on bringing in
some younger people again and building succession in their practices and helping advisors extend their teams.
And we're also building out our IPI group, which is our institutional business, and we're winning some nice
accounts there and growing the advisor for us.
And we're also doing some work on our remote channels and expanding that activity that we think will also be a
complement. So along those lines, we are putting money to work. We are investing, et cetera. So it's not so much
about the use of capital. It's more about continuing to drive in the areas that we think we can generate both good
returns, but, more importantly, continue to build out against our value proposition.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
Great. Thanks. Just wanted to go back to the bank, if I could. I guess in addition to adding more deposits, we're
thinking another lever you guys have is to reinvest some assets that are maturing, that the deposits are currently
supporting. So can you frame maybe how much of those assets are rolling off in 2023? And if possible, what the
yield was on those assets relative to where you're able to invest new money today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah, so let me take an approximate. It's Walter. Approximate, because we're a short duration, if you look at
where duration is, it's a tad over three, that you should expect over $3 billion to mature in the year. And I don't
have the exact numbers on yield, but you should imagine that it's – we're going to pick up at least 300 or 400
basis points versus what's maturing. But I can have Alicia get back to you on that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Suneet Kamath Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then, I guess, for Jim, towards – as the quarter progressed, we were getting
quite a few questions on LDI in the UK and what's going on there and what any impact on your UK Asset
Management business there could be. So could you maybe frame that out, how you're thinking about that as an
opportunity or where the risks are? Just want to make sure that it's clear in terms of where your exposure is, if
possible. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Sure, Suneet. So I think as everyone is aware, this is a very large market. It's over to $1.3 trillion in the UK,
depends on the day. And it's really used by – almost all the pension funds there are supported by the regulatory
authorities. The long-term [ph] yield (31:13) in European interest rates, you know, increased dramatically in
September, and that resulted in clients having to post additional collateral to maintain their LDI coverage ratios.
The volatility was something that wasn't necessarily seen in the past. It was in the 15 to 18 standard deviation
type event, which is really abnormal. And so that volatility affecting the bond markets, interest rates going up, et
cetera.
So, clients have maintained their LDI positions, as you would expect. The systems – and we think this will
normalize over time, but they had to post more collateral and then free up some assets to do it. This market will
come back around in a sense of the stabilization and the reverting back to the mean.
So, we feel like the market will continue to be very important there. And the pension funds will continue to utilize
that for the way they have to manage their assets going forward to get the returns. But we do expect some
adjustments in the market going forward. Some players would have to reduce leverage a bit. There may be some
more operational adjustments to make sure that the markets can flow a bit more easily as you get these type of
dislocations.
And with us, you, of course, saw an asset level decline, meaning from the depreciation of the market, but we
really haven't seen major outflows in any fashion. And in fact, there's some new business that came in. So, we
feel like this market will recover and we feel like we can still do a good business there, and it won't have a
significant long-term effect.

So, just to summarize, near term, more of a kind of AUM potentially earnings issue as opposed to anything more
significant than that?

Operator: We'll take our next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Great. Good morning. Thank you for the question. First, just around some of the cash dynamics at Advice – over
in Advice & Wealth and kind of how that's trending. So, clearly, great to see deposit betas still very low at this
point in the cycle. As you look forward, I guess, how do you think that will progress? And part B to that, curious if
you're seeing any incremental demand from third-party bank sweep, and whether the spread is starting to improve
in that channel as well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So as far as third-party demand, certainly, we have an extensive program and we do not have an issue on the
placement of the funds, from that standpoint. And we also, again and again, the bank allows us the capability, as I
talked about, growing and certainly reinvesting more directly with a bank institution.
As far as the deposit betas, look, we do a competitive scan each week. We certainly evaluate it certainly as rates
go up and we look at the competitive elements. As you look at the per account compensation or a client crediting
rate, they will change. And I'm sure they will be going up as it relates – because we – our main focus is to ensure
that our clients are getting appropriate rates that are competitive.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. And, Walter, just to make sure that I understood, the – are you saying you're seeing an improvement in
demand from third-party bank sweep or no real change in terms of what we've seen over [ph] the last couple
months (34:46)?

Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
I would say this is a healthy environment, but it's a healthier environment than certainly we saw back a couple of
months ago, from that standpoint, absolutely.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q
Analyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
Got it. Understood. And then, Jim, one for you. There's been a couple of articles talking about some potential
asset management platforms for sale. In the past, you guys have obviously been very opportunistic when I kind of
think about the Columbia acquisition from Bank of America. As the environment gets potentially – or remains, I
guess, kind of dicey here, how do you think about opportunities for incremental M&A for Ameriprise on the asset
management side of the house?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So, again, I think the market is going through a level of dislocation right now and some pressure from, as you can
see, depreciation of the market and flows. We are very much focused on really the business that we have right
now. We're integrating the BMO in international, and that's going well. And that's consuming some time and
attention.
At the same time, we know that this is a time for us to really engage our clients and maintain it, and we have a lot
of good new stuff going on in some of the areas and disciplines that we've been investing in, from ESG to some of
the institutional and OCIO and et cetera, et cetera, and some alternatives. So, we feel good about the hand. We
don't know that down the road, if there's more significant dislocation and it makes some sense, maybe we'll play.
But right now, it's not something we have on the plate.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alexander Blostein Q

Operator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Kligerman Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Hey, good morning. Maybe staying on the topic of M&A, but on the divestiture end. The market's been pretty
volatile. And just in general, block transactions of insurance assets have not been as robust as we would have
thought. And I had some optimism that maybe Ameriprise would do some transactions. Could you give a little
color on the types of talks you're having about long-term care, variable annuities and life insurance blocks,
respectively, and the potential to divest?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Sure, Andrew. So as you – as we said, we wanted to survey the markets, see potential and what the opportunity
may be just to evaluate. And in so doing, what we found most importantly is that there aren't a lot of market
participants that have transacted are interested in more, what I would call high-quality books, in a sense. They've
been much more focused on general count assets, so that they can invest with using their various structures and
14

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
capital situations. So, we don't think the market has sufficiently evolved to look at the type of business that we
have and the type of value that we realize from that business.
And so at this juncture, we actually feel very good about holding business. We actually derisk the business
tremendously. We moved out of a lot of types of businesses that have a bit more of that both volatility or long-term
tail. Our mix of business, including our variable annuities, without living benefits, is a significant part of our
portfolio. The other portfolio with the living benefits that's closed at this point was actually done in the right way,
with the right benefits and the right hedging. And so we get good cash flow from these businesses and good
stability. I think you even saw in the current quarter, this has been a nice stability for us as you get depreciating
markets on the equity side. And now Walter's able to even invest out longer and get higher yields on the book,
which is good.
In our long-term care book, you can see the quality of that, even over the current years and a number of years.
And so here again, there might be some opportunities as people start to get more informed on this over time that
we'll see, and I think we're starting to. But I think at this juncture, we're very comfortable with the hand we have,
what we're doing, the type of businesses we maintain and type of businesses we invest in and the type of
businesses that we move and handle the book to manage. And so we actually think it's a great complement,
particularly in an environment like this.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Andrew Kligerman Q
Analyst, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
That's really helpful. And, Jim, maybe just shifting over to asset management. Per the presentations, clearly, in
retail, the three, five and 10-year numbers are excellent versus peers. But the one-year numbers seem to have
deteriorated in both retail equity and retail fixed income. Could you kind of give a little color on why those figures
have deteriorated versus peers and strategically what you might do to turn around that performance?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So again, good question. And I think we mentioned at a little higher level, so let me dig a little deeper for you. So
overall, and across our portfolios, even for the one year, they're very good. There are a few pockets that – where
we have some underperformance, but it's not by a lot that really brings the averages down. So some of that's in
our fixed income.
So in some of the longer duration, because of the rise, the spike in interest rates as quickly, our teams were much
more focused on the credit side. And so the duration was a bit longer and so that impact. Now, that will come and
reverse around as we get further out, where the yield will be good, et cetera. But I would probably say that's
where we've gotten some of the impact, not on the shorter duration, on the longer.
And then, the second part is in Europe. And it's not because of underperformance. It's because in Europe, when
they have equities, they don't break their benchmark into value versus growth, et cetera. And so we have more
growth quality-oriented portfolios. And as you would understand, value has performed a bit better in this market.
Even though it's down, it's been down less than growth-oriented. And so those, as benchmarks, underperformed
the benchmark. But our clients there understand that. That's why they invested in the portfolios and they know
and feel good about what that is over the longer term. But on a benchmark basis, that's why you got the
underperformance.

Operator: We'll take our next question from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig Siegenthaler Q
Analyst, Bank of America
Thanks. Good morning, everyone. My question is on brokerage cash sorting. How do you expect sorting activity
to trend over the next six to 12 months? And what do you see as the direct impact to both money market fund
AUM and cash balances?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So let me start and if Walter wants to complement. So we already have an in – what you've seen in the growth of
our cash, there's already had the cash, cash sorting occurring. So the growth of cash itself, if you call it in a larger
category, is higher than our $46 billion, because money has gone into money markets and they have gone into
shorter duration funds and some brokered activities.
And so with the growth that we have, this is more of the continuation of the growth that's more in the transactional
held for cash or in our certificate programs. And so we saw some of that cash sorting occur in the third quarter, as
you said. We may see some more of it, but ties of the cash has grown because people have moved money to the
sidelines.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
The only thing I would add there is I think, as I think Alicia said yesterday, over 50% of this transitional working
cash is less than $100,000 or $100,000 and less. So its stickiness is there and certainly we are competitive in
what we do. So I think the sorting is less of an issue for us, from that standpoint. Because in the higher tiers, we
are competitive. And we constantly evaluate, like I said, weekly, to ensure that that stays. So it's a different model
that we have, and I think it's demonstrating its stickiness.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Craig Siegenthaler Q
Analyst, Bank of America
Thank you, Walter. Then, sticking with brokerage cash. What are your longer-term targets for both off balance
sheet cash and then on balance sheet cash inside of the bank? And I'm thinking when you reach more of an
equilibrium and your cash mix is post the bulk transfer effort.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So let me take a shot. Listen, obviously, we have a growing situation, certainly with getting additional cash from
our current clients and new areas coming in. So we think – we see that as growing, from that standpoint. And we
will gauge it as obviously the impact of looking at alternatives because it is, again, transitional on where it's going
to go. But that is something from a directional standpoint very sticky, and we do see certainly potential to grow.

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
But we will then look for, as I indicated, the ability to redeploy in our multiple strategies to ensure the stability of
our earnings that we have, both in garnering the higher yield with the – certainly the high – the low-risk profile that
we do and to ensure that. So I would say that you'll see the percentage going over the bank increasing as we
progress, as we feel confident. But it's all situationally driven. And that's why I said when I said in my talk points,
$3 billion is probably at least $3 billion because we do see, in this case, but we reevaluate that. There's a
substantial opportunity to use the bank, not just for the investments we're talking about, to grow the capabilities
that we have to meet our clients' needs, also with deposit products and other products that they're developing at
this stage.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah, we'll be launching a number of deposit products in the bank starting in the first quarter and then high-
yielding type of deposits and other things that you see in some of the other types of institutions later in the year.
So we feel there's an opportunity to not just transfer money in, but to actually grow the deposit base.

Operator: Take our next question from Kenneth Lee with RBC Capital Markets.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth Lee Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions and good morning. Just one on the Asset Management business. In terms of
the margins, obviously above the target range this past quarter. Wondering if there's any specific factors driving
that, any potential benefits that are non-recurring. And in terms of the outlook for margins, you mentioned
potential erosion based on FX. Just wondering if you could just further expand that. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So on the margins, as you saw, certainly as it relates to the markets that we looked at last year, they're running
there in the 40s, and we mentioned that we're certainly getting the benefits from the market appreciation that was
taking place. And now, you're seeing, from that standpoint, we've already absorbed the lower margin, as we
indicated, to that associated with the BMO business, which is the nature of the business. So this 35.6% range is
above, slightly above, our target of 31% to 35%. That's been impacted by the markets, primarily. There's no
abnormalities that we see, other than the foreign exchange and the other things that have impacted that.
But as I'll mention, the market – basically depreciation substantially took place in the September timeframe. So
you will see a carryover of that into the fourth quarter, but that will be a market-driven situation. We'll probably
move it to the lower end of the range.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
And foreign exchange, we have 40% of our assets, as you know, a year ago with the BMO acquisition in Europe
and the UK. And you can see the size of that depreciation of the pound and the euro, and that had a sizable
effect. Now, hopefully, that will stabilize in over time. Because the dollar's so strong, maybe start to come back in
17

a fashion that would be a positive. But the combination of that and depreciating markets have really squeezed
that a bit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Kenneth Lee Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Got you. Very helpful. And just one follow-up, if I may, just on the annual actuarial review. Wondering if you could
just share with us some of the key assumption changes driving most of the impact. Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Well, okay. The key elements that drove it from the actuarial element was that we adjusted our mortality tables.
And from the standpoint of we look at our experience and so that was one. And then, we also saw lower lapses
coming in, and therefore, extending our living benefits [ph] going those that are primary. All (47:44), again, nothing
out of pattern. It was just – that was the trendline.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
And we did not adjust our interest rates where we had lowered them a year ago. And you can see the rise in
interest rates.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A

Operator: We'll take our next question from Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Good morning. First question is just how do you think about the ROI difference right now between the build in
bank versus the benefit of share repurchase? Thinking about how much you've grown the size of that bank and
the capital that's been used to build that up. I assume those are pretty high ROEs. But just curious if you can give
some perspective on what level ROE, ROI, however you want to describe it and how that would compare to the
return you get from share repurchase.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Well, it's interesting because, listen, I think as you look at the amount of free cash flow we generate and the
amount of excess capital we have and our ability to – does not inhibit in any manner, shape or form our ability to
continue to grow and invest in our bank, to garner the benefits of both. And we constantly are making that
evaluation, assessing our excess as it is the situation and the generation that we have. So I would say the return
to the bank are certainly getting to very respectful levels.
18


Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
(AMP) Corrected Transcript
Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
And the buyback from that standpoint is an element that we look at certainly our excess, looking at the opportunity
to return to shareholders and then other opportunities. But one of the things that we constantly do is the ability –
we are not basically [ph] stopping (49:30) or reducing our impact of investing in the business. And that is a key to
us. So I would say they're not mutually exclusive. We kind of...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
No. And I think you'll also find that the bank now will become a nice complement. And it's not just for what it is
today, but strategically, it will actually help us expand our relationships, deepen them with clients, offer a lot of
other products that's situational for the Wealth business. And so we actually think it's a great diversifier and a
great complement. And that capital that we're deploying, we'll get a very good return on it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. Thanks. And then, just to follow-up on the whole cash benefit that you would still expect to see heading into
2023. I just want to make sure I'm thinking about this correctly or at least directionally correctly. If I add – look at
the $46 billion all-in of balances and listen to everything you've said so far, on the revenue side, I can – and I'm
going to compare it to the run rate you had in 3Q to then where they should go to in 2023.
But on the revenue side, I can get somewhere in the $300 million to $400 million pre-tax earnings revenue pickup
headed into 2023. But then, it's a little less clear to me how much of a give up you would expect to have on cost of
crediting, whether that's 20%, 50%. And any – so, Walter, curious if you can give me some idea whether I'm in the
right directional place on the revenue pickup and then also on credit...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
I'm not going to get into the forecasting, Tom. I'm not going to get into the forecast. I will say, as you see what the
trendlines are and certainly the elements of potential rate increases and the balances we have, but there's a lot of
variables that go into it.
But certainly, we have a very, very strong trendline as we certainly go into the fourth quarter and going into 2023.
And we feel with the complement of both the short cash coming out of the sweep accounts and the investments
there and the spreads that we're picking up in the bank, you can imagine it is going to be a positive trend as we
move into the fourth and first – in 2023.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Thomas Gallagher Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Okay. And, Walter, sorry, just a follow up on that. Anything you can offer, it doesn't look like you've had to give
much up on cost of crediting so far. Any sense for how that might change? Do you think that's still going to be a
fairly low impact or do you think that that might move up materially?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
I would say this. What we're saying is there is an increase in crediting rates and there will be, as rates continue to
be persistent or go up. We will make adjustments. Again, based on size of account and whether it's really a
transactional or not and keeping the cash.
19

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
But, as Walter said, some of that could be – will be offset based on some of the rollover in assets we have in the
bank and how to invest as well as what we transfer. But also there's a question. Is the Fed going to continue to
raise rates? I mean, it's pretty much, we think, is going to go up again.
I know there's a lot of things that the Fed is going to pull back next year. But with inflation so persistent, I'm not
sure that's the case. And if it is, we have the ability to invest out. So I think we're feeling very good that what we
get from the bank, what we get from the overall business will offset the appreciating markets and give us a nice
complement here.

Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Hey. Good morning. So wanted to start off with a question just on the organic growth drivers in AWM, the 6%
organic growth, certainly a good result, given the [ph] choppy tape (53:30).
It looks like you recorded some wins in the financial institutions channel during the quarter. How material were
some of those wins from an M&A perspective? And could you help frame the organic growth opportunity that you
envisage within that channel?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
Yeah. So we are getting some nice wins. And we actually have a good pipeline of even some larger-size types of
deals, arrangements. Excuse me. And as those deals occur, the assets usually follow. So in that sense, you have
that pipeline that occurs and then you bring on the advisors, et cetera, to help grow those channels.
So we feel it will be a nice growth business for us. Again, based on the size and scale compared to our other
businesses, it's not of the scale yet, but we think this will grow in scale over time. And so we feel very good about
it. We don't break out information yet. That'll be something we'll look at down the road.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Steven Chubak Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Got it. And just a follow-up on the earlier discussion relating to cash sorting. You noted that you've seen some
better cash sorting trends relative to peers. Some of your peers also alluded to a benefit from heavy selling
activity in September.
I was hoping you can just give an update on what you're seeing in terms of cash balance trends or levels in
October. And maybe a little bit more specificity just in terms of where you expect cash balances to settle out once
we reach, whether it's terminal Fed funds or just peak sorting activity across the complex?

Q3 2022 Earnings Call 26-Oct-2022
The only thing, I mean, the way I would position it to you is we've always had a certain level that is held in our
cash, based on how we do asset allocation, how we have it for clients' liquidity needs, an emergency, or even for
cash to reinvest in and balances that ability to allocate. And so, if you assume that's the case, 5%, 6%, you can
look at it that way.
Of course, cash has built up a bit more, and we saw that. And that's why I said there's a complement to cash
above what we're holding that have gone into some of these other types of money markets and other things and
brokerage CDs, et cetera, et cetera, so unstructured. So, I would probably say we are not seeing that there would
be a dramatic fall-off in the cash that we're holding. There may be some adjustment because it's gone up a bit.
But we feel very comfortable that within that type of range of percentage to assets, because, again, this is not
where people are holding huge amounts of cash just short term. They usually – our advisors usually invest at one
level anyway, even if it's in a type of cash product or a bond. I think over time, fixed income will come back. That
bodes well for our Asset Management business as well and go to work in our wrap accounts. But I still think that
that 5% or 6% would be rational as the clients as we've seen over the past.

For 2023, that's where I would say, the bulk of these synergies will be achieved as we go. And we'll also then
complete most of our transition expense activities as related to it. And so, we're on track and we're performing
well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
And most of what you saw in the reduction in expenses wasn't necessarily from synergies yet in the current
periods. So, that's more of tightening up our expenses as we go in, and the team is doing a good job of
rationalizing what that is. And we'll look to maintain control of those expenses. We are still making nice
investments in Asset Management. But I think the synergies will be helpful as well as we go in, that will offset
some of the compression that we're seeing in the European markets.

Thank you. And then my follow-up question, [ph] do you feel mortality (58:20) is the best, strongest or healthiest in
3Qs annually? Did that pre-COVID cadence to mortality trends return for the Retirement & Protection Solutions
life business? Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
So if you're talking the mortality table that we addressed it in the second?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Barnidge Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
No, I'm just talking [indiscernible] (58:40).
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
The mortality in our normal life business? Again, mortality in the life, is we're using basically industry tables right
now, and we are basically seeing that our trends are totally consistent with the industry tables that we've been –
that are out there.

Erik Bass Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Hi. Thank you. Maybe for Wealth Management, just trying to put it all together. It doesn't sound like there's
anything unusual that benefited margins this quarter and you'll still expect to see some benefits from interest rates
going forward. So do you see a margin in the 27% range as sustainable near term and something that could
potentially even move higher if markets stabilize?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Walter S. Berman A
Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
I would say, listen, our margin in the base business are increasing. But really, we are getting the lift from the
interest rates, and that is an important contributor. And certainly, we do see margins from those activities being
larger elements as you look at the bank and you look at the [ph] sweep cash (59:46). So yes, the answer is yes.
We do see the margins will be increasing based upon the current assumptions that we see.

Erik Bass Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Thank you. And then, I guess last thing, just on the new advisor recruiting outlook. Can you just talk about how
market conditions are affecting your ability to recruit advisors? Because it was a good quarter this quarter, but I
know things sort of happen on a lag. So are you seeing any change in the pipeline?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
James M. Cracchiolo A
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Ameriprise Financial, Inc.
No. We see a good pipeline. We are maintaining sort of our focus on that and the areas of levels that you've been
seeing. I think we are finally breaking through as far as what advisors understand about our business. I mean,
when we compare what we do, our capabilities, our technology, et cetera, I think advisors are very impressed and
we get very good compliments. I mean, nine times out of 10 our advisors join us say that our capabilities,
technology support is way beneficial from the firms that they joined us from, whether they be the independents or
[ph] the wires (01:00:53), et cetera. So we feel very good about what that is as long as we have the
conversations.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erik Bass Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Perfect. Thank you.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Operator: And that does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation and you may now
disconnect.
