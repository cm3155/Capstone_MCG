Q1 2020 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2020
Thank you. Welcome everybody to our first quarter earnings call. Hope you are all isolated and well. With me
obviously Dave Dykstra; Tim Crane, our new Wintrust President; Rich Murphy, Vice Chair and Senior Lending
Officer; Kate Boege, our General Counsel; and Dave Stoehr, our Chief Financial Officer. Kate Boege is very
worried because we're all in different places and her shock collar doesn't come that far on me. So, Kate, I will
behave. I promise.
As you can see we do have additional Wintrust execs on the call. I think it's important to get to know them better
and I think there will be a lot of questions arising just because of the times and what's going on. So I thought
better to have more reinforcements around. The format will be for the most part as usual, however we're going to
try not to parrot what's already in the release to leave more time for the questions as I said – as I'm sure you'll
have a number of them.
I'm going to give some general comments regarding our results. Dave Dykstra will provide a more detailed
analysis of other income, other expenses and taxes, back to me for a summary, comments and thoughts about
the future. And we'll have time for questions.
Before I get into the details, I would like to do a heartfelt shout out to what I believe is the absolute best crew in
the banking business. Case in point – a couple of cases in point. Our crew has moved seamlessly to remote
locations, also being able to grow the bank and take care of our clients. It's worked extremely well. Our
technology crew has done a wonderful job. Also in seven days we stood up a front-end portal PPP from scratch.
We opened the portal – the only ones opened on the evening of April 3, first day available and it actually worked
flawlessly. Two weeks thereafter, it was all working from remote locations and processed 8,900 applications for
$3.3 billion. That put us in the top 15 of banks in the country in terms of total volume. Median size [indiscernible]
(00:03:27) fees to Wintrust, before round two approximate price of $85 million. Our debts have cleared for round
two. We already have close to 2,000 applications, another $8 million – $9 million in fees in there, the applications
again are in the lower area – in the lower end area. So we know we've taken care of all of our customers across
the board. I couldn't be prouder of the team that's been able to do this. One point in time we had a need for more
quality control people, we had 300 people volunteer. People worked tirelessly all night. One guy, they called
[indiscernible] (00:04:07), other banks branches so quickly, it was unbelievable.
And now on to our first quarter earnings. As you can see, we've made close to $63 million, down 27% from the
fourth quarter, but for obvious reasons, our earnings per share $1.04. If you take our pre-tax pre-provision, pre-
MSR valuation income, it's over $150 million, which is almost a record for us. It's pretty darn good in terms of core
earnings, and that's before really any recognition of the – probably close to $100 million we'll have in PPP income,
which will act as a reserve for us. A cushion for us, we believe, for any eventuality may come along.
Net interest margin held up pretty well, as we were able to drop our deposit costs rapidly. We still have room to go
there as indicated on page 18 of the press release. The 5 basis point margin decrease was due to really a 4 basis
point drop in the free funds ratio, as you'd expect as the overall rate environment goes down and 1 basis point
difference, so 12 basis point drop in earning asset yield, 11 basis point drop in liabilities.
Net interest income was essentially flat, really – one less day was offset by $925 million in average earning asset
growth. We expect the core NIM, that being net interest margin without PPP effect to drop to the levels previously
disclosed in the past [ph] for (00:05:49) future quarters. However, the amortization of PPP, the terms of which are
in question, but no longer than two years and expected to be much shorter we'll have a material positive effect in
both the margin and in the net interest income even in the worst case scenarios.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2020
On to the provision and credit quality, adopted CECL, it's so early, I think is I picked the wrong quarter
[indiscernible] (00:06:13) certainly picked the wrong corner to put CECL in effect. Now we adopted CECL Day 1
adjustment of $47 million, the first quarter provision of $53 million which exceeded the fourth quarter provision by
$45.2 million, our ending reserve was up $95 million from year end to now the $253 million. I'll leave this from
here as I'm sure you're going to have a number of questions. And on the CECL calculations, I'll leave that to our
CECL experts who are here to answer your questions. But net charge-offs [indiscernible] (00:06:45) $5.3 million in
Q1.
Credit quality remained relatively in good shape the same period over period, on apples to apples basis. NPLs
increased due to three factors. First, the pool accounting for acquired loans went away with the adoption of CECL,
adding about $35.5 million to the total. Second, approximately $21 million of new nonaccruals were added to the
normal course of business, largest of these being an SBA loan where we should get good recoveries
[indiscernible] (00:07:18) nonaccrual. Now these assets have been marked appropriately, they will be resolved
relatively quickly.
Finally, commercial premium finance loans over 90 days delinquent [indiscernible] (00:07:27) state imposed
restrictions on canceling policies during the current crisis. As you know, our commercial premium finance portfolio
is regulated individually by all 50 states. In the case of a crisis like we have now many of them preclude you from
canceling policies. However, in the past we have only seen minor tick ups because they will go back and honor
the actual cancellation date. And most states are required to go back and honor that, but – so really the insurance
companies take the hit on that. But we do expect a minor tick up in charge-offs but not as much as you would
imagine. That's always been the case in the past we had hurricanes, fires, 9/11, et cetera.
[indiscernible] (00:08:13) the material effects of the current crisis on our credit quality, our PPP loans coupled with
interest and principal deferrals have been granted to customers – granted to our borrowers and other customers.
Regulators are really cooperating on this and we believe that we should be able to weather the storm, at least buy
time for our borrowers coupled with their highly diversified portfolio and history of loan losses in troubled times vis-
à-vis with peer group. We're cautiously optimistic, but however, at this point it's a tossup as to if and when the
stress will appear in the portfolio. With our expected core earnings augmented by PPP earnings [indiscernible]
(00:08:53) reserves and capital, we feel adequately situated to take on whatever comes our way. Look forward
your questions in this area.
Dave is going to cover other income, other expense in detail but I'd like to – suffice it to say that we had a great
mortgage quarter [indiscernible] (00:09:08) $10.4 million mortgage servicing valuation expense, that might be
jinxed in this but I think they can't go down much more. It had to be close to bottom of our mortgage servicing
rights. And our net overhead ratio was 1.33%, down 20 basis points from fourth quarter of 2019, more than made
up for the drop in the net interest margin.
On the balance sheet front, we grew – total assets grew $2.2 billion. Average earning assets were up $925
million. Our loans were up $1 billion, Rich Murphy will take you through the core of that. But after that was
probably related to – line draws which happened very quickly we've seen abate, at least get the initial fear of –
everybody has been drawing their lines, it's kind of abated a little with the work of the government and other
opportunities. The rest is across the board and we're happy to break it out for a little bit later.
We started the quarter with $870 million of loans where the period end exceeded the average, so we're going to
start with a head start. The second quarter, that does include the PPP loans which as you know we're now with
round two [indiscernible] (00:10:31) we funded about $3.3 billion and we have – we'll have about $3.7 billion up to
$4 billion depending on how quick the window closes in round two.

Deposits grew $1.3 billion in the quarter. We feel very good about our liquidity position right now. We will be able
to take advantage of – we had good liquidity to begin with, they bulked up in anticipation of what was going on,
with our MaxSafe loans where we offer 50 times FDIC coverage because of our 15 charters and other wealth
management opportunities including CDEC which we expect to slow down a little bit, but [indiscernible] (00:11:16)
money at the end of the quarter.
So, we feel very good about where we are. Our loan-to-deposit ratio is 90% and we will obviously go up with PPP
loans, but between our liquidity and our ability to take advantage of the Fed's lines related to PPP, we feel very
good about our liquidity where we stand right now.
So, all in all, we feel comfortable with our balance sheet. Our loan pipelines, believe it or not, remain very strong.
Bit of halo effect coming on because of other banks dropping the ball on PPP, we were able to pick up a number
of prospects and customers and just the word of mouth and spreading that Wintrust came through in our
relationship, [indiscernible] (00:12:07) banking really works. So our pipelines are good. We have to remember the
good loans are made in bad times. So we feel very good about where we are right now. On the balance sheet
side, we think we're well prepared.
I'm going to turn over to Dave, who is going to provide some detail on other income, other expenses and taxes.
Dave?

Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
All right. Thanks, Ed. As normal, I'll just briefly touch on the noninterest income and noninterest expense sections.
In the noninterest income section, our wealth management revenue increased $942,000 to a record $25.9 million
in the first quarter compared to $25.0 million in the fourth quarter of last year, and it's up 8% from the $24 million
recorded in the year ago quarter. Overall, we believe that first quarter was another solid quarter for our wealth
management unit, asset valuation is declining towards the end of the quarter may create some headwinds in the
second quarter, but the trading volume is also fairly solid right now. So we'll see how that comes out in the second
quarter, but the first quarter was a solid quarter for us.
Mortgage banking revenue increased by 1% or $466,000 to $48.3 million in the first quarter from the $47.9 million
recorded in the prior quarter and was up a strong 166% from the $18.2 million recorded in the first quarter of last
year. The company originated approximately $1.2 billion of mortgage loans for sale on the first quarter of 2020.
This compares to a similar $1.2 billion of originations in the prior quarter and $678 million in the first quarter of last
year.
The increase in the revenue from the prior quarter results primarily from $17.4 million of derivative income
associated with the mandatory commitments to fund mortgage originations compared to a $1 million derivative
loss on similar activity in the prior quarter that was offset by a negative MSR adjustment net of the hedging
contract during the first quarter of approximately $10.4 million and that compares to a $1.8 million positive MSR
adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2019. And we also had $5.1 million less of capitalized mortgage servicing
revenue compared to the prior quarter if we had one less sale of our loans during the quarter, so there might be a
little bit of a timing difference there.
The derivative income I talked about really is associated with the surge of the refinancing activity where we had
mandatory commitments to fund approximately $1.4 billion of mortgage loans at March 30 – or March 31 of 2020,
and that's roughly $1 billion more in mandatory commitments to fund than we've averaged over the past four

quarters. So it hasn't really been a big adjustment in the prior quarters because of the amount of loans that we
had mandatory commitments to fund. We're always fairly stable around a few hundred million dollars and it just
jumped up by about a $1 billion. So the positive momentum in the mortgage business and obviously that pipeline
bodes well for closings in the future quarters.
The mix of loan volume originated for sale was – that was related to the refinance activity was approximately 63%
in the first quarter compared to 60% in the prior quarter. So the refinance volume increased slightly during the
quarter and the pipeline is still predominantly filled with refinance applications. We currently expect second
quarter originations to be stronger than the first quarter and that's a result of the continuation of the refinance
activity and the strong pipeline.
Table 15 of our earnings release provides a detailed compilation on the components of the origination volumes
and the production revenue and MSR capitalizations, paydowns, and valuation activity. The company recorded
losses on investment securities of approximately $4.4 million during the first quarter, primarily related to
unrealized losses associated with equity funds that the holding company has investments in, which were initially
used as seed money for proprietary mutual funds. As you all know, equities had big drops at the end of the first
quarter, so those valuations declined.
Other non-interest income totaled $18.2 million in the first quarter, up approximately $4.2 million from the $14
million recorded in the prior quarter. Primary reasons for the higher revenue in this category include $3.9 million of
higher swap fee revenue and $2.1 million of net gains related to sales of certain loans and leases, and this was
offset by a $2.7 million of lower BOLI income as BOLI investments that's supported deferred compensation plans
were negatively impacted by equity market returns. But I should note that the decrease in the BOLI income in the
first quarter resulted in a similar decrease in compensation expense during the quarter, so the net effect of that is
washed out in total.
Turning to the non-interest expense categories, non-interest expense totaled $234.6 million in the first quarter,
down approximately $15 million or 6% from the prior quarter. A number of factors contributed to the decrease.
Salaries and employee benefits expense were down $9.2 million from the prior quarter. Lower levels of
advertising and marketing expenses of $1.7 million compared to the prior quarter. We had $1.4 million less of
OREO expenses, and we had $3.1 million of charges in the fourth quarter of last year that didn't recur related to
the legal settlement charges, contingent purchase price payments and costs, and terminating too small pension
plans. And then, those aforementioned changes I just discussed were offset by $2.8 million of higher FDIC
insurance assessments due to the rebates from FDIC substantially, subsiding in the current quarter compared to
the prior quarter.
I'll talk in more detail about the major categories now. The salaries and employee benefit expense categories I
said declined by $9.2 million from the prior quarter. The majority of the decline in this expense category related to
reduced incentive compensation accruals, which were approximately $8.7 million lower than the prior quarter, with
that change being driven largely by long-term incentive compensation programs, which are forecast to be
negatively affected by the impacts of the current economic conditions brought on by the pandemic situation.
Additionally, salaries expense were down by $1.6 million from the fourth quarter, the primary cause of the decline
was $2.2 million reduction in deferred compensation costs that were related to the BOLI investments that I
previously discussed. And then, offsetting those decreases were employee benefit expenses were up
approximately $1.1 million during the quarter due to higher amounts of payroll taxes which tend to be elevated in
the first quarter of the year.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2020
Data processing expense increased by $804,000 in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. This
was due primarily to approximately $1.4 million of the conversion charges related to the Countryside acquisition
versus only $558,000 of conversion charges related to the STC Capital Bank system conversion that happened in
the prior quarter. The additional operating costs of data processing related to the franchise also contributed to the
increase. For your information, we also expect to incur slightly more than $3 million of additional conversion-
related charges in the second quarter related to the just completed conversion of the Countryside Bank
transaction. And, by the way, our teams did a terrific job of completing that this past weekend, given they were
working in a remote work environment and social distancing requirements, et cetera. So our first virtual
conversion went off well.
FDIC insurance expense, as I mentioned, was up $2.8 million in the first quarter as a result of the assessment
credits substantially going away. We had roughly $200,000 of assessment credits yet in the first quarter of 2020,
but we are essentially done with those, I think we have a little less than $100,000 that could still be credited.
Professional fees decreased to $6.7 million in the first quarter compared to $7.6 million in the prior quarter.
Professional fees, as you know, can fluctuate on a quarterly basis based on the level of legal services for
acquisitions, litigation, problem loan workouts, as well as any consulting services. This category of expenses
came down from the prior quarter due to a decline in legal fees associated with litigation, collections and
acquisitions. The category also experienced a slightly lower level consulting engagement class. And if you look at
the professional fees over the past five quarters, it's averaged $6.8 million, so the $6.7 we incurred this quarter is
relatively in line with our typical amount.
Advertising and marketing expenses in the first quarter decreased by $1.7 million when compared to the prior
quarter, the decline was primarily related to lower mass media advertising costs which tend to be lower in the first
quarter of the year. And we also had some medium – media spending that was associated with various sporting
events that did not occur due to the cancellation of events – cancellation of those events later in the quarter.
OREO expense were actually negative by approximately $876,000 in the first quarter as the company recorded a
gain of $1.3 million on the sale of a piece of OREO property, and that gain was an amount that exceeded the
aggregate costs of OREO expenses and negative valuation charges on other pieces of OREO.
And the miscellaneous expense category totaled $21.3 million in the first quarter compared to $26.7 million in the
fourth quarter of 2019, a decrease of approximately $5.3 million. The decrease was impacted by approximately
$2.7 million of charges in the prior quarter for legal settlement charges, additional expense accrued with
contingent purchase price payments that did not occur in the current quarter. And the current quarter also had a
lower level of travel and entertainment expenses, as you can imagine, and a variety of other smaller fluctuations.
So other than those categories I just discussed, all other categories of non-interest expense were down on an
aggregate basis by $19,000 from the fourth quarter of 2019, and so they were essentially flat. The net overhead
ratio, as Ed mentioned, stood at 1.33% which is down 20 basis points from the 1.53% recorded in the prior
quarter, and the ratio benefited from current balance sheet growth from mortgage banking results and lower non-
interest expenses, and we would expect that net overhead ratio to stay well below the 1.4% in the near-term due
to continuing strong mortgage market, the strong balance sheet growth including the lending related to the PPP
and focus on expense control.
So, with that, I will turn it back over to Ed.

Edward Joseph Wehmer
Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Thank you, Dave. You remind me the guy at the end of our mortgage commercial talks really fast. Anyhow, back
to me for some summary thoughts and thinking about the future. These are really crazy times. I kind of feel like
Bill Murray in Groundhog Day. In fact, my alarm clock, which is Alexa, will play [indiscernible] (00:24:28), plays
Sonny and Cher's I Got You Babe every morning when I get up on purpose.
Quarter and all was really – it was really a pretty good quarter given the current environment. As I said, the
[indiscernible] (00:24:43) quarter is to adapt CECL. I think that we've adapted well to the current environment as
well as it can be. I think our crew is working extremely well. Our ability to service our clients' needs as it relate to
PPP loans, credit modifications, new credit will hopefully have credit issues going forward, at least the financial
effects of those will.
We're not naive enough to think that there will not be a some kind of revocations – the situation. [indiscernible]
(00:25:11) however would say this should affect us less than our peers due to our portfolio diversification and
concerned underwriting culture. So, these losses will be a function of how fast we can get back to work, earnings
from PPP loans will write a wonderful cushion against these unknowns. Time will tell, but we feel pretty darn good
about where we're at.
We said before the crisis that we need to grow through this low rate environment, which is exactly what we're
doing, some of which we didn't anticipate, but our core growth we anticipate to be is very good. We think our
expenses will be in check. Just thinking about travel and entertainment, and no baseball season, and save a lot of
money there. But I – again, I can't say enough about the Wintrust crew and our ability to ride this out and do
[indiscernible] (00:25:58) shareholders, our customers, our employees, and the communities that we serve. And
you can be assured of our best efforts in getting through this crisis and continue to build Wintrust in the solid way,
you know we've always done it.
Then, I'd like to turn over to questions.

Jon Arfstrom Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yes. I wanted to talk about credit, but I guess, first, Dave, he has talked about the revenue line, pre-tax, pre-
provision, and on mortgage, I just wonder I'm trying to understand what you're saying. You have the $17 million
commitment, I guess, gain because of the big pipeline. And I think you're saying that may or may not recur in Q2,
but likely you may not have the MSR headwind as well in Q2. So positive although sustained this kind of revenue
momentum in mortgage. Is that fair?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Well, I think the pipeline is still pretty strong. So, I think, we're still – it looks like we still are building the
pipeline, purchase activity is going to fall off a little bit, but we're going to probably close more loans in the second
quarter, so we'll have production gain there, but that will be offset by probably that derivative going down a little
bit. So I think we're sort of looking at ex-MSRs that sort of being a relatively stable revenue quarter – first quarter
to second quarter.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A

...from the quarter from book to – from lock to closed.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. But we expect – we usually don't have that much visibility going out, but the lock terms have lengthened out
because there's so much volume, so we think we'll still have a fairly decent pipeline on those loans that they have
mandatory commitments, that's the only quarter we'll have to see. But – so I expect that will be down a little bit,
but then the actual gain on sale of higher level of production that we sold will be up a little bit, so probably
offsetting to a greater degree.

Well, I'll give you the 20,000 foot level and Murph can kind of jump in, I'm sure on some of the areas that you want
to cover. It's kind of like time is stopping for two months or three months, I mean, we're giving two or three – we're
given three-month deferrals of principal interest to a lot of clients, regulators are okay with that, taking it on to the
end, it's not – they don't become [indiscernible] (00:29:23) really until after two of those really, six months, that
PPP loans that we've did almost $3.8 billion of those out there to our clients and our clients alike, but still majority
to our clients, [indiscernible] (00:29:37) them two months of – little over two months of breathing room. The
stimulus comes in [indiscernible] (00:29:44) a couple months.
So if you figure it, I don't think you're going to see the stress until – if we can get out of this in two months, the
stress will be mitigated. If we don't get out of it in two months, you're going to have delayed stress that will come
into the portfolio or more fortunate we don't have a lot of credit cards or consumer debt on the books where things
could get a little dicey. But if you think about [indiscernible] (00:30:10) if we have a – we have a mortgage, if we
give a three-month deferral, that guy is okay.
And especially they got a PPP that's gets paid. It's put on the end. No problem. If you think about a commercial
multi-family guy, I need rental payment, okay, I need principal payment. So the whole world is stopping for two or
three months, and I think that any stress that comes through would be a hangover at the end, in the event that we
can't get out, it's going to take six months to get out of where we're at. Then, I think you have issues unless a
government comes in and provides more money into the system. So I think they'll do and say really [indiscernible]
(00:30:49) lot of respects by the shutdown, I think that they're committed to keeping this going. Then, you got to

worry about rates increase. But worry about higher rates down the road and where QE is going to take to all
economy.
Murph, you want to get into some of the specifics on the area parts of the [indiscernible] (00:31:07) consider the
more vulnerable parts of the portfolio by the community?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I would echo Ed's comments to begin with. I think that if we can bounce out of this pretty quickly, we have
programs in place here that have helped our customers and I think they'll respond accordingly. But, obviously, the
longer it takes to get out of this and for customer behavior and the consumer behavior to realty go back to normal,
I think that's the big question that everybody is asking.
One of the examples I use is for – we have a longtime movie theater operator in Chicago that we have a
reasonably sized, not a big loan too, but for him, you just have to question how long will it be before people want
to go back into a movie theater. And that's a good example of where the uncertainty is pretty big.
But as it relates to our high impact industries, we brought – and we gave you a lot of detail there. And obviously
the one that jumps out at you is the franchise portfolio. Generally speaking, we think the franchise portfolio is in
pretty good shape for a couple of reasons. One is that we have mostly quick service restaurants that are 85% of
that portfolio. Most of those are still open. Most of those are too really strong operators with good franchisors. So,
we feel pretty good.
We also have seen a lot of those customers take advantage of some of the deferments and PPP opportunities.
So, generally speaking, those are holding in pretty well. But, clearly, that is a large segment in the portfolio at just
about $1 billion and it's obviously a very impacted industry as well.
As it relates to hospitality, and oil and gas, and some of the other areas that are areas for concern, those are
relatively small for us. We have not typically played in those places all that much. The oil and gas is really a
function of some of the leasing work we've done over the last couple of years. But I would just really go back to
Ed's comments that, right now, the diversity in the portfolio gives us a lot of comfort. We generally pick very strong
operators that we want to finance. But the ripple effects and the length of those ripples, we just don't know right
now, so time will tell.

Yeah, that's what, what I was saying earlier. What you have when have these crises, and again, you're governed
by each state, the regulation. So in Florida, whenever there is a hurricane, you cannot cancel policy. So what
you've got is policies that are – people haven't made their payments or nor going to be canceled, you're not

allowed to cancel. Most of them allow you to go back and cancel them as of that date, the date that it would have
been canceled retroactively, you can't take there – you can't lose, you've got businesses insurance.
So you're going to see those creep up, as I said earlier. You can see a minor tick up in the losses really from
maybe 20 basis points to 23 basis points or something. You can go back and look whenever we've had those
types of issues that this is – not every state's done it, I think maybe 20 states have done it, but insofar in terms of
not allowing cancellations during this period of time. But they always [indiscernible] (00:34:55) get your principal
back maybe add all your interest or late fees, but you get a lot of that back anyhow. So you're going to see those
keep popping up a little bit until the crisis is over, but again, it's not usually a long situation for us.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2020
Yes, indeed. So anyways, I wanted to follow-up on that – on the premium finance business. I know we just talked
a little bit about the – seeing a bit of an uptick there, but the reserve levels in general are always very low for that
business. [indiscernible] (00:36:02) basis points, maybe 20 basis points of reserves. On the commercial side,
maybe just remind us why you can carry such a low reserve in that business, and maybe give us an example of a
situation absent COVID-19, that you may or could lose money in that business?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, our life insurance business [indiscernible] (00:36:22). So – and on the commercial business, I'll let Dave and
Murph take you through that.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. So, Dave, on the commercial business, generally, we're financing commercial insurance policies for
workers comp, building coverage, liability coverage, or whatever it is, and they're generally annual policies. So we
finance those policies by generally taking 1% down. So, 15%, 20% down is sort of a standard down payment
[indiscernible] (00:36:57) over generally 9 months to 10 months, I think our average is just slightly over 9 months.
So if your collateral is the unearned premium held by the insurance carriers which are generally high rated
insurance carriers that we do business with, so if that premium which is your collateral amortizes one 365th or
one 366 in a leap year, per day it amortizes away and earns out, that collateral is deteriorating on a daily basis.
But since you took 10%, 15%, 20% down on that policy, that's your initial cushion; and since we pay that – have
that loan payoff monthly over 9 to 10 months, our loan pays off faster than the collateral deteriorates. So that's
generally why you don't have losses in that industry.
Sometimes you could have losses if you take a lesser down payment and you don't have as much collateral
cushion. And then, if they don't make their payment, the states will require you to generally give them a notice of
time that – to tell them that they've been delayed or defaulted on their loan, and then you can cancel the policy, so
that may be 20 or 30 days depending on the state. And so, then your collateral continues to deteriorate during
that notice period.
So if you cut your collateral position too short, then because you took less down payment, it may eat into your
collateral enough when they default on their payment that you'd have some small losses. And then there are
losses sometimes from auditable policies, workers comp, [indiscernible] (00:38:45), some of those policies are
auditable, and to the extent that the estimated premium in the front-end was off a little bit from what the actual
premium was. So, when they audit the payrolls or the fleet size, then you could have some losses. Those are the
general reasons for it. So – and...

Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
[indiscernible] (00:39:10) fraud or insurance company went bankrupt, in case of a bankruptcy, we monitor the
[indiscernible] (00:39:20) reports and we have credit limits for each insurance company with nine months, we'll
pay out, it usually takes more than nine months for an insurance company to go down. So we can stop doing
business with them and then mitigate it.
You can't have agent fraud, but we've developed the number systems. In the past, we've had some large ones,
relatively large for a time maybe $6 million, $7 million, $8 million. We have not had one in a long time, but we're

doing a much better job electronically of screening for those, but knock on wood we haven't had one of those. So
that's where you could lose money.
Now, what I was saying is, there were some cancellations. They don't allow cancellations you feel your collateral
is going to run off. But the cancellations they're allowing you to backdate. Once we get to it, they always allow you
to back date it when it would have been, the insurance company is the one really kind of loses on that situation.
But it's not so much because claims usually aren't that high. So especially in something like this and in terms of a
hurricane and the like, maybe a little bit different way of higher claims. But that's how it usually happens and
we've averaged around 20 – anywhere between 15 basis points, 25 basis points normally on that and that's
always over that number. And again, life, knock on wood, $7 billion when we lost the dime. So I think we're okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David J. Long Q
Analyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Excellent. I really appreciate the color there, that's helpful. And then, as it relates to the franchise finance side of
things, you indicated that about 85% are quick service. Are there any other of the remaining exposures that you
consider much riskier, anything that you can point there that are at the remaining part of that portfolio?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I mean, the dine-in restaurants is really where I think you're going to be most impacted. For us, that's about
$150 million. All well-known names, but it's just – obviously, they're the most profounding impacted by this.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Many of them have taken the PPP loans from us or from other banks because many of these are syndicated
deals, and they've also gone for deferrals. So, again, this is a situation where a couple months look fine and
hopefully they get out of this, and people, they're going out, eat again, they'll be fine. And when it gets pushed off,
and very logical way to look at it, however it keeps – you don't get back to business until September-October you
can have some issues.

Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. [indiscernible] (00:42:49) just wanted to ask the net interest margin questions, I'm going to ask
one. Just taking a step back as you think about the second quarter, you have the full impact of the March rate
cuts, but then you've got multiple more quarters of just lowering deposit rate. So under that big picture view, Dave,
does that net interest margin bottom out here in the second quarter and then likely potentially move higher in the
second half of the year as deposit prices come down?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, if you're talking about the core net interest margins, yes, it would go down But remember, we're going to
have almost $100 million of PPP fees when we bring it in over two years at the longest. With the shortest, it'll be
people [indiscernible] (00:43:33) go for relief of the funds, these are all – every one of these can be – it is for two
months, it can be two-and-half months, they can apply to the SBA and have them forgiven. They are forgiven, we
take the money upfront.
So in a worst case scenario, for two years, if we – if the whole thing ran out for two years, the margin would be
okay, right around where it is. If it comes in a people at the end of this quarter and beginning of the third quarter,
get those – get their funds for – their loans forgiven, we have $100 million coming in during that period of time. So
that's going to positively affect the margin. So the margin – the core margin is going to end up, like I said, where in
the 2.70% and 2.80% range, somewhere around that based on where we are right now. But the PPP ones are
going to protect us for two years or one year, and some derivative between two months and two years, you tell
me. But they will help the margin and obviously help net interest income to grow nicely.
So between that and our growth, I would expect 2.80% and start bouncing back from there on the core side, but
the PPP loans are going to be very helpful. From the income side to help cushion any long-term credit issues we
have, but also from a margin standpoint. If all I'm saying there, I kind of drifted a little bit.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Terry McEvoy Q
Analyst, Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. Understand your thought process on PPP and how that plays into a margin. Just thinking about the
revenue related to PPP and what that can be to building capital, I know you have the $85 million in this – that you

mentioned in the release, and I just want to make sure that $9 million is just kind of what's in the pipeline. My
guess is you assume that grows and increases on PPP around 2, and then what are the expenses that we should
think about related to PPP, just so we can calculate the bottom line impact that obviously will help your capital
ratios?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
I think the marginal expenses are absolutely zero. We setup the system on our own. And these are people we
had – some people from all over – at home, but will jump in and out them, we didn't add much or any outside
vendor. I don't think there was any issues related to that. Do you think of any, Dave, or Dave Stoehr?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David L. Stoehr A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No. I think it's generally just a people issue with our staff that we already have onboard that to clear up the back
end. You obviously have some minor data process incurred just because you have more accounts part on the FIS
system. But it shouldn't be that much of additional expenses.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

maybe, we'll know better at the end of the day. But – and then, we may open the portal again once we get through
that.
We kind of think that this next round is because many of the banks were not – would drop the ball on this. There
were a number of customers that are waiting [indiscernible] (00:47:31) $26 billion come in, they only funded $14
billion or $12 billion, which means they have $14 billion, they're going hit the [indiscernible] (00:47:39).
We had 98% of ours all the way through the process in round one. [indiscernible] (00:47:48) be fully funded today.
The other guys didn't. So they're going to – this is going to last maybe 48 hours at the most. So [indiscernible]
(00:47:59) next allotment, we will be very careful. We don't overextended it and [indiscernible] (00:48:04). But we
think we can get these through and plus-minus 10%. Whether we get any more on top of it will be a function
where we sit at the end of the day in terms of our production or where we are in our manufacturing process, if you
will.

Hey. Wanted to start this with the CECL reserve. It's a little lower than peers and I understand there are some
mixed benefits from the premium finance book. But can you just maybe talk about kind of the economic
assumptions that are currently underlying the adjustment you made this quarter and any kind of outlook going
forward from here and to 2Q on the need to continue to build this reserve?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, we put in the slide deck what our macroeconomic scenario factors are the ones that are the key drivers for
our models. So it's – some of the credit spreads, commercial real estate price and fees, the GDP growth, et
cetera. So those are the ones that impact our portfolios the most that have the best correlation and then work best
as you look back through the cycles.

So those are the factors that most impacted, but I got to tell you I was reading some of the sell-side analyst
reports last night and I thought I was reading like Goldilocks and the Three Bears. Some people thought I had too
much, some people thought we had too little and some people that we were just right.
So I'm not sure that I – as I look out there, you may have a different view, but it seems like to me, we're more
towards the top of the bell curve and there are some outliers on either side. But as you said, our mix with premium
finance loans I think helps that out quite a bit and I think our diversity helps that out quite a bit. So we think we're
comfortable with where the CECL reserves are at. It's substantially more than what our run rate was. You look at
the total reserve build and, right now, we're comfortable with where it's at. We've gone through all the business
lines, we've done all that heavy lifting. There's more stimulus that's come in that hopefully should help, et cetera.
So, I don't know if you can look into your crystal ball any better than or anybody on this call or us and know how
long this pandemic is going to last and what the lasting effects are. So I'm not even going to take a shot at Q2
reserves. They could be higher, they could be lower, but we'll have to see how quickly the economy reopens and
how quickly things start getting back to normal. But our view is probably is not a V-shape, it's not a complete U-
shape, it's probably someplace in between there.
I've heard like every letter of the alphabet, I'd probably like a D-shape, some goofy shape out there, but –
nobody's talked about. But we're monitoring the portfolio well. We're managing it well and we had a credit team
that put up there with anybody and we'll see where it goes. But I'm not sure we're going to try to make a prediction
on 2Q. I mean, it could be better, it could be worse. As Ed said, it's just what a time for CECL to come in. It is not
transparent I think looking company to company. But if you look at some of the metrics that I've been looking at, it
seems like we're sort of in the middle of the pack and we certainly didn't try to do that, it just seems to be where
we're landing. And I understand people can take a more dark view of where this is going and some people can
take a more favorable view. But we took what we thought was the best reasonable view that we could use in our
modeling and our subject matter experts on the credit side and we think we're okay for now.

Yeah, I mean, CRE is a bit of a wild card. I mean, we've spent some time kind of thinking through what it might
mean. We're pretty well-diversified in the CRE book, multi-family being the largest segment. In multi-family,
generally speaking, it's Chicago metro, it's performed very well, very good long time operators. So I think that that
– I'm feeling pretty comfortable about that. Industrial is a decent size portfolio for us, I feel pretty good about that, I
mean obviously the overall business impact will determine ultimately how that performs.

The areas that get – give me the most concern is retail and office. I think office because I think that this work-
from-home model that we've all adapted is something that we really won't know what it's going to look like a year
from now, two years from now, five years from now, but it's going to be different and how that impacts our
portfolio, it remains to be seen. That being said, again, we tend to be very granular in those deals and we tend to
really pick very strong operators. So again I'm feeling okay there.
Retail is the segment that probably concerns me the most in general. As we've said in the past, our approach
towards retail has been to really try to reduce that portfolio over the last five years, which we've been pretty
successful at, but where we do have exposure it's none of the big box – I shouldn't say none, but I mean very little
of the big box regional type retail exposure where our – a great majority of our retail exposure exists is in the
towns and communities that we have banks, and so these are the downtown suburban type operators. And I think
that there are still going to be viable operations going forward, but I don't know when. But generally speaking I feel
that that's going to rebound better than most but it is one of those with that I – people are shopping on Amazon,
and the numbers are obvious but dramatically higher levels and I don't think that you're going to see reversion
back to what we've seen in the past. I think those people's shopping habits are going to change in a pretty
meaningful way going forward.

Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Murph and I talk about that a lot. I say, you're going to keep my wife out of shopping, you're crazy. And
you're going to keep me here at the office, I'm going to the office. She'll kick me out. So there's a lot of
[indiscernible] (00:55:28) we have to wait and see but I think as Murph says, we're diversified enough, know our
borrowers enough. I think we will know – everybody's bought two three months with PPP loans with deferrals and
the like even in offices and what have you. We'll know in two to three months how this is going to shake out where
it's going to go and how it's going to work. So, I think that we're kind of in a limbo. We've got to get out of this and
then we'll see if all this happens, but we'll be very cognizant of it already in any underwriting we're doing or – and
some of the new stuff is going to be very cognizant, but we'll be very careful for sure because good loans are
made in bad times but you got to – you have to have a better crystal ball of where – the type of assets that you
will take as collateral.

Q1 2020 Earnings Call 22-Apr-2020
Hey, Ed. How are you doing? Question – kind of a high level question, in the past you've talked about the rope-a-
dope and not the need to go there. What would it take for you to pivot? Is it these two to three months and we
don't get the outcome we're looking for? I'm just interested in your thoughts and what may pivot the bank strategy
more significantly? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, the rope-a-dope before was really brought out by two things. One is we couldn't get paid for the risk we were
taking and so it didn't mean our profitability models pretty much any to deal out there. And secondly, we were
seeing way too many critical exceptions to loan policy and we just said we're not going to do that. We have not –
the spreads are actually moving up on the lending side, which is a good thing. So we're meeting our profitability
models there, and we are very closely monitoring exceptions. That's something could slow us down a little bit if it's
– in terms of making new loans and the like is if guys are given too many exceptions. But I think we're seeing
people pull back enough that this may have – sounds goofy – this may but a but a timely crisis because we have
started seeing people scrounging for yield as rates went down to zero again and taking more risk. But now this
has brought everybody back and they're thinking – I think we're rationally about pricing and collateral, what have
you. We'll see if we got this or they revert back to the goofy stuff, but who knows. Murph?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I've been – absolutely agree with that. I think while it wasn't rope-a-dope in back half of 2019 and the first
part of 2020, we were having trouble really growing C&I opportunities because there were just a lot of people in
that same space fighting at structures and pricing that just made no sense for us. And the [ph] CNBF (00:58:38)
market was very active in the CRE space. I would agree with what Ed said, I mean, the market had gotten goofy
and way too aggressive. And this crisis certainly has snapped back those trends pretty dramatically.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
It was pretty interesting for us as the kind of the halo effect that we got from our PPP work where our competitors
were unable to service their clients and they call us and maybe we knew the owner or whatever, had a personal
account or what have you, we had some relationship with them, we were able to get them on and service them. A
large bank in town hardly did any of – the oldest, largest bank that were – our competitor didn't do any hardly and
that's opened up an opportunity for us to pick up really solid opportunities going forward and at reasonable
pricing. So, it could be a little bit of a godsend.
So, rope-a-dope right now, who knows. We see opportunities for growth right now at our pricing, our parameters
for good solid long-term companies that are in the higher impact risk areas that – lot of people do a lot of hotel
loans right about now, do a lot more restaurant loans, but a lot of really solid other businesses that we're going to
have shots that we've never had before, so kind of mixed right now, but we're obviously very vigilant in terms of
what's going on because as Dave pointed out earlier about CECL, who the hell knows where we're going to end
up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Christopher McGratty Q
Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Thanks for that. That's good color. Just one more question on the PPP. Obviously the – we all may try and make
our assumptions on where the economy is going, but it seems like the banks are going to generate a tremendous
– I think you said almost $100 million of fees. I guess, the question becomes, I know you're bound by the models,

but when it seem conceptually the right thing to do just to put this back into the reserve and make people feel a bit
better about adequacy for the industry?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, we got to go with the black box and see where it goes, but I would just say that we – who knows when that
money – that money can come in over two years, over one year, over six months. I don't know when it's coming
in. I look at them independently. The reserve will be what it is and the PPP fees will be what they are and never
the twain shall meet. I think we have the – we really don't have a lot of art left in the box and we'll see where it
goes. But I would imagine if the things turn bad, you can [indiscernible] (01:01:20) qualitative things it would go
over the top and match it up nicely. Who knows? You got to look [indiscernible] (01:01:25) my point and...

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. Yeah. I still think you think about it sort of the 26.5% to 27%. The first quarter because the stock price was
down so much that benefit we usually get in the first quarter from stock based compensation was actually
negative a little bit. And the BOLI adjustment was actually negative a little bit. So I think I still look at sort of a
normalized tax rate to be 26.5% to 27%.

Doing well. I wondered if I had managed to pop in the queue. So it's great. I was wondering given your comments
about the outlook and a number of banks I've talked about how their outlook squared with Moody's as Moody's is
working on with so much of the industry and whether they use the base case of the adverse outlook, could you
touch on that and what you consulted outside for kind of a reality check on the outlook?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yes. I mean so we look at a lot of different things, I mean you look at the base case, you look at the severity, you
look at the long end of the pandemic when we run the models on all of it, we talk to our business people. So we
look at blue chip, the blue chip economists' models and we look at the consensus Moody's models. And so – but
we have to pick – at the end of the quarter, you have to pick a scenario and run with it. But then you're informed
by those other models that you run and the consensus blue chips – and the consensus and the blue chip models
that we compare and contrast against and then we get the qualitative input from our business leaders. So you
don't – you have to pick one to base your model off, but then there are qualitative factors that you had to layer on
because at some point you had to pick a scenario and run with it because you can't – Moody's was change in

scenarios weekly almost for this – for this thing. So then you took some – you ran some other models to find out
where the guardrails were on the ups and the downsides and then you square that with the business leaders that
have their fingers into the pulse of those scenarios and you [indiscernible] (01:05:04) the process. So I'd say we
were informed by a number of different Moody's models and other models out there.

and that's what we have – that's what we have right now, so.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Thanks. Hi, guys. Good morning. Wanted to ask some questions on just updated thoughts on capital planning and
priorities obviously with total risk-based capital coming down 30 basis points or so sequentially. And I obviously
understand [indiscernible] (01:07:24) can't project what credit costs are going to look like but just curious to kind of
get some updated thoughts on capital deployment priorities and how you guys kind of see capital levels projecting
to the extent you can kind of predict just given all the uncertainty that exists today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Well, I mean, we look at – we look at our capital levels all the time and we go through stress analysis on them, the
PPP loans are going to be capital free from a risk-based perspective, so that's not going to impact us, it's going to
be short-term in nature anyway. We're still generating positive earnings this quarter and expect to do so going
forward. We've suspended the share repurchase but that was prudent to do. I still believe the dividend is
appropriate but we'll let the board of directors decide that as they move forward. But we continue to think capital's
adequate.
We would look – I mean, if we continue to grow or there – we have these opportunities that talks about and we
have growth opportunities out there and the equity markets opened up, we could look at some preferred or some
sub-debt, but it's not critical that we do that right now but we're always watching those markets because we do
expect to continue to grow, so.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. We won't be spending [indiscernible] (01:08:54) cash on acquisition where stock price [indiscernible]
(01:08:57) make much sense. So, I think that Dave laid out nicely, our growth is [indiscernible] (01:09:02) zero-
based risk ratings and we keep a close eye on the whole thing and we do – we run more stress test, I think, than
most people do. And we feel very comfortable where we are right now, but it depends on our growth prospects
other than the non – with the zero-based risk rating stuff. So, we feel very good about where we are and, well,
that's where we are.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Understood. That's helpful and speaking of the stress test, I think when you guys last submitted DFAST in 2017,
you guys indicated that you could have 2.8% cumulative losses in a severe adverse scenario. So I guess I'm just
curious as you guys have kind of stress tested the book more recently, I mean any kind of thoughts or guidance in
terms of kind of what you guys could see in that kind of adverse scenario under the current circumstances that
exist today?

David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
No, we haven't – we haven't disclosed that, Nathan, so – I mean, people can look at that stress test but that was a
– I'm not sure you can compare that any environment to this. I mean it may be a good environment as your best
one to look at, but we haven't disclosed the stress test in a couple of years either. To give you something on this
call like that, we'd have to – we'd have to give that more thought because we haven't done a DFAST stress test
per se that we've made public so far. So we do them internally but I don't have the numbers other than to tell you
right now that we believe with a tremendous amount of stresses we see that we're fine.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yes. [indiscernible] (01:10:48) general statement know that we do stress the portfolio and we feel that right we're
in pretty good shape.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Nathan J. Race Q
Analyst, Piper Sandler & Co.
Understood. And if I could just ask one more on PPP. I appreciate all disclosures in the deck notes that you guys
have funded relief through the PPP for, call it, 15% of those select high impact industries. So, I'm just curious
based on the pipeline of PPP loans you have where do you expect that number moving forward in terms of
providing that added cushion for those selectively high impact industries.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
[indiscernible] (01:11:28) the first round for our clients, most of them are down at round one, to go forward we're
actually – we've actually been reaching out into the neighborhoods to [indiscernible] (01:11:41) neighborhoods to
people who say they can't get the loans and really reaching out to our customers saying, hey, come on, we'll get
you in, because we really have this system nailed and we feel we're in pretty good shape. So we basically had the
portal open from now 4.5 hours maybe in total. In total we've taken into over 10,000 applications.
So we tried that, we closed it [indiscernible] (01:12:11) rather do some direct work to make sure that we covered
people who may not have been as fortunate to be there, but – or to have their data and understand what it is, we
really reached out to do that because – but really when you think of it most of our – most of the guys who are in
our troubled – in severely impacted industries we're the first guys in, they're not dumb. They're very smart people.
I will say that you might ask what motivates our people to do this. I think we've had a number of great notes from
people that if you think about it we're going to keep 10,000 businesses from probably bankruptcy in a lot of cases.
[indiscernible] (01:12:50) maybe average 30, 40 employees, that's 400,000 people, they all have four – an
average with their four dependents, that's 1.6 million people that we're affecting and let sleep easier every night
because for two months they're going to – their salaries, their benefits and that's what keep – kept our people
working until midnight 1:00, 2:00, 3:00 in the morning is doing the good we're doing. And how often do you have a
chance to touch that many people in your life much less in two weeks. So we feel very good about what we're
doing here and we think we're doing our contribution and as it relates to the impacted industries, they run right out
of the box, now we've to make sure those who really don't get it or get that. So that's what our focus has been in
the last rounds.

David John Chiaverini Q

I wanted to ask you about – how is it going? So I wanted to ask you about expenses. So in the past you've
mentioned about keeping the net overhead ratio below 1.5%. I think I heard you mention that it should be well
below 1.4%. So I was wondering is that the new bogey now less than 1.4%? Did I hear you right?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A

Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
[indiscernible] (01:14:37) get it but, 1.5% has always been the [indiscernible] (01:14:40) bank and I think that with
our growth and what's going on with our asset growth, and our expense control base, just what's going on here
[indiscernible] (01:14:52) ability to open branches and do things like we normally do right now, the rest of the
business plus the mortgage margins and how well we're doing there. I think that yeah, you should be well below
1.40%, I think we could even make it below 1.30% if things go right. But the bogey will be 1.50% – 1.50% or
better. We're not changing it yet. But I think we expected for the next few quarters to be below 1.40% and to be in
the 1.30%, 1.40% range and go for the lower than 1.30%, if we're good.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David A. Dykstra A
Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah, I think what said in my comments with the growth of the balance sheet related to PPP and the strong
mortgage markets and the lack of some of the expenses that are going to flow through just due to the situation
we're in travel, entertainment, some of the sponsorships of some of the summer events, et cetera, we should be

below 1.40% for the time being. But I agree with Ed, that's general target in the normal environment is still sort of
below the 1.50%. But yes I did say below 1.40% because I think in the near term quarters, that's still going to be
the case.

David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks for that. And how's your de novo outlook changed at all, previously you were planning about a
dozen branches over the next 12 to 18 months, has that backdrop kind of shifted your thinking on that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Not really, slowed it down a little, again, we've taken basically a couple months off of we're all in this hibernating, if
you will, but these are areas we're committed to. We have space, we're rolling and we're aware there are
opportunities for us to continue to build and grow and we've always invested in our business, we are a growth
company. The acquisitions aren't going as planned or they're not – the market [indiscernible] (01:16:46) price to
acquisitions, we will turn to de novo growth. These are basically all [indiscernible] (01:16:52), but the timing will be
probably more spread out than before.

David John Chiaverini Q
Analyst, Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then the last one for me on loan growth and you touched on a little bit earlier. But to be clear, you're
still expecting mid- to high-single digit growth, and in the context of line utilization rates and the drawdowns did
kind of surge at the end of the first quarter, could that be a headwind to loan growth if things start to normalize
and these companies start to pay down those drawdowns?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Rich?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. I think overall economic activity is certainly going to be muted in the remainder of the year. So that's going
to have an effect. I do think a couple of things that are going to be interesting to watch will be – I do think that this
halo effect is real that I think that we will have some real opportunities with customers that in the past we just
haven't had a lot of success with, that we would really like to bank. So I think that'll be a good opportunity. I think
the [ph] first insurance groups (01:18:04) also will continue to do reasonably well.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Edward Joseph Wehmer A
Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Ticket size [indiscernible] (01:18:09) nicely.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Richard B. Murphy A
Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer, Wintrust Financial Corp.
Yeah. So I think that there is going to be some good opportunity there. But clearly the economic growth going
forward is going to be a bit of a headwind.
