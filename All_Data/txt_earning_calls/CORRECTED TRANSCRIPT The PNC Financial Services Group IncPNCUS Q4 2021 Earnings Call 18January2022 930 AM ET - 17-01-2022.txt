William Stanton Demchak
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everybody. As you've seen, we had a strong fourth quarter and full year for
2021. We successfully completed the conversion of BBVA USA early in the fourth quarter, and have been running
hard as one bank since then. The transaction continues to meet or exceed our deal projections, and Rob will give
you some of those details.
I'm especially pleased by our ability to announce, close, and convert a transaction of this size inside of 11 months.
Challenges notwithstanding, we had the talent, the technology, and the strategy to accomplish this and to
combine our organizations in a way that will provide growth opportunities for years to come.
The acquisition positions us with a coast-to-coast presence and along with our continued organic growth
strategies, including our recent expansion into Las Vegas, we now have a presence in all of the top 30 US
markets. We're excited about the opportunity this presents, and we are confident in our ability to generate growth
by executing on our Main Street relationship-based model. That said, we recognize that we have a lot of work to
do in building out the new and expansion markets, which will be our primary focus in 2022.
BBVA obviously impacted our results for the full year, and Rob will walk you through the details. Excluding BBVA,
we generated record revenue, highlighted by strong noninterest income with broad-based contributions across
our commercial and consumer businesses. We also maintained outstanding credit quality and a very strong
capital position. While we continue to opportunistically deploy some of our excess cash into higher-yielding
securities throughout the year, we remain well-positioned with substantial excess liquidity to capitalize on a rising
interest rate environment.
Our reported results for the fourth quarter reflected the impact of almost $440 million of BBVA integration costs.
Excluding these, we generated nearly $1.6 billion of net income and solid returns. Importantly, excluding the
impact of PPP loan forgiveness, we saw decent underlying loan growth trends and some uptick in utilization rates,
which is very encouraging, as Rob will discuss in more detail.

Critical to our long-term success has been the quality and stability of our talent, and we pride ourselves as being
an employer of choice. Given the recent dynamics of the substantially increased competition for talent, in part due
to the Great Resignation, we experienced greater wage pressure during the fourth quarter, and I expect that to
persist into the coming year. Naturally, we'll look to offset these increases with our continuous improvement
efforts, which include driving further automation and rethinking core processes.
We continue to invest in technology to enhance our capabilities in an increasingly digital world. Customers are
looking to their financial providers to offer innovative tools that help them manage their money in ways that are
faster, smarter, and more convenient; whether that'd be expanded use cases for Zelle where transaction volumes
are up 50%, or Low Cash Mode. For example, by providing account transparency and control, Low Cash Mode
has substantially reduced customer overdraft fees and related complaints.
I'll close by thanking our employees for their hard work and steadfast commitment to our customers and
communities. Because of our employees, we had a remarkable year and are well-positioned to serve all of our
stakeholders in 2022 and beyond.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob for a closer look at our results. And then, we'll take your questions.

Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is on slide 5 and is presented on an average basis.
Overall, year-over-year balance sheet growth was primarily driven by the acquisition of BBVA USA. Loans grew
18%, investment securities increased 49%, and deposits grew 26%.
Looking at the linked-quarter changes, loans for the fourth quarter were $289 billion, a decline of $2.4 billion or
1%. Excluding $4.7 billion of PPP forgiveness activity, loans grew $2.3 billion or 1%. And I'll cover the drivers in
more detail over the next few slides.
Investment securities increased $7 billion or 6%, as we maintained higher purchasing activity throughout much of
the quarter. Accordingly, cash balances at the Federal Reserve declined by $5 billion.
On the liability side, deposit balances declined $1.6 billion as higher commercial and consumer deposits were
offset by runoff deposits related to the strategic re-pricing of certain BBVA USA portfolios during the third quarter;
and that negatively impacted fourth quarter average balances. However, on a spot basis, total deposits as of
December 31 increased $8 billion or 2%, reflecting the continued strong liquidity positions of our customers.
At year-end, our tangible book value was $94.11 per common share and our CET1 ratio was estimated to be
10.2%, which are both substantially above the pro forma levels we anticipated when we announced the deal.
During the quarter, we returned approximately $1.1 billion of capital to shareholders via common dividends of
$500 million and share repurchases of $600 million. Given our strong capital ratios, we continue to be well-
positioned with significant capital flexibility going forward.
Slide 6 shows our average loans and deposits in more detail. In the fourth quarter, loans declined $2.4 billion, as
growth in commercial and consumer loans was more than offset by a decline in PPP loans of $4.7 billion.
Excluding the impact of PPP, commercial loans grew by $2.2 billion or 1%, driven by growth in corporate banking
and asset-based lending.

During the fourth quarter, we continued to see a slow and steady increase in utilization rates within our Corporate
& Institutional Banking business and, along with that, expanded pipelines. Taken together, these factors are
driving our expectations for higher loan growth in 2022. Consumer loans increased modestly linked-quarter, as
higher residential real estate balances were mostly offset by lower home equity and auto loans.
Finally, as I mentioned, PPP loans continued to decline due to forgiveness activity. And as of December 31, $3.4
billion of PPP loans remained on our balance sheet. Average deposits of $453 billion declined by $1.6 billion
linked-quarter for the reasons I previously mentioned. Overall, our rate paid on interest-bearing deposits remained
stable at 4 basis points.
Slide 7 details the change in our average securities and Federal Reserve balances. As rates increased at the end
of the third quarter and throughout the fourth quarter, we continued to opportunistically add securities to our
portfolio, primarily US treasuries. As a result, securities balances averaged $128 billion in the fourth quarter, an
increase of $7.2 billion or 6% compared to the third quarter 2021, and now represent 26% of interest-earning
assets. We continue to have substantial excess liquidity, with Fed cash balances averaging $75 billion during the
fourth quarter, which we believe positions us well for a rising rate environment.
As you can see on slide 8, fourth quarter 2021 reported EPS was $2.86, which included pre-tax integration costs
of $438 million. Excluding integration costs, adjusted EPS was $3.68. As expected, during the fourth quarter, we
incurred essentially half of our total anticipated deal integration costs, which reduced revenue by $47 million and
increased expenses by $391 million.
Since the announcement of the acquisition, we've now incurred approximately 95% of the total $980 million
expected integration costs, including $120 million of write-offs for capitalized items. Excluding the impact of
integration costs, linked-quarter revenue was down $31 million or 1%; expenses increased $48 million or 1%; and
pre-tax pre-provision earnings declined $79 million or 4%. The fourth quarter provision recapture was $327
million, reflecting continued improvements in the economic environment. Net income, excluding pre-tax
integration costs of $438 million, was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter.
Now, let's discuss the key drivers of this performance in more detail. Turning to slide 9, these charts illustrate our
diversified business mix. Total revenue for the fourth quarter of $5.1 billion decreased $70 million linked-quarter,
reflecting lower noninterest income. Net interest income of $2.9 billion was up slightly, primarily a result of higher
securities balances. Net interest margin was stable at 2.27%.
As I mentioned, integration costs reduced noninterest income by $47 million, which included $19 million of lease
exit costs, $17 million of treasury management fee waivers, and $11 million of overdraft waivers.
Fourth quarter fee income, excluding integration costs, was $1.9 billion and declined $39 million, or 2%, linked-
quarter. Looking at the detail, asset management fees increased $3 million, or 1%, primarily related to higher
average equity markets. Consumer services grew $12 million, or 2%, due to higher brokerage and credit card
revenue. Corporate service fees increased $14 million, or 2%, reflecting higher loan syndications activity, as well
as continued elevated corporate advisory activity. Residential mortgage noninterest income declined $46 million,
driven by lower RMSR valuation adjustments and loan sales revenue.
Service charges on deposits decreased $22 million, primarily a result of converting BBVA USA customers to
PNC's product and overdraft pricing structure. Other noninterest income, excluding integration costs, was stable
linked-quarter as the impact of a $1 million positive Visa derivative fair value adjustment in the fourth quarter
compared to a negative adjustment of $169 million in the third quarter was offset by lower private equity revenue.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2022
Turning to slide 10, our fourth quarter expenses were up by $204 million, or 6%, linked-quarter. The growth was
primarily driven by $156 million increase in integration expenses. Excluding the impact of integration expenses of
$391 million, noninterest expense increased $48 million, or 1%. The growth was largely within personnel costs,
driven by higher employee benefits expense, an increase in our minimum hourly rate of pay, as well as elevated
incentive compensation related to strong fee activity.
We had a 2021 goal of $300 million in cost savings through our continuous improvement program, and we
successfully completed actions to achieve that goal. Looking forward to 2022, our annual CIP goal will once again
be $300 million. Importantly, as of year-end 2021, we completed all of the actions that will drive $900 million of
savings related to the BBVA USA acquisition, which we expect to be fully realized in 2022 and is reflected in our
expense guidance that I will provide in a few minutes.
Our credit metrics are presented on slide 11. Nonperforming loans of $2.5 billion decreased $48 million, or 2%,
compared to September 30th, and continue to represent less than 1% of total loans. Total delinquencies of $2
billion on December 31st, increased $516 million, or 35%. Obviously, this was a large increase but it was primarily
driven by BBVA USA conversion-related administrative and operational delays, which we expect will largely be
resolved within the first half of 2022.
Net charge-offs for loans and leases were $124 million, an increase of $43 million linked-quarter. Commercial net
charge-offs declined $5 million, offset by an increase of $48 million in consumer. Inside of the higher consumer
net charge-offs, auto grew $28 million and other consumer increased $13 million, reflecting conversion-related
impacts, as well as seasonality.
Our annualized net charge-offs to average loans continues to be low and in the fourth quarter was 17 basis
points. And during the fourth quarter, our allowance for credit losses declined $471 million, reflecting continued
improvements in the economic environment. At quarter-end, our reserves were $5.5 billion, representing 1.92% of
loans.
In summary, PNC reported a strong fourth quarter, which concluded a successful 2021, and we're well-positioned
for 2022 as we continue to realize the potential of our coast-to-coast franchise. In regard to our view of the overall
economy, we expect strong growth over the course of 2022, resulting in 3.5% GDP growth. We also expect four
25-basis-point increases in the Fed funds rate in 2022, beginning in May, followed by additional increases in
June, September, and December.
Looking ahead, our full year guidance for 2022 includes the impact of 12 months of BBVA USA results compared
to only seven months in 2021. Taking that into account, our outlook for full year 2022 compared to 2021 results is
as follows. We expect average loan growth of approximately 10% and 5% on a spot basis. We expect total
revenue growth to be 8% to 10%.
We expect expenses, excluding integration expense, to be up 4% to 6%. And to be clear here, this includes five
additional months of BBVA USA operating expenses, which equates to a full year increase of approximately $500
million. And we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18%. Based on this guidance, we expect we will
generate solid positive operating leverage in 2022.
Looking ahead at the first quarter of 2022 compared to the recent fourth quarter 2021 results, we expect average
loan balances, excluding PPP, to be up approximately 1% to 2%. We expect NII to be down approximately 1% to

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2022
2%, reflecting two fewer days in the quarter, and a decline of approximately $75 million in PPP-related interest
income.
We expect fee income to be down 4% to 6% due to seasonally lower first quarter client activity, as well as
elevated fourth quarter fees in certain categories. We expect other noninterest income to be between $375 million
and $425 million, excluding integration costs, as well as net securities and Visa activity.
Taking our guidance for all components of revenue into consideration, we expect total revenue to decline
approximately 3% to 5%. We expect total noninterest expense, excluding integration costs, to be down
approximately 4% to 6%. And during the quarter, we expect to incur $30 million of integration expense. And
finally, we expect first quarter net charge-offs to be between $100 million and $150 million.
And with that, Bill and I are ready to take your questions.

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a
reminder, this conference is being recorded. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Dave George
with Baird. Please proceed with your question.

David Alan George Q
Analyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Hey, guys. Good morning. I had a question about capital and capital allocation. You obviously finished the year at
10.2% CET1, which is ahead of kind of your initial targets when you announced BBVA. And your stock is at 2.3%,
2.4% of tangible book, and I know you've talked about taking the cash dividend payout up. So just kind of curious,
Bill, how you're thinking about capital allocation in the new year? And then I've got one follow-up.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, you kind of answered your own question because we're consistent. All else equal in this environment, first
focus on the potential of loan growth and using it a good way, a bias – strong bias towards dividend, but we'll still
be in the market to repurchase shares. And I think you'll probably see us accelerate some of the things we're
doing on the smaller side in terms of product activity, bolt-ons into TM and so forth. None of that – by the way,
those acquisitions won't add up to much, but they've become an important part of just adding core capabilities as
we go into a digitized world.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
David Alan George Q
Analyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Okay. Thanks for that. And then a question on your guidance; in particular, NII. I know you mentioned you've got
four hikes in there. I assume you're using the forward curve and the securities as a percentage of earning assets,
up to 26%. I know, Bill, you've talked about being 25% to 30%. Do you expect continued liquidity deployment?
Just kind of curious how much liquidity deployment is embedded in that number. Thanks.

Our forecast is, at this point, pretty much on the forward curve at this point. I think the plan – Rob, I don't know if
you want to talk to the plan of we're going to gradually add duration throughout the year. There wasn't any magic
to it, and we didn't really build in, in Rob's guidance some assumption that we would go at it even more
aggressively for each reacted...

John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
On the revenue guide for the full year of 8% to 10%, I just wanted to see if you could help unpack that a little bit in
terms of how you view the NII trajectory for the year and what type of growth you think is reasonable, versus the
trajectory on the fee income side of things, given some of the dynamics you flagged? Thanks.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Sure, John. So, full year revenue, up 8% to 10%. Break down those components; net interest income, up
low teens, and that does factor in the rate increases that we spoke about in the opening comments. And then on
the fees, mid-single digits year-over-year. So, those two together gets you to the 8% to 10%.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. All right. Thanks. That's helpful. And then on the loan growth front, just given the 10% end-of-period loan
growth expectations, certainly implies an acceleration that you indicated that you're seeing. Could you give us a
little more color on the growth trends that you think is achievable on the commercial side versus consumer? And
maybe what are you expecting to be the biggest drivers of that acceleration as you look at the loan book?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, sure. So for the full year guide, it's 10% average, but probably a better indicator is the spot just because of
the acquisition dynamics on the average number. So, spot up from period end 5%. And we see a continuation of
what we started to see in the fourth quarter, which was some expanded utilization in the commercial book picking
up through 2022. And then a little bit less on the consumer side. Consumer, customers are still pretty flush with
cash. So loan demand there, certainly in the first half of 2022, we expect to be softer than the commercial side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John Pancari Q
Analyst, Evercore ISI
Got it. That helps. Thanks. Yeah, I meant to say average on the growth.

Hi. Good morning.

Morning, Erika
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Wanted to follow-up on the questions on what's embedded in the NII guide. Rob, you answered the question on
what you're assuming for liquidity deployment. But what are you assuming in your NII guide about the trajectory of
deposit beta, and what do you think will actually happen?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, in terms of our guidance, Erika, what we apply in terms of beta is what we've seen in past cycles, which
generally speaking will be a lag on the front end. So, my expectation and what we built into the guidance is that
we will see some beta increase, but not until the end of 2022 and it will probably be more of a factor in 2023, just
because of the levels of liquidity and deposits that we have.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. Okay. So, if I'm comparing it to your previous deposit beta, in terms of, let's say, in 2015 to 2016 to 2017,
actually, the first 100 basis points, your guidance assumes a slower ramp than that?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
That's right. That's exactly right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Erika Najarian Q
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC
Got it. And the second follow-up question is for Bill. One of your peers, Jamie, had obviously given a guidance for
higher expenses in 2022, pointing to accelerated investment spend. As we think about this 4% to 6% – obviously,
some of this is the BBVA baseline – but did you front-load some of the investment spend in 2022? In other words,
as your investors start thinking about PNC's profitability in a normalized rising rate environment, is 4% to 6% an
appropriate guidepost for future growth in expenses going past 2022?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
No. No. So to unpack the guide for next year, I think the PNC legacy expenses are up maybe 1%.

.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. And so, did we prepack investment? We've said all along that we've had a steady state and actually a fairly
high level of investment in our core business. And then, you'll remember in the guidance for BBVA that in the
$900 million of cost saves, that was a netted number against investments we are going to make to build out those
markets. So inside of everything you're seeing there actually has a lot of investment already built into it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
And, of course, our continuous improvement of $300 million offsets the investments, and that's something that
we've been doing for a number of years.

William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I also think – it's worth noting, we've had some debate internally on the continuous improvement number and can
it be larger, because I think we all see opportunities in the operating environment as we move forward with BBVA.
The challenge is continuous improvement is something you know you can do, whereas right now we're still in the
process of we know it's there, we just don't know where yet. Once we kind of lock it down and can track it, it
shows up in continuous improvement.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. So two questions. One, just on how we're thinking about the reinvestment in the securities portfolio as we
think about the NII guide as well. Maybe you could give us a little sense of the pace that you're thinking about
reinvesting. I mean, what's baked into your NII guide? Because as we know, the forward curve does suggest
we're going to be hitting 2% pretty soon. So do you wait for that or do you start to leg in even at current rates?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
We will leg in throughout the course. But remember, what's in our guide on securities doesn't dent our liquidity
profile. So what we have in our guide here is kind of steady deployment working towards the 25% to 30%. We'll
add balances. It doesn't even dent the potential of what we could do with liquidity.

So it's a baseline budget, boring; the rates do this, we do the following. If rates go beyond or even if we get to a
place where we think rates have probably gone where they need to go, not as high as I think they'll go, we could
increase that. But that's not contemplated in the forecast that we have right now.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Because am I right in thinking your target range of securities to earning asset's like 25% to 30%. Is that fair?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yes.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
That's right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then, just to follow-up...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
But remember, inside of that mix, right, that's a big portfolio of securities. The big difference in the yield coming
out of buying short-dated treasuries, which has been kind of our recent trade versus going further out the curve
and going back towards mortgages once you assume the extension risk is taken out. Massive difference in yields.
So some of it's notional of securities, some of it's what you're actually buying. And both of those will be driven by
the speed and outlook for rates over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Right. So what I'm hearing is baseline in the expectation, but upside as we approach kind of rates reflecting your
view of full extension risk on the RMBS side.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, no. If my individual view is right, there's a lot of upside. But the forecast that we've given you and what's
kind of in our plan is steady state, follow the forwards and leg in over time.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, in simpler terms, the yields on the securities portfolio can change a lot.

Betsy L. Graseck Q
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Right. Right, right, right. I got it. Okay. And then separately, just thinking a little bit longer-term, Bill, on the
investments that you're doing. Could you just give us a little bit of color as to what are you looking for in these
bolt-on acquisitions to enhance your digitization? What pieces of your digitization are you looking to improve? And
also, is there a need for reinvestment in branches in the new geographies, where maybe you would have had a
slightly different skew to the branch mix? Just trying to understand a little more detail out there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Two very different questions. As you've seen, we've done a number of small things, Tempus probably being the
most interesting one where we bring in certain payment capabilities that lead to other opportunities. And we see
more and more of those. By the way, we're not unique at that. A lot of banks are playing in the space. They're not
terribly expensive, but oftentimes, you get modules of technology that can be sort of bought into and then scaled
across your broader platform. I just think you're going to see more of that as we continue to compete in a digital
space for both the consumer and the corporate.
On the branch side, we have plans to further, as we always do, kind of build out selectively in the markets where
we're underpenetrated. But at the same time, you'll see us continue our practice of consolidating the thicker
markets. So, no real change there and all that's in the numbers we've given you.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2022
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
Can you guys give us a little color, I'm trying to figure out what we're going to be talking about in the fourth quarter
earnings call for 2022 in January of 2023. And I think credit might be a subject that receives more attention then.
Can you share with us your underwriting standards, how you compare them today to, let's say, right at the start of
the pandemic? And then comparing them to 2019, how they look compared to today?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
So, you've got to separate something. Our credit box per se, right, so the type of clients we lend to, the leverage
they can have, all the things you would otherwise measure, we really don't change that over time. Having said
that, of course, even inside of that box, companies are doing better or they are doing – trending more poorly. I
think we're going to go into a period of time here as we go towards the end of the year where, all else equal, there
will be pressure on credit; not because we changed our underwriting standards, but because of the
upgrade/downgrade ratio will change.
Rob and I were talking before the call, if you actually look at our reserve ratio, particularly when you adjust it for
credit cards, I can't think of a period of time where you're kind of going into rising rate environment, which is going
to help us; loan growth, which is going to help us; and feeling healthy reserves when you compare where we are
versus – I'll just call it that – versus the rest of the industry in terms of raw percentages against balance, and our
book through legacy performance.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
And resulting from the unique dynamics of the pandemic. So it's an unusual setup.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Yeah. Yeah.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2022
Gerard Cassidy Q
Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC
...can you share with us or give us more color, are they coming from the newer markets that you guys have
entered over the last five or six years; or are you seeing early traction with the BBVA customers? Maybe if you
could dissect where some of them might come from in 2022.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Well, the new money out, right, so the new clients and new money that we are committing, whether it's drawn or
not, has accelerated for the last bunch of months and a lot of that is related to the newer markets we're in,
including some big wins coming out of the BBVA markets. The utilization part, right, so the money is out, now is
somebody borrowing more under what line, is broad-based. And if you just think about how many clients we have,
it's kind of distributed across everything.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. The other thing that I'd add to that, Gerard, is that the pipelines in our commercial book are strong. And in
the new markets, they're up percentage-wise significantly.

Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
[indiscernible] (00:35:18)
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. Is largely the economy, right? The assumptions where we marked credit and looked at credit turned out to
be wildly conservative, but – and that's what we saw at that point. But better than expected. If I look at it, I think
the teams that we've been able to deploy in the market, some of the talent that BBVA had, some of the talent we
were able to hire, that the amount of call volume that we're having in the new markets with new products and old
clients and with new products and people with new clients, all sort of wildly outpacing what we were able to do
with RBC in our newer markets in the past. And then just wins, showing up with clients early on.
So, that's kind of all in the business momentum side and continues to give us comfort on our ability to build out
the markets. The credit is a lot better than we thought. The expense guide, we go out there and we say, we'd take
$900 million including investment, and we stick to that. But to Rob's point, you guys know this of us through time,
it doesn't mean that we're going to stop looking once we hit our expense guide. And I guess I'd just leave it there.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Where you're leaving it is, I guess, was really my question. So, why not increase your expense saving target or
quantify that? Is that because you're reinvesting it, or you're just being conservative, or you're just waiting longer?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I think the easiest way to answer that is when I was talking about continuous improvement a little while ago, Mike.
We kind of know there's stuff there through some metrics and some thought process today. But until we can put
an action plan together, quantify it, know how we're going to measure it, I can't – I'm not just going to throw an
expense guide in there that probably is embedded, but I'm not sure.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
And I just think – this is Rob, Mike – I just think it's premature. So, we worked hard in 2021 to get that $900 million
in savings into that $1.7 billion run rate. So, we got to get going, and this is the getting-going part.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Mike Mayo Q
Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC
And then, I know part of your – you're in all top 30 US markets now, and I know you want to expand. And so you
did guide for, you said, solid positive operating leverage for the year. I get that. On the other hand, isn't it getting a
lot more expensive to hire people to help with that expansion in the new markets?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
It is, but we've largely hired them off. You need to understand, when we closed and then converted, we had
basically the teams built out in all of these markets, Mike. So they're in our run rate.

Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Thanks. Good morning, Bill and Rob. Following up on your deposit beta commentary. How are you thinking about
the risk that balance sheet run-off, the potential impact it could have in this cycle versus the last one, given that
it's expected to play a bit bigger role versus when we exited the last serve cycle?

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2022
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
It's a great question, and that's obviously going to impact it. And in the extreme, if they shrink their balance sheet
dramatically, it obviously would impact betas and make them higher. The offset to that, though, is you got to
remember with loan growth, you actually create deposits, right? So if loan growth does pick up, bizarrely as the
Fed is dropping their balance sheet, which isn't unlikely, that loan growth actually generates deposits. If you think
about just the leverage on the capital you hold for a loan and the money goes everywhere else.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Right.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
So I'm not sure I've iterated my way through exactly how that's going to play out, other than it feels like the
combination of those two things should leave us extremely liquid deposit-wise for the next several years.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Which is our base expectation, but you've got to keep an eye on it.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Yeah. That makes sense. I guess continuing on that thought process, Bill, do you feel PNC is perhaps a little bit
less exposed than some of the larger banks that are primary dealers and more directly involved in the creation of
those deposits under the QE process?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
I don't think the system works that way. If the Fed shrinks its balance sheet, you will likely see corporate cash – I
don't know that you can think through it that way. I think it transmits through the banking system, and I think it hits
everybody largely the same as a function of their corporate and consumer mix. But corporates behave like
corporates and consumers behave like consumers.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Bill Carcache Q
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC
Got it. And then lastly, I think you touched on this, but just to put a finer point on it, if the pipelines of strong loan
growth trends that you're describing persist, I guess, maybe if you could just comment on your willingness to – or
the extent to which that influences your willingness to take your securities portfolio as high as 30%? I guess, do
you think your liquidity is sufficient to be able to do both, fund that stronger loan growth...

Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just wanted to follow-up. Rob, I think you had mentioned when you broke
down the revenue guide is that you're looking at mid-50s, in the mid-single digits, and obviously that also includes
the BBVA stuff.

Ken Usdin Q

Last year, you had a ridiculously great year for corporate services especially. I'm just wondering underneath the
surface, what do you see as being the underlying growth drivers outside of the BBVA rollover?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. I would just say if you're taking a look at the full year, Ken, just going through the categories, asset
management, we would expect to continue to increase in that mid-single digit range. Consumer, higher than that,
in part due to the addition of the BBVA franchise.

Q4 2021 Earnings Call 18-Jan-2022
But as you hit it on corporate services, we had such elevated levels in 2021, our expectations for 2022 are down a
bit. Residential mortgage may be up a little bit. And then, service charges on deposits down as we get the full
year effect of reduced overdraft fees that we expect from Low Cash Mode. So you put all that together, that's how
you get to mid-single digits.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay, got it. And then same thing in terms of just how you're thinking about that other category, is it still within the
kind of zone you're thinking about for the first quarter? Is that how you think about it for the full year?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

That is, yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
Okay. One little clean-up, just on securities yields, Rob. Last quarter, you had that negative impact from the
BBVA...
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
We did that. Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Ken Usdin Q
Analyst, Jefferies LLC
...portfolio mark. And then this quarter, it was flattish, even I would think with the absence of that. So can you kind
of just work us through what was the impact in the fourth quarter, if any? And are you at the point where you're
seeing better reinvestment yields?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah, we're starting to. I think investment yields was the story on the premium amortization issue of the third
quarter, which was elevated. It went down in the fourth quarter, but it's still elevated over what I would consider
normal levels. So that worked against us a little bit as well.

John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Hey, guys. One more on the expenses. It's pretty impressive for the expense guide for 2022, if I look at it relative
to kind of fourth quarter annualized, it implies a quarterly run rate that's about 5% lower, Rob. So I guess just kind
of unpacking that, is the fourth quarter this year a little high because of such strong capital markets revenues?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
And then, how are you eating inflation and still getting cost to be 5% lower year-over-year when other banks are
having a lot of inflationary pressures? That would be helpful.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. No, you hit it. It's definitely on the wage side in the fourth quarter. And it just goes back – as we go into
2022, it goes back to what we were saying earlier in terms of how we laid out the year. We have the cost saves
locked in for the BBVA side. We have investments on the non-BBVA side that are largely offset by our continuous
improvement numbers. So, that's how we put it all together, and that's the plan.
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
William Stanton Demchak A
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Hey, John, just because I know all of our employees are listening, this plan assumes that we are paying people
competitively in a competitive market for talented people. We just need to find the dollars elsewhere to be able to
do that.

John E. McDonald Q
Analyst, Autonomous Research
Okay, got it. And then one industry-type question for you guys. You have a lot of reserves relative to peers, mix
adjusted on every basis. But we've never seen like CECL working in a loan growth environment. So just kind of
your guys' thoughts as loan growth starts to pick up for the industry, could we start to see some growth math
where you need to add provisions and add to reserves just for growth? Or is the 5% growth like contemplated in
your reserves today; or as loan growth picks up, do you have growth-driven provisioning?
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Robert Q. Reilly A
Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
Yeah. I can answer that one, John. That's complex. And in some instances, I don't know if we know because we
haven't run CECL through an environment like that. But academically speaking, we will get to the point where we
will need to grow reserves in concert with bigger balance sheets, bigger loan balances. But we're still in this place
